November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"
August 2023,Reservation process impossible,"Reservations impossible 
It’s impossible to get a table here. Other than staying up until after midnight to get the date change on open table.

The one that got away !More"
July 2023,A Memory you will not forget,"This was a culinary treat beyond what anyone in our party of 4 expected. The food was beautifully prepared. The service was a choreography of servers about 25 people weaving in and out without traffic jams. 
I knew it was going to be special when...one of the chefs came to our table and asked without any pretense if we flew in to eat at Core. 
It was pricey, but it is a lifetime sense memory. One I will not forget.More"
July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
August 2021,Perfection,From the moment we arrived the service was outstanding. The food was simply the best I have tasted. A relaxed atmosphere completed the triumvirate of perfection. The three Michelin Stars are thoroughly deserved. We’ll done to everyone involved. And thank you.

選んだメニューは65ポンドの3コースセットメニューにハウスシャンペンとイタリアの赤ワイン。私の選んだスターターは 'Potato and roe' dulse beurre blanc, herring and trout roe、ジャガイモに魚の卵を乗せた料理、芋の甘みと卵の塩気が絶妙のバランスでした。メインは Oxtail stuffed Roscoff onion beef short rib これもオックステールのゼラティンとオニオンの組み合わせが抜群、デザートは Lemonade parfait honey and yoghurt これもレモンの酸味と蜂蜜の甘さプリッとしたヨーグルトの食感が何とも言えぬ余韻。
トータルのお勘定は一人125ポンド（2万円弱）、少々お高いがこのお料理とサービスの対価としては納得。ウェイター、ウェイトレスのサービスも超一流、昨年（2017年夏）の開店なので現在は、Michelin, AA 或いは Good Food Guide の何れにも記載されていませんがオーナーシェフのクレア・スミスは3星レストラン ゴードンラムジーのシェフの実績があり、年内には各ガイドの高い評価を受けると確信しています。"

November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More

November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary.

Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life.

July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will.

Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had.

August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,A Memory you will not forget,"This was a culinary treat beyond what anyone in our party of 4 expected. The food was beautifully prepared. The service was a choreography of servers about 25 people weaving in and out without traffic jams.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had.

We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had.

July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.

We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked!

May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having.

Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had.

July 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More

November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,A Memory you will not forget,"This was a culinary treat beyond what anyone in our party of 4 expected. The food was beautifully prepared. The service was a choreography of servers about 25 people weaving in and out without traffic jams.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish.

November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had.

July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.

November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"

July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so.

October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will.

November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation.

November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"

November 2023,Disappointing ,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,One Of The Best….,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life.

July 2023,amazing,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

May 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.

October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.

We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"

July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"

The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent.

I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat!

Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.

Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had.

July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"

August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More

August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,A Memory you will not forget,"This was a culinary treat beyond what anyone in our party of 4 expected. The food was beautifully prepared. The service was a choreography of servers about 25 people weaving in and out without traffic jams.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"

Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"

September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"
August 2023,Reservation process impossible,"Reservations impossible 
It’s impossible to get a table here. Other than staying up until after midnight to get the date change on open table.

July 2023,A Memory you will not forget,"This was a culinary treat beyond what anyone in our party of 4 expected. The food was beautifully prepared. The service was a choreography of servers about 25 people weaving in and out without traffic jams. 
I knew it was going to be special when...one of the chefs came to our table and asked without any pretense if we flew in to eat at Core. 
It was pricey, but it is a lifetime sense memory. One I will not forget.More"
July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"

November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation.

July 2023,amazing,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"

July 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More

November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"

None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce.

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"
August 2023,Reservation process impossible,"Reservations impossible 
It’s impossible to get a table here. Other than staying up until after midnight to get the date change on open table.

July 2023,A Memory you will not forget,"This was a culinary treat beyond what anyone in our party of 4 expected. The food was beautifully prepared. The service was a choreography of servers about 25 people weaving in and out without traffic jams. 
I knew it was going to be special when...one of the chefs came to our table and asked without any pretense if we flew in to eat at Core. 
It was pricey, but it is a lifetime sense memory. One I will not forget.More"
July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed!

I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Disappointing ,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,One Of The Best….,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,amazing,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,Reservation process impossible,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,"This was a culinary treat beyond what anyone in our party of 4 expected. The food was beautifully prepared. The service was a choreography of servers about 25 people weaving in and out without traffic jams.

It was pricey, but it is a lifetime sense memory. One I will not forget.More"
July 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More

November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed!

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"

August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary.

Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"

The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,A Memory you will not forget,"This was a culinary treat beyond what anyone in our party of 4 expected. The food was beautifully prepared. The service was a choreography of servers about 25 people weaving in and out without traffic jams.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"

And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so.

May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so.

October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will.

Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"

November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had.

July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

May 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More

July 2023,A Memory you will not forget,"This was a culinary treat beyond what anyone in our party of 4 expected. The food was beautifully prepared. The service was a choreography of servers about 25 people weaving in and out without traffic jams.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had.

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"

The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent.

I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat!

Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.

Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had.

July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"

August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More

August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,A Memory you will not forget,"This was a culinary treat beyond what anyone in our party of 4 expected. The food was beautifully prepared. The service was a choreography of servers about 25 people weaving in and out without traffic jams.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"

Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"

September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,A Memory you will not forget,"This was a culinary treat beyond what anyone in our party of 4 expected. The food was beautifully prepared. The service was a choreography of servers about 25 people weaving in and out without traffic jams.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"

November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"

November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"

None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce.

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed!

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had.

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.

Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"

August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary.

Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"

The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,A Memory you will not forget,"This was a culinary treat beyond what anyone in our party of 4 expected. The food was beautifully prepared. The service was a choreography of servers about 25 people weaving in and out without traffic jams.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"

And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had.

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so.

October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will.

Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,A Memory you will not forget,"This was a culinary treat beyond what anyone in our party of 4 expected. The food was beautifully prepared. The service was a choreography of servers about 25 people weaving in and out without traffic jams.

It was pricey, but it is a lifetime sense memory. One I will not forget.More"
July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"

November 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Disappointing ,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,One Of The Best….,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,amazing,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"

August 2023,Reservation process impossible,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More

November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.

July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"

The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent.

I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat!

Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.

Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had.

July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"

August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More

August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,A Memory you will not forget,"This was a culinary treat beyond what anyone in our party of 4 expected. The food was beautifully prepared. The service was a choreography of servers about 25 people weaving in and out without traffic jams.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"

Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"

September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,A Memory you will not forget,"This was a culinary treat beyond what anyone in our party of 4 expected. The food was beautifully prepared. The service was a choreography of servers about 25 people weaving in and out without traffic jams.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation.

November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"

None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"

I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it!

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary.

November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce.

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed!

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
November 2023,Faultless,"I love a dirty burger or a good pizza, fine dining is something I don’t mind once in a while but it wouldn’t necessarily be my preference. Despite all of this, Core is without any doubt in my mind, the restaurant I have eaten best...meals I’ve ever had.

Been incredibly fortunate to have eaten here a few times and each experience has been incredible. Beautiful venue, light and classy without being over pretentious, wonderful views into the kitchen alongside attentive and friendly staff from the front of house, Rob the restaurant director, Gareth the Sommelier to each chef who comes out to describe the dish they have lovingly, proudly and expertly prepared. 

No matter how many times I have a few of the same dishes, it never tires. I could eat that bloody amazing potato over and over again.

All in all superlatives aren’t going to do the talent behind this venue enough justice. If you’re in the position to splurge on this extreme luxury and are prepared to work for a reservation, make this your number one destination.More"
November 2023,Somewhat disappointed,"Been several times before  and marvelled at everything but this time found it different.  Firstly the decor had changed and it didn't feel as airy as it used to.  Numerous staff, all attentive and knowledgeable but this time a couple of disappointing dishes especially the...small piece of turbot which was hard and yellowish and the accompanying kelp and shell fish didn't enhance it. Tasted very fishy!  The Forest dessert looked spectacular but too much pastry and was glad there were a few chocolate leaves.  My husband's chocolate Malteser confection was wondrous but had loved it previously.
Amuse gueules  were extremely artistic but the lobster roll was disappointing.  Wonderful bread and butter.
Lovely finishing touch with warm chocolate tarts and boozy jellies.More"
November 2023,The Pinnacle of Gastronomy,"I visited Core for lunch yesterday with my fiancé and friends of ours. Core has always been number one on my list of restaurants to visit and I was luck enough to go and to experience it yesterday. 

Our table was difficult for the kitchen...and the waiters as one of us had a shellfish allergy and I myself am allergic to Fish. 

From the second we were seated, we were attended to, from getting up to use the restrooms or filling up water, you were always looked after. The level of service was astounding, to go to the restroom and to come back and see you napkin folded neatly and your water topped up was astonishing, this even led to a game with the waiter where we left our napkins folded before we left to see if we would pass their high standards(to which only one of us succeeded) 

The whole table opted for the Core ""Classics"" menu, which had alterations for both of the allergen diners. The Amuse Bouche was delicious with the highlight being the pumpkin Gougere which was just an explosion of flavour. 

The scallop tartar was stunning, fresh and very refreshing, and served absolutely beautifully. 

The Cep tartlet which I had substituted for the roasted cod, was absolutely phenomenal and full of different flavours which worked harmoniously.

Now, the chicken and cockles dish came to the table and looked absolutely stunning, however I had been served caviar with mine which I cannot eat! I informed the staff member politely and it was rectified and dealer with in extreme haste, to the point where there was no disruption to the meal and the staff were extremely apologetic even though I was not too fussed! 

Even though they didn't have to, they kindly made ammends to the small mistake and gifted the table the wine pairing for the rest of the meal, the highlight being the apple brandy paired with the core apple, which was mindblowing!
The staff also brought out two ""core""-teasers along with the Eton mess as they knew I was excited to come try as much as I could! 

The Pear & Verbena Eton mess, the best thing I've ever eaten. UNREAL.

And to finish off with the most indulgent chocolate tart and boozy wine gums was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

I also left my core cookbook there as I was hoping chef clare would be there to sign it as her cooking is a massive inspiration to me, unfortunately she wasn't there but the staff are keeping hold of it to post back to me when she has signed it, if this doesn't show you the level of care from the core staff nothing will. 

Also thank you Chef Johnny for the picture !

The best meal I have ever eaten and I give it my full recommendation. 

Thank you Core Team.More"
September 2023,Wonderful 70th birthday dinner,"An outstanding evening of extraordinary dishes, full of flavour, paired with perfect wines in a beautiful environment. Service was exemplary. It deserves all of it’s three stars and probably one of the very best meals we’ve had. It’s a very comfortable environment too , no...bling !
Meeting Clare Smyth and her team at the end was a pleasure.
Gluten free -no problem and right from the start the staff we aware without the need for reminding.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening and I just cannot believe how others ( claiming to eat 3 star food all over the world ) can find it “disappointing “More"
November 2023,Terribly disappointing. Three poor dishes out of seven for £235.,"What a disappointment! We had flown down from Shetland, and stayed in a hotel in London, in order to celebrate my son's birthday with dinner at Core. With the price of the meal, it was roughly a £3,000 trip, and all because my wife wanted...the Clare Smyth experience. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. We have eaten in lots of three Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this was the first time that we could not finish three of the seven courses. We chose the seasonal menu at £235 because it sounded fresh and interesting. The meal started with four amuses bouches, three of which were excellent. The only duffer was the lobster roll, where the ratio of bread to lobster was all wrong.
The menu started with the best crab dish I have ever tasted, but things went downhill very quickly. Smoked Fowey Mussels were small and tasteless, in a very odd leek and fennel sauce. None of us could see the point of the dish, and were certain that nobody in the kitchen had tasted the sauce. Then came the Cornish turbot. We love turbot, but this was small, dry and tasteless, with a very strange cucumber and kelp sauce. The Scottish cep  and white truffle tartlet was absolutely glorious.
Then came the theoretical star of the show, the Rhug estate venison, which was so tough it was inedible. We eat a lot of venison and this was so tough I would have been embarrassed serving it at a dinner party.
It is a very attractive restaurant space, with a huge army of staff, but somebody really needs to start tasting the food.
I get the feeling that they have disappeared up their own backsides. It was a nightmare getting the reservation in the first place. When I came to confirm the reservation, I was hung up on six times.
We would not return under any circumstances. The worst value dinner of my life.More"
October 2023,Disappointing ,"We visited Core for dinner last night and were sadly disappointed.  Having visited previously and having had an amazing meal I had high expectations but the standard just didn't compare to my last visit.  We selected the Core Classics menu and all food was beautifully...presented.  Standout dishes are the potato and apple (dessert) and the lamb jus with the carrot dish but the others were distinctly average in flavour.  Service was also VERY rushed - we had to ask twice if we could have more time between courses.  As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"

As soon as you put your fork down your plate is gone as there was always a server hovering nearby so it was very hard to have a private conversation.  We also had the wine pairing which was extremely disappointing and given the rush we were always double or triple parked! The pairing with the apple dessert was the best one of the night   The coffee is also very bitter!  With a bill  just under £1k including service of around £120 you would expect the whole experience to be flawless, sadly it wasn't this time....More"
August 2023,One Of The Best….,"I came here in August with 3 friends and honestly it was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life. We make an effort to go to a Michelin / fine dining establishment at least once a month and have eaten at...some spectacular places but all 4 of us left feeling we may have had one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Food, service, atmosphere - 10/10 - if you’re looking at this and thinking about going just please book it immediately!More"
July 2023,Unexpectedly unimaginative,"I should preface this for relevancy by saying I’ve had the pleasure of dining at several Michelin starred restaurants. 

We dined here for my 30th birthday and we left rather disappointed. Service was immaculate, the atmosphere sensational. We all had the seasonal tasting menu and...I had the wine pairing. The food was rather standard, there wasn’t any dish I’d say was really all that exceptional. 

The wine pairing was particularly disappointing; for such a high price point I expected a much higher quality of wine. Almost entirely new world with only a single Bordeaux inbetween. Very surprised and not pleasantly so. 

Regrettably nowhere near the kind of standard I would have expected from a restaurant with any level of star.More"
July 2023,amazing,"Amazing evening, for a very fussy eater they accommodated without hesitation - I ate more than i could have imagined on the taster menu. Thank you."
May 2023,Exceptional food and service - very special place ,"Took my sister for a special birthday dinner. The food is truly exceptional. The staff are out of this world good. Like amazing, possibly the best service experience I've ever had. Best dinner we've ever had. 
It's crazy expensive for the average person but this...was a special occasion that I'd been saving up for a while and it truly was a wonderful, memorable experience.More"
August 2023,“OFF THE CLOCK”,"Best restaurant by far that I have ever visited, it’s an “Experience” I’ve never seen so many staff in one place , the service and attention to details is just incredible and everyone is so helpful , every piece of food has an explanation to...it, one of the chefs comes to your table to see that you are enjoying your meal and to describe what’s on your plate, the food is absolutely delicious. I had the mushroom tart which has a much fancier name on the menu! It was absolutely delicious. I then had the card which was unreal, they give you food in between complimentary which is beautiful, I had a Maltese a desert which was absolutely insane. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it! This was such a treat and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to celebrate or spoil themselves. It was well worth it.More"
August 2023,Reservation process impossible,"Reservations impossible 
It’s impossible to get a table here. Other than staying up until after midnight to get the date change on open table. 

Tried many times - give up 

The one that got away !More"
July 2023,A Memory you will not forget,"This was a culinary treat beyond what anyone in our party of 4 expected. The food was beautifully prepared. The service was a choreography of servers about 25 people weaving in and out without traffic jams. 
I knew it was going to be special when...one of the chefs came to our table and asked without any pretense if we flew in to eat at Core. 
It was pricey, but it is a lifetime sense memory. One I will not forget.More"
July 2023,Lunch at Core,Enjoyed a nice lunch here today first time we’ve eaten at Core and it was delightful - the staff were very nice and very attentive ( there’s a lot of staff ) food was beautifully presented and tasted great - quite expensive but of course...that’s to be expected for a 3 ⭐️ Michelin restaurantMore
May 2023,Brilliant beautiful food but disappointing experience overall ,I have to say while the food was completely brilliant - absolutely beautiful and  delicious - I found the overall experience disappointing. There were too many people/wait staff moving around in a small space so it felt over stimulating and a bit rushed instead of...calm and restful.  And unfortunately my server wanted to charge me extra for a simple exchange of a vegetable dish from a different tasting menu than the one I was having. That felt ridiculously ungenerous and annoying for the cost of the tasting menu - never experienced that before in any other Michelin star restaurant - left a bad taste in my mouth! :)More
