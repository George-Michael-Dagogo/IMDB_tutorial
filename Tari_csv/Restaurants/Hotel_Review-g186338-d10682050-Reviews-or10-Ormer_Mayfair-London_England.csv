December 2019,Sophisticated Dining,"Sophisticated menu and wine list.  Great food and service.  
The absolute highlight was the Lobster Ravioli.  
We would definitely return."
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,Relaxed friendly atmosphere well worth a visit,"Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"

February 2023,40th birthday dinner,Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party.

September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.

October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"
May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.

February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party.

September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"
May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..

February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"

Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.

May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.

February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,Excellent ,"Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,Best meal of my life!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"

September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative. Special mention about the jelly pork which was bursting with flavor, light in the tongue and work of heart to look at! Service was wonderful and very friendly. A young exciting chef that...I would recommend!More"
March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite. Italian ambiance, Italian quality. If you want beers and burgers this might not be the place for you. Location is splendid, central and...my the tube. 5 star all the way.More"
March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"
May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..

February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"
May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative.

February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"
June 2023,Excellent food and service,"Very professional and friendly staff ❤️, absolutely lovely and impeccable service.  

Tasting menu and drinks were both absolutely excellent. 

Will definitely come back again !"
June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative.

A young exciting chef that...I would recommend!More"
March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite.

March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.

If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"
June 2023,Excellent food and service,"Very professional and friendly staff ❤️, absolutely lovely and impeccable service.  

Tasting menu and drinks were both absolutely excellent. 

Will definitely come back again !"
June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge. But Ormer’s chef, who offers regular, vegetarian, pescatarian and vegan menus, rose to the challenge. Outstanding meal AND...service!More"
April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative. Special mention about the jelly pork which was bursting with flavor, light in the tongue and work of heart to look at! Service was wonderful and very friendly. A young exciting chef that...I would recommend!More"
March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite. Italian ambiance, Italian quality. If you want beers and burgers this might not be the place for you. Location is splendid, central and...my the tube. 5 star all the way.More"
March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"

March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.

Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
October 2023,Excellent ,"Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"
August 2023,"Nice food, very high prices","We were so lucky to enjoy the tasting menu, delicious! The team were very professional, friendly and helpful. A wonderful treat"
April 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"Very nice food, very friendly staff, but very expensive.19 pounds for a starter, really??? Ok, very nice location but again too expensive...More"
June 2023,Best meal of my life!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"
May 2023,Excellent food and service,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.

April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar.

The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Quality and world class ,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative.

March 2023,A memorable evening,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite.

September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"
June 2023,Excellent food and service,"Very professional and friendly staff ❤️, absolutely lovely and impeccable service.  

Tasting menu and drinks were both absolutely excellent. 

Will definitely come back again !"
June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative. Special mention about the jelly pork which was bursting with flavor, light in the tongue and work of heart to look at! Service was wonderful and very friendly. A young exciting chef that...I would recommend!More"
March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite. Italian ambiance, Italian quality. If you want beers and burgers this might not be the place for you. Location is splendid, central and...my the tube. 5 star all the way.More"
March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home!

We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"
June 2023,Excellent food and service,"Very professional and friendly staff ❤️, absolutely lovely and impeccable service.  

Tasting menu and drinks were both absolutely excellent. 

Will definitely come back again !"
June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative. Special mention about the jelly pork which was bursting with flavor, light in the tongue and work of heart to look at! Service was wonderful and very friendly. A young exciting chef that...I would recommend!More"
March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite. Italian ambiance, Italian quality. If you want beers and burgers this might not be the place for you. Location is splendid, central and...my the tube. 5 star all the way.More"
March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"

March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.

Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"
August 2023,Excellent ,"We were so lucky to enjoy the tasting menu, delicious! The team were very professional, friendly and helpful. A wonderful treat"
April 2023,"Nice food, very high prices","Very nice food, very friendly staff, but very expensive.19 pounds for a starter, really??? Ok, very nice location but again too expensive...More"
June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"
May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"

June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative.

A young exciting chef that...I would recommend!More"
March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite.

March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"
June 2023,Excellent food and service,"Very professional and friendly staff ❤️, absolutely lovely and impeccable service.  

Tasting menu and drinks were both absolutely excellent. 

Will definitely come back again !"
June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative.

March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite.

March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home!

June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative. Special mention about the jelly pork which was bursting with flavor, light in the tongue and work of heart to look at! Service was wonderful and very friendly. A young exciting chef that...I would recommend!More"
March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite. Italian ambiance, Italian quality. If you want beers and burgers this might not be the place for you. Location is splendid, central and...my the tube. 5 star all the way.More"
March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"

March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"
August 2023,Excellent ,"We were so lucky to enjoy the tasting menu, delicious! The team were very professional, friendly and helpful. A wonderful treat"
April 2023,"Nice food, very high prices","Very nice food, very friendly staff, but very expensive.19 pounds for a starter, really??? Ok, very nice location but again too expensive...More"
June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"
May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"

Will definitely come back again !"
June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative.

A young exciting chef that...I would recommend!More"
March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite. Italian ambiance, Italian quality. If you want beers and burgers this might not be the place for you. Location is splendid, central and...my the tube. 5 star all the way.More"
March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"
June 2023,Excellent food and service,"Very professional and friendly staff ❤️, absolutely lovely and impeccable service.  

Tasting menu and drinks were both absolutely excellent. 

Will definitely come back again !"
June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative.

March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite.

March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home!

September 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,Excellent ,"Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.

This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar.

February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"

September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"

March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.

May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative.

March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite.

March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative. Special mention about the jelly pork which was bursting with flavor, light in the tongue and work of heart to look at! Service was wonderful and very friendly. A young exciting chef that...I would recommend!More"
March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite. Italian ambiance, Italian quality. If you want beers and burgers this might not be the place for you. Location is splendid, central and...my the tube. 5 star all the way.More"
March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"
May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.

September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home!

We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"
May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..

February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude.

February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"

Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.

Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative.

March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite.

March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.

May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"
June 2023,Excellent food and service,"Very professional and friendly staff ❤️, absolutely lovely and impeccable service.  

Tasting menu and drinks were both absolutely excellent. 

Will definitely come back again !"
June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative.

March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite.

March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative. Special mention about the jelly pork which was bursting with flavor, light in the tongue and work of heart to look at! Service was wonderful and very friendly. A young exciting chef that...I would recommend!More"
March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite. Italian ambiance, Italian quality. If you want beers and burgers this might not be the place for you. Location is splendid, central and...my the tube. 5 star all the way.More"
March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"

If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..

February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"
May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar.

February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party.

February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...

Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.

This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative.

March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite.

March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar.

February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..

February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"

February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"
May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"

September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"

Tasting menu and drinks were both absolutely excellent. 

Will definitely come back again !"
June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative. Special mention about the jelly pork which was bursting with flavor, light in the tongue and work of heart to look at! Service was wonderful and very friendly. A young exciting chef that...I would recommend!More"
March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite. Italian ambiance, Italian quality. If you want beers and burgers this might not be the place for you. Location is splendid, central and...my the tube. 5 star all the way.More"
March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"

March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"
May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.

October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"
August 2023,Excellent ,"We were so lucky to enjoy the tasting menu, delicious! The team were very professional, friendly and helpful. A wonderful treat"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"
May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar.

Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"

February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"
June 2023,Excellent food and service,"Very professional and friendly staff ❤️, absolutely lovely and impeccable service.  

Tasting menu and drinks were both absolutely excellent. 

Will definitely come back again !"
June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative. Special mention about the jelly pork which was bursting with flavor, light in the tongue and work of heart to look at! Service was wonderful and very friendly. A young exciting chef that...I would recommend!More"
March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite. Italian ambiance, Italian quality. If you want beers and burgers this might not be the place for you. Location is splendid, central and...my the tube. 5 star all the way.More"
March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home!

Tasting menu and drinks were both absolutely excellent. 

Will definitely come back again !"
June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative. Special mention about the jelly pork which was bursting with flavor, light in the tongue and work of heart to look at! Service was wonderful and very friendly. A young exciting chef that...I would recommend!More"
March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite. Italian ambiance, Italian quality. If you want beers and burgers this might not be the place for you. Location is splendid, central and...my the tube. 5 star all the way.More"
March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"

March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.

Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"
August 2023,Excellent ,"We were so lucky to enjoy the tasting menu, delicious! The team were very professional, friendly and helpful. A wonderful treat"
April 2023,"Nice food, very high prices","Very nice food, very friendly staff, but very expensive.19 pounds for a starter, really??? Ok, very nice location but again too expensive...More"
June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"
May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"

Will definitely come back again !"
June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative.

A young exciting chef that...I would recommend!More"
March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite.

March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.  
From the time we entered the restaurant, we had a marvelous experience. The service was attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was superb.
Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.
If you have the chance, dine here.   You won’t be disappointed.More"
June 2023,Excellent food and service,"Very professional and friendly staff ❤️, absolutely lovely and impeccable service.  

Tasting menu and drinks were both absolutely excellent. 

Will definitely come back again !"
June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative.

March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite.

March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home!

June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge.

April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"
April 2023,Fabulous experience,"We ordered the tasting menu which was absolutely amazing and so innovative. Special mention about the jelly pork which was bursting with flavor, light in the tongue and work of heart to look at! Service was wonderful and very friendly. A young exciting chef that...I would recommend!More"
March 2023,Quality and world class ,"Cutting edge service, superb tasting menu, insane wine pairing. World class service. Amazing drinks. A well oiled machinery. The kitchen is exquisite. Italian ambiance, Italian quality. If you want beers and burgers this might not be the place for you. Location is splendid, central and...my the tube. 5 star all the way.More"
March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"

March 2023,A memorable evening,"A wonderful 6 course tasting menu - flavour, texture, presentation, attention to detail, all served by a delightful staff with an understated theatrical flair. A truly memorable evening."
March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
September 2023,Top class relaxed fine dining,"Tucked away in the cellar of a hotel (Flemings hotel) in a narrow London street, it's easy to just walk by not knowing that you have a superb restaurant virtually at your feet...
A very intimate and tranquil dining room, open and spacy yet well...suited for low key conversations. 
Chef Sofian offers here a variety of tasting menus (with great vegetarian options) where local - at least British - ingredients are in the forefront. For instance: Cornish seafood and Cumbrian lamb, completed by vegetables from their own cultivations.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.

The menus can be accompanied with  wine pairings in a ""simpler"" (cheaper) package or a more prestigious selection.
We tried both with equal satisfaction.
For those who want to choose from the wine list an impressive selection is available - also by the glass, which is exemplary! 

Beautifully presented dishes - all with high refinement. And NONE was a dip! Very unusual.
We felt a crescendo all the way through the menu.

The menu is preceded by four amuses - equally elaborated. And of course, post dessert a bunch of mignardises is presented. Thus you'll end up with a total menu of well over 10 dishes.

Service is impeccable and the timing and pacing between dishes couldn't be better.
Ormer is far from understaffed and the hard working people on the floor showed ""fingertip feel"" for how to address various types of guests.

It's not cheap to eat and drink at Ormer, but for the quality throughout and the professional service it must be considered more than affordable.
In fact, this was one of our greatest dinner experiences all time!

Ormer is mentioned in the Michelin guide, but it's a mystery they don't have a star.
They certainly should have!

Highly recommended!More"
October 2023,"Fab food and service, small portions","Obviously a lot of choice in London and we took some time to choose a venue for an anniversary dinner.  We landed on Ormers after  a decent amount of research and we weren’t disappointed. 

We headed to the bar to start the evening, a low...lit cocktail bar at the back of the restaurant.  The service was immaculate and the extensive cocktail list was supplemented by  off menu requests.  The cocktails were fab (and strong) and the atmosphere reminded me of Milk & Honey in its glory days.  

On to the table, we were sat in a great corner table (would recommend if you’re requesting)  and greeted by the sommelier offering a selection of champagnes to start the night.  The menus came and you’re basically presented 2 tasting menus - the normal or the veggie.  We opted for the main tasting menu and then visited by the sommelier again to chat about the wines.  Ormers do do a matching wine selection but, given the tasting menu was mainly chicken and fish, we opted to just order a bottle of wine.  

The amuse bouche arrived and was 3 different dishes, all absolutely delicious.  This was followed by a Waldorf (basically a consumme) and then the fish and main course.  2 desserts followed as we opted not to take on the optional extra of a cheese plate.  The food was all absolutely delicious, however, the portions were TINY.  I know tasting menus do tend to have small portions, but we did leave debating whether we should grab something on the way home! 

The service was outstanding throughout and the whole experience was lovely.  Certainly recommended and four stars only because we could have done with either a few more courses or bigger portions!More"

June 2023,So wonderful you want to do it all over again!,"A luxurious experience dotted with multiple surprises and flavor combinations to tantalize any palate.

Upon entering the warm and welcoming Manetta’s Bar, make sure you try one of their cocktails tailored around famous British Novelists.  I chose the Twisted Martini with not only a fabulous...taste but so memorable in its artistic presentation.

Dinner was a continuation of the same attention to detail and flavors, presented on unique and beautiful porcelain plate ware.  Jerusalem artichoke velouté, White Asparagus with Mushrooms, Pigeon and Lancaster Strawberries were just a few of the highlights.  Each was paired with a beautiful wine chosen by the Head Sommelier, Sevetiskav Manolev.More"
May 2023,Best meal of my life!,"Had dinner here for our Anniversary.

Lorenzo, the manager was friendly and sought to our every need...the tasting menu was the best experience I’ve ever had each course was more delectable than the last.
If you eat with your eyes, this is the restaurant to eat in plating was exceptional and served with a flourish that made you feel special. They used all your senses to make the meal a fabulous experience..
We are not really drinkers, but the sommelier was attentive, even to a mid priced bottle of wine.

June 2023,Outstanding!!!,"Since I do not eat meat or shellfish, have lactose intolerance, and am on medication where I cannot have wine, chefs can find feeding me a challenge. But Ormer’s chef, who offers regular, vegetarian, pescatarian and vegan menus, rose to the challenge. Outstanding meal AND...service!More"
April 2023,"Fabulous tasting menu, wonderful dining experience","We began our evening at the Ormer Mayfair with martinis in the Ormer bar. We then moved into their beautiful art déco restaurant for a 6 course tasting menu paired with lovely wines.  Very attentive and pleasant wait staff.  Some of our standouts from the...tasting menus were the warm Iberico ham jelly, the cured Cornish mackerel, and the roast Anjou pigeon. Instead of dessert, we had a 14 cheese sampling. The best cheese course we’ve ever experienced. Lovely evening.More"

March 2023,Splendid!,"Outstanding epicurean experience at Omer. We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which is to exhaustive to write about. Sensational wine list and a wonderful, cosmopolitan staff. Bravo!"
February 2023,"Good food, poor service, no atmosphere",Food was very good but service was disappointing and maybe even a rude. The main waiter was not accommodating and a little condescending to guests in our party. It looks like they were trying a little too hard to be a Michelin style restaurant but...they didn’t get the balance right between food and service. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant.More
February 2023,40th birthday dinner,"Very special place. 8 course taster was incredible. How they come up with these meals I’ll never know. The staff were second to none. Knowledgable in every aspect. Can’t rate it highly enough. Special memory, thank you to the staff for being so kind!"
