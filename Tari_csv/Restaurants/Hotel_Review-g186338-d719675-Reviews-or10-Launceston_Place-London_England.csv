November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"
September 2023,Unbelievable food and an incredible skills and service !,"Myself, my partner and my friend enjoyed an incredible 9 course meal at Launceston Place in September and we were blown away with the skills Ben Murphy has and what he created for us. 

The restaurant has a lovely friendly atmosphere and the service was...second to none. 

The flavours and presentation in Ben‚Äôs cooking were just incredible. An extremely talented chef and we cannot wait to go back again soon!

Ben your extremely posh cheese toastie was SUPERB!More"
November 2023,"Innovative, creative & beautiful food with incredible atmosphere & service","One of my favourite meals of all time. This restaurant has such incredible elegance, class, warmth, energy - the list goes on!
The food was beautiful, creative & set our taste buds on fire!!

The staff were simply wonderful and couldn‚Äôt have been friendlier. They...were informative & funny and made our meal very enjoyable üòç

Please go to Launceston Place, you will not be disappointed! We had the chefs tasting menu with wine pairing - I highly recommend this choice :)

I have been telling all of my friends & family about how incredible this place is, nestled in a village in the middle of Kensington. We will be back - thank you so much to the hugely talented head chef Ben and his wonderful team.

October 2023,Exceptional lunch!,"Exceptional lunch! Food excellent. Service professional, attentive and super friendly! Food is always perfect at Launceston Place - never disappoints! See you soon! Kevin and Richard"
October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"
September 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"An amazing food experience with an excellent selection of wine, totally destroyed by rude and unpleasant service (except the sommelier ). Top restaurants need to ensure that they get everything right. Overall I am unable to recommend this restaurant, but if you are a foodie...and go with the expectation of poor service, then it will be worth it for the food and wine.More"

September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet. 

Would we return....no. Would we recommend...noMore"
August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu.

November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"

August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet. 

Would we return....no. Would we recommend...noMore"
August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu. This turned out to be a great choice - the food was superb in both presentation & flavour & the service excellent. There was...a good wine list with a very helpful sommelier. We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional.

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized.

Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal.

November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"

An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning.

August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Unbelievable food and an incredible skills and service !,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"
September 2023,"Innovative, creative & beautiful food with incredible atmosphere & service","Myself, my partner and my friend enjoyed an incredible 9 course meal at Launceston Place in September and we were blown away with the skills Ben Murphy has and what he created for us. 

The restaurant has a lovely friendly atmosphere and the service was...second to none. 

The flavours and presentation in Ben‚Äôs cooking were just incredible. An extremely talented chef and we cannot wait to go back again soon!

October 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"
September 2023,A must go,"An amazing food experience with an excellent selection of wine, totally destroyed by rude and unpleasant service (except the sommelier ).

August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,"We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet.

September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet.

August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu.

We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"

So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.

This turned out to be a great choice - the food was superb in both presentation & flavour & the service excellent. There was...a good wine list with a very helpful sommelier. We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"
September 2023,Unbelievable food and an incredible skills and service !,"Myself, my partner and my friend enjoyed an incredible 9 course meal at Launceston Place in September and we were blown away with the skills Ben Murphy has and what he created for us.

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"

August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive.

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless.

November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"
September 2023,Unbelievable food and an incredible skills and service !,"Myself, my partner and my friend enjoyed an incredible 9 course meal at Launceston Place in September and we were blown away with the skills Ben Murphy has and what he created for us. 

The restaurant has a lovely friendly atmosphere and the service was...second to none. 

The flavours and presentation in Ben‚Äôs cooking were just incredible. An extremely talented chef and we cannot wait to go back again soon!

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"
September 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"An amazing food experience with an excellent selection of wine, totally destroyed by rude and unpleasant service (except the sommelier ).

September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious.

August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet.

November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely!

Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"
September 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"An amazing food experience with an excellent selection of wine, totally destroyed by rude and unpleasant service (except the sommelier ).

September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet. 

Would we return....no. Would we recommend...noMore"
August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu.

We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy.

August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"

So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet.

August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu. This turned out to be a great choice - the food was superb in both presentation & flavour & the service excellent. There was...a good wine list with a very helpful sommelier. We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"

An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning.

August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet.

Please go to Launceston Place, you will not be disappointed! We had the chefs tasting menu with wine pairing - I highly recommend this choice :)

I have been telling all of my friends & family about how incredible this place is, nestled in a village in the middle of Kensington. We will be back - thank you so much to the hugely talented head chef Ben and his wonderful team.

October 2023,Exceptional lunch!,"Exceptional lunch! Food excellent. Service professional, attentive and super friendly! Food is always perfect at Launceston Place - never disappoints! See you soon! Kevin and Richard"
October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"
September 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"An amazing food experience with an excellent selection of wine, totally destroyed by rude and unpleasant service (except the sommelier ). Top restaurants need to ensure that they get everything right. Overall I am unable to recommend this restaurant, but if you are a foodie...and go with the expectation of poor service, then it will be worth it for the food and wine.More"
September 2023,A must go,"A wonderful evening where food, service ans interior embraced each other - a Michelin star is due! A place to enjoy !!"
September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet. 

Would we return....no. Would we recommend...noMore"
August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu. This turned out to be a great choice - the food was superb in both presentation & flavour & the service excellent. There was...a good wine list with a very helpful sommelier. We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"

So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet. 

Would we return....no. Would we recommend...noMore"
August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu. This turned out to be a great choice - the food was superb in both presentation & flavour & the service excellent. There was...a good wine list with a very helpful sommelier. We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal.

July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal.

An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning.

August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless.

November 2023,"Innovative, creative & beautiful food with incredible atmosphere & service","One of my favourite meals of all time. This restaurant has such incredible elegance, class, warmth, energy - the list goes on!

Please go to Launceston Place, you will not be disappointed! We had the chefs tasting menu with wine pairing - I highly recommend this choice :)

October 2023,Exceptional lunch!,"Exceptional lunch! Food excellent. Service professional, attentive and super friendly! Food is always perfect at Launceston Place - never disappoints! See you soon! Kevin and Richard"
October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"
September 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"An amazing food experience with an excellent selection of wine, totally destroyed by rude and unpleasant service (except the sommelier ).

September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet. 

Would we return....no. Would we recommend...noMore"
August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu.

We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy.

August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"

September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning.

August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet.

August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu.

We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy.

August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"

So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.

August 2023,Great dining experience,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Fabulous experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Unbelievable food and an incredible skills and service !,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal.

August 2023,Outstanding,"We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless.

November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"
November 2023,Unbelievable food and an incredible skills and service !,"Myself, my partner and my friend enjoyed an incredible 9 course meal at Launceston Place in September and we were blown away with the skills Ben Murphy has and what he created for us.

The flavours and presentation in Ben‚Äôs cooking were just incredible. An extremely talented chef and we cannot wait to go back again soon!

Please go to Launceston Place, you will not be disappointed! We had the chefs tasting menu with wine pairing - I highly recommend this choice :)

I have been telling all of my friends & family about how incredible this place is, nestled in a village in the middle of Kensington. We will be back - thank you so much to the hugely talented head chef Ben and his wonderful team.

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"
October 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"An amazing food experience with an excellent selection of wine, totally destroyed by rude and unpleasant service (except the sommelier ).

September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
September 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet. 

Would we return....no. Would we recommend...noMore"
August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu.

We will definitely return.More
August 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy.

July 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"

November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal.

August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless.

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet.

August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu. This turned out to be a great choice - the food was superb in both presentation & flavour & the service excellent. There was...a good wine list with a very helpful sommelier. We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"

August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless.

Please go to Launceston Place, you will not be disappointed! We had the chefs tasting menu with wine pairing - I highly recommend this choice :)

I have been telling all of my friends & family about how incredible this place is, nestled in a village in the middle of Kensington. We will be back - thank you so much to the hugely talented head chef Ben and his wonderful team.

October 2023,Exceptional lunch!,"Exceptional lunch! Food excellent. Service professional, attentive and super friendly! Food is always perfect at Launceston Place - never disappoints! See you soon! Kevin and Richard"
October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"
September 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"An amazing food experience with an excellent selection of wine, totally destroyed by rude and unpleasant service (except the sommelier ). Top restaurants need to ensure that they get everything right. Overall I am unable to recommend this restaurant, but if you are a foodie...and go with the expectation of poor service, then it will be worth it for the food and wine.More"
September 2023,A must go,"A wonderful evening where food, service ans interior embraced each other - a Michelin star is due! A place to enjoy !!"
September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet. 

Would we return....no. Would we recommend...noMore"
August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu. This turned out to be a great choice - the food was superb in both presentation & flavour & the service excellent. There was...a good wine list with a very helpful sommelier. We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"

So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet. 

Would we return....no. Would we recommend...noMore"
August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu.

We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"

So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet.

August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu.

This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy.

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal.

November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

November 2023,"Innovative, creative & beautiful food with incredible atmosphere & service","One of my favourite meals of all time. This restaurant has such incredible elegance, class, warmth, energy - the list goes on!

Please go to Launceston Place, you will not be disappointed! We had the chefs tasting menu with wine pairing - I highly recommend this choice :)

October 2023,Exceptional lunch!,"Exceptional lunch! Food excellent. Service professional, attentive and super friendly! Food is always perfect at Launceston Place - never disappoints! See you soon! Kevin and Richard"
October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"
September 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"An amazing food experience with an excellent selection of wine, totally destroyed by rude and unpleasant service (except the sommelier ).

September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet. 

Would we return....no. Would we recommend...noMore"
August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu.

We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy.

August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"

September 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"An amazing food experience with an excellent selection of wine, totally destroyed by rude and unpleasant service (except the sommelier ).

September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet.

August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu.

We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"

So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.

This turned out to be a great choice - the food was superb in both presentation & flavour & the service excellent. There was...a good wine list with a very helpful sommelier. We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"
September 2023,Unbelievable food and an incredible skills and service !,"Myself, my partner and my friend enjoyed an incredible 9 course meal at Launceston Place in September and we were blown away with the skills Ben Murphy has and what he created for us.

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"

August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive.

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless.

November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"
September 2023,Unbelievable food and an incredible skills and service !,"Myself, my partner and my friend enjoyed an incredible 9 course meal at Launceston Place in September and we were blown away with the skills Ben Murphy has and what he created for us. 

The restaurant has a lovely friendly atmosphere and the service was...second to none. 

The flavours and presentation in Ben‚Äôs cooking were just incredible. An extremely talented chef and we cannot wait to go back again soon!

Ben your extremely posh cheese toastie was SUPERB!More"
November 2023,"Innovative, creative & beautiful food with incredible atmosphere & service","One of my favourite meals of all time. This restaurant has such incredible elegance, class, warmth, energy - the list goes on!
The food was beautiful, creative & set our taste buds on fire!!

The staff were simply wonderful and couldn‚Äôt have been friendlier. They...were informative & funny and made our meal very enjoyable üòç

Please go to Launceston Place, you will not be disappointed! We had the chefs tasting menu with wine pairing - I highly recommend this choice :)

I have been telling all of my friends & family about how incredible this place is, nestled in a village in the middle of Kensington. We will be back - thank you so much to the hugely talented head chef Ben and his wonderful team.

October 2023,Exceptional lunch!,"Exceptional lunch! Food excellent. Service professional, attentive and super friendly! Food is always perfect at Launceston Place - never disappoints! See you soon! Kevin and Richard"
October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"
September 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"An amazing food experience with an excellent selection of wine, totally destroyed by rude and unpleasant service (except the sommelier ).

September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet. 

Would we return....no. Would we recommend...noMore"
August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu. This turned out to be a great choice - the food was superb in both presentation & flavour & the service excellent. There was...a good wine list with a very helpful sommelier. We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"
September 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"An amazing food experience with an excellent selection of wine, totally destroyed by rude and unpleasant service (except the sommelier ).

September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet. 

Would we return....no. Would we recommend...noMore"
August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu.

We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy.

August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"

So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet.

August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu. This turned out to be a great choice - the food was superb in both presentation & flavour & the service excellent. There was...a good wine list with a very helpful sommelier. We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"

An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning.

August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet.

Please go to Launceston Place, you will not be disappointed! We had the chefs tasting menu with wine pairing - I highly recommend this choice :)

I have been telling all of my friends & family about how incredible this place is, nestled in a village in the middle of Kensington. We will be back - thank you so much to the hugely talented head chef Ben and his wonderful team.

October 2023,Exceptional lunch!,"Exceptional lunch! Food excellent. Service professional, attentive and super friendly! Food is always perfect at Launceston Place - never disappoints! See you soon! Kevin and Richard"
October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"
September 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"An amazing food experience with an excellent selection of wine, totally destroyed by rude and unpleasant service (except the sommelier ). Top restaurants need to ensure that they get everything right. Overall I am unable to recommend this restaurant, but if you are a foodie...and go with the expectation of poor service, then it will be worth it for the food and wine.More"
September 2023,A must go,"A wonderful evening where food, service ans interior embraced each other - a Michelin star is due! A place to enjoy !!"
September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet. 

Would we return....no. Would we recommend...noMore"
August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu. This turned out to be a great choice - the food was superb in both presentation & flavour & the service excellent. There was...a good wine list with a very helpful sommelier. We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"

So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Unbelievable food and an incredible skills and service !,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"

September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless.

November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal.

An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning.

August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive.

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless.

The flavours and presentation in Ben‚Äôs cooking were just incredible. An extremely talented chef and we cannot wait to go back again soon!

November 2023,"Innovative, creative & beautiful food with incredible atmosphere & service","One of my favourite meals of all time. This restaurant has such incredible elegance, class, warmth, energy - the list goes on!

Please go to Launceston Place, you will not be disappointed! We had the chefs tasting menu with wine pairing - I highly recommend this choice :)

October 2023,Exceptional lunch!,"Exceptional lunch! Food excellent. Service professional, attentive and super friendly! Food is always perfect at Launceston Place - never disappoints! See you soon! Kevin and Richard"
October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"
September 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"An amazing food experience with an excellent selection of wine, totally destroyed by rude and unpleasant service (except the sommelier ).

September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet. 

Would we return....no. Would we recommend...noMore"
August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu.

We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy.

August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"

September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet.

August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu.

We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"

So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!

August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu.

We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal.

August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu.

November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"
September 2023,Oh dear‚Ä¶,"An amazing food experience with an excellent selection of wine, totally destroyed by rude and unpleasant service (except the sommelier ).

September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet. 

Would we return....no. Would we recommend...noMore"
August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu.

We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy.

November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely!

September 2023,Superb set lunch in a great setting ,"We were recommended this by family and it seems they really know their stuff. An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning. The set lunch included a glass of Pink...Lanson Champagne which provided perfect match to the food. The pre-starters were superb and who would have though tomato steam water could be so delicious. Deserts were stunning. Will we be back ....... we certainly will.More"
August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet.

August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu.

This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy.

November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet.

August 2023,Great choice for a special occasion,We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read favourable reviews & also tempted by the very reasonable set menu. This turned out to be a great choice - the food was superb in both presentation & flavour & the service excellent. There was...a good wine list with a very helpful sommelier. We will definitely return.More
July 2023,Outstanding,"We discovered this place browsing through the Virgin Experience dining options, and opted to come here for lunch. This was unequivocally the best value meal we have ever had in our lives. The quality and presentation of the dishes is Michelin star-worthy. The service is...spot-on and the decor is pleasant and there is not an air of pretentiousness, despite its elite postcode. We will look to come back for the tasting menu!More"
August 2023,Lovely set lunch,"We went with friends (their first time) for the summer set lunch which was lovely and started with some pink champagne (included in the price) and first-class canapes the 3-course meal was excellent as was the service, great value for cooking of this standard, well...worth a visit.More"
July 2023,Great dining experience,"Great restaurant: elegant ambiance, very professional and nice staff, haut cuisine food. Interesting gimmick for the menu. Not cheap, but not surprising given the level."
November 2023,Fabulous experience,"What a fabulous place. Amazing food, beautifully presented with a unique concept of menu selection. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
November 2023,Truly Excellent and value for money too!,"A few days ago I had a meal in a (Fullers) pub. Main course, beer and coffee, it came to just over ¬£30.

Today I had lunch at Launceston Place, bread, amuse Bouche, an extra course, starter, main course, desert, two drinks (champagne and Chablis)...and coffee. It came to just over ¬£100.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal.

So the question is ‚Äòis Launceston Place‚Äô worth just over three time the price of a one course meal in a pub?‚Äô. Well the answer is a very clear Absolutely! The service was far, far better, the decor was much nicer and the food was so much better you‚Äôd hardly believe it, out of this world better.

Now I know not everyone can afford a ¬£100 lunch, but given the choice between a pie and pint  three times or one trip to Launceston place you‚Äôd be mad not to give up the beer for something really excellent at least once!

Go on! Launceston Place is really worth it!More"
November 2023,Amazing Tasting Menu - Must Visit,"I took my mum to have dinner at Launceston Place Friday evening and we were extremely impressed.  The tasting menu is creative and the quality and detail of the food is unbelievable.  The presentation of the food is immaculate and can really tell a lot...of effort goes into each dish.  So many good flavours and textures, the food is like no other.  The wine is lovely, the staff are very informative, friendly and polite.  They really know what they are serving their customers!  Soft lighting, peaceful music, has a soothing pleasant ambience.  Highly recommend for any occasion, especially if you can really appreciate food.  Fine dining at its best and Ben Murphy deserves a Michelin star for all his efforts.More"
September 2023,Unbelievable food and an incredible skills and service !,"Myself, my partner and my friend enjoyed an incredible 9 course meal at Launceston Place in September and we were blown away with the skills Ben Murphy has and what he created for us.

October 2023,"Beautifully balanced, delicate flavours end a great sense of well-being","Launceston Place very quickly creates a sense of ease, welcome and well-being. Staff are very impressive - warm, interested and meticulously professional. An excellent and widely diverse wine list is expertly supported by the very knowledgeable and engaging sommelier and both waiting and management staff...added warmth and enjoyment to truly excellent service. 

The menu, while not extensive, was extremely well chosen to delight and interest the diner and to accommodate particular needs. Each dish, following on from the two superb amuse bouche offerings, was delicious, superbly presented and very appropriately sized. Throughout, subtle, delicate, innovative and delightful flavours characterised every dish. Having chosen a superb veal cheek as our main course, and decided on beaujolais to accompany it, the sommelier‚Äôs choice of which beaujolais, delivered an outstanding pairing, most particularly with the veal. 

The food, wine, service and ambience of Launceston Place combined to deliver us a truly superb and very appropriately priced evening‚Äôs dining experience.  We will be returning.More"

An exceptional lunch, great atmosphere and very pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and professional staff. The food was imaginative and interesting and presentation was stunning.

August 2023,"Would not return, would not recommend","We attended this restaurant for dinner last night. 

Things that was excellent...

The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The wine list was vast

Things that were ok....

The wine, we ordered a bottle of sancerre as its my favorite wine. The waiter informed...us that it was not chilled so while we waited, they offered us a glass of fizz. When the wine was served, it was still only slightly chilled so we had to ask for ice. 

Things we didn't enjoy...

The food - didn't enjoy the menu 1 bit, the taster menu was odd! The pigeon wellington was only slightly warm, the fat was not rendered on the pigeon and the pastry case was soggy. There needs to be more description on the menu. 
The daughts idea for the menu seems slightly pointless. 

The environment was very very minimalistic, it felt cold and empty. The restaurant was extremely quiet.
