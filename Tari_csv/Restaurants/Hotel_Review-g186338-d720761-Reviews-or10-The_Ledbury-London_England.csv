October 2023,Sensational - even when Gluten-Free!,"I’ve reviewed this restaurant several times before and eaten here far more times than I’ve reviewed it but this was my first visit since very recently having to adopt a gluten-free diet. The dazzling quality of both cooking and service here are almost a “given”...(despite a few dishes this time perhaps surpassing anything previously enjoyed!) so it’s the GF aspect that I wanted to focus on this time.

Firstly, I felt at all times that it was being taken entirely seriously (eg where necessary, my GF items were kept rigorously separate from the regular ones). Secondly, at the relatively few points in the meal where a modification of the menu was needed, I never felt that I was missing out or making do with second best. The oven-hot GF oat-based rolls were quite wonderful and a couple of my “specials” struck me as even nicer that the regular item was likely to have been! As a newcomer to this world of allergens, it is truly impossible to ask for more!!More"

The food is superb , creative and perfectly executed but what makes this such a special dining experience is the waiting staff. In...addition to being efficient and helpful they are charming , informative and friendly which makes the evening informal and in our case lively and relaxed which very much suited us 4 . A special mention to Josh and Luca who were fabulous and as I’m sure with all diners made us feel special , nothing was too much trouble and we really appreciated their attention and personality. Thank you to all the staff who treated us as if we were regulars (which we aren’t)  from walking in to leaving -it made for a wonderful highly recommended dining experienceMore"
October 2023,Better than ever 👏,"Whenever I come to the UK an essential part of my trip is a visit toThe Ledbury
Being greeted by so many of the staff who remember me even after the Covid years is very special as is the personal greeting and welcome from Brett....I’ve been coming to The Ledbury since day one.  Tonight’s experience was exceptional.
What a joy not to look at a menus but to simply be served and endless arrayed spectacular dishes all of which are a taste sensation.
The wine list is an enormous tome!  Easy to buy anything you desire but also to get a good wine at a very reasonable price.
The staff, the attention to detail, the personal involvement of Brest mean that the evening works seamlessly.  A true testament to Brett’s vision and leadership
We’ll done all, we’ll done Brett and a big thank you

August 2023,Stunning!!!,"Came for my 40th birthday with friends, and wow. Wow wow wow. It’s my fifth visit(my 30th and 35th bday included), and it just gets better every time. The food, the staff, the ambience, genuinely as good as it gets. The 9 or 10 course...tasting menu started with a birthday card on the table, and ended with a birthday dessert treat! I felt so special, and looked after. Each dish was perfection and beautiful, and the wine tasting was possibly the best matched I’ve had in a restaurant for the value. I’ll keep it short and sweet as I could wax lyrical for the next 10,000 words, but all I can say is The Ledbury really is the real deal. Beautiful, stunning restaurant, so glad it came back(and I keep coming back!!)More"
August 2023,Fabulous 50th fun,"I chose The Ledbury to celebrate my 50th birthday (in the evening of the big day) with my husband and it did not disappoint!

Being a two Michelin star establishment you hope (even though it's not a given) that the food is going to be...amazing - and it was. But there are other people who are better talking about that.

Beyond the food and wine, my choice of venue for my special evening was influenced by the vibe I got from the website - understated - backed up by the fact there was no dress code. Although we did make an effort to look smart it just felt a bit more relaxed that there was no overriding expectation to look a certain way. It made for a chilled out evening.

The staff there are excellent, certainly in our case I felt they get the measure of your personality and respond accordingly. I was in the mood for fun and they obliged - there were plenty of laughs amongst all the top-notch dining.

Sometimes I can get caught up in a moment and forget to notice all the little things. This time, contemplating my 50th, I was in the mood to be observant and appreciate all those extra little touches. Yes, there were a lot of staff but service was unobtrusive and they moved gracefully and with purpose. It put me in mind of The Ledbury: The Musical - surely it has to happen :) the choreography was brilliantly executed and beautiful to behold! The textures of the food were complemented by the different crockery and cutlery which were great supporting actors in the show.

It was an unforgettable celebration of a big milestone - thanks to everyone there for the part they played.More"
August 2023,Wow what a comeback!,"Wow what a comeback!! Brett and his staff have truly outdone themselves. We went for my birthday with friends. I am gluten intolerant and catered for my needs all the way through, even changing pjs of the dishes on the day. The restaurant is stunning!...The food is just incredible. Not cheap but you get what you pay for.

Great relaxed atmosphere, loved the decor, the staff were exceptional, the tasting menu ( lunch ) was pretty amazing. My only gripe is that dessert can be too hefty lunch time, i really enjoyed them but perhaps even...with a tasting menu perhaps give the option of some cheese or to skip it, the three of us could have shared one dessert. We had the wine pairings which were exceptional although it was too white heavy for one guestMore"
July 2023,"So Glad It’s Back, Has it’s Michelin 2* Again and is as TASTY as ever!","With always creative Chef Brett Graham at the helm and General Manager Jack Settle running the front of house one expects and gets nothing less than culinary and service perfection. I was saddened when I learned The Ledbury had closed for good but more than...pleasantly surprised when it reopened last year. I’ve always enjoyed the Ledbury and so I made sure to book early. Despite an initial issue with my reservation upon arrival, the team fixed it and I was seated for a 3 hour culinary adventure. Nothing about the Ledbury disappointed. Fresh, creative, impressively plated, and super tasty dishes arrived in a well orchestrated symphony. (Special thanks to server Josh; professional and personable.)  

Each course was entirely delicious and would take some time to explain so I’ll leave that to the accompanying photos. A BIG thanks to each member of the kitchen staff. The warm hen’s egg with truffle, the lamb and of course both desserts were true standouts, as were a he accompanying wine selections.

This is the first Michelin restaurant over the past decade I’ve been to 3 times now. Each time sets the stage for a future visit-it’s that good.

WELL done Team Ledbury!!!!!!!!!More"

October 2023,Sensational - even when Gluten-Free!,"I’ve reviewed this restaurant several times before and eaten here far more times than I’ve reviewed it but this was my first visit since very recently having to adopt a gluten-free diet. The dazzling quality of both cooking and service here are almost a “given”...(despite a few dishes this time perhaps surpassing anything previously enjoyed!) so it’s the GF aspect that I wanted to focus on this time.

Firstly, I felt at all times that it was being taken entirely seriously (eg where necessary, my GF items were kept rigorously separate from the regular ones). Secondly, at the relatively few points in the meal where a modification of the menu was needed, I never felt that I was missing out or making do with second best. The oven-hot GF oat-based rolls were quite wonderful and a couple of my “specials” struck me as even nicer that the regular item was likely to have been!

I felt so special, and looked after. Each dish was perfection and beautiful, and the wine tasting was possibly the best matched I’ve had in a restaurant for the value.

August 2023,Fabulous 50th fun,"I chose The Ledbury to celebrate my 50th birthday (in the evening of the big day) with my husband and it did not disappoint!

Being a two Michelin star establishment you hope (even though it's not a given) that the food is going to be...amazing - and it was. But there are other people who are better talking about that.

Beyond the food and wine, my choice of venue for my special evening was influenced by the vibe I got from the website - understated - backed up by the fact there was no dress code. Although we did make an effort to look smart it just felt a bit more relaxed that there was no overriding expectation to look a certain way. It made for a chilled out evening.

The staff there are excellent, certainly in our case I felt they get the measure of your personality and respond accordingly. I was in the mood for fun and they obliged - there were plenty of laughs amongst all the top-notch dining.

Sometimes I can get caught up in a moment and forget to notice all the little things. This time, contemplating my 50th, I was in the mood to be observant and appreciate all those extra little touches. Yes, there were a lot of staff but service was unobtrusive and they moved gracefully and with purpose. It put me in mind of The Ledbury: The Musical - surely it has to happen :) the choreography was brilliantly executed and beautiful to behold! The textures of the food were complemented by the different crockery and cutlery which were great supporting actors in the show.

It was an unforgettable celebration of a big milestone - thanks to everyone there for the part they played.More"

July 2023,"So Glad It’s Back, Has it’s Michelin 2* Again and is as TASTY as ever!","With always creative Chef Brett Graham at the helm and General Manager Jack Settle running the front of house one expects and gets nothing less than culinary and service perfection. I was saddened when I learned The Ledbury had closed for good but more than...pleasantly surprised when it reopened last year. I’ve always enjoyed the Ledbury and so I made sure to book early. Despite an initial issue with my reservation upon arrival, the team fixed it and I was seated for a 3 hour culinary adventure. Nothing about the Ledbury disappointed. Fresh, creative, impressively plated, and super tasty dishes arrived in a well orchestrated symphony. (Special thanks to server Josh; professional and personable.)  

Each course was entirely delicious and would take some time to explain so I’ll leave that to the accompanying photos. A BIG thanks to each member of the kitchen staff. The warm hen’s egg with truffle, the lamb and of course both desserts were true standouts, as were a he accompanying wine selections.

This is the first Michelin restaurant over the past decade I’ve been to 3 times now. Each time sets the stage for a future visit-it’s that good.

August 2023,Stunning!!!,"Came for my 40th birthday with friends, and wow. Wow wow wow. It’s my fifth visit(my 30th and 35th bday included), and it just gets better every time. The food, the staff, the ambience, genuinely as good as it gets. The 9 or 10 course...tasting menu started with a birthday card on the table, and ended with a birthday dessert treat!

August 2023,Fabulous 50th fun,"I chose The Ledbury to celebrate my 50th birthday (in the evening of the big day) with my husband and it did not disappoint!

Being a two Michelin star establishment you hope (even though it's not a given) that the food is going to be...amazing - and it was. But there are other people who are better talking about that.

Beyond the food and wine, my choice of venue for my special evening was influenced by the vibe I got from the website - understated - backed up by the fact there was no dress code. Although we did make an effort to look smart it just felt a bit more relaxed that there was no overriding expectation to look a certain way. It made for a chilled out evening.

The staff there are excellent, certainly in our case I felt they get the measure of your personality and respond accordingly. I was in the mood for fun and they obliged - there were plenty of laughs amongst all the top-notch dining.

Sometimes I can get caught up in a moment and forget to notice all the little things. This time, contemplating my 50th, I was in the mood to be observant and appreciate all those extra little touches. Yes, there were a lot of staff but service was unobtrusive and they moved gracefully and with purpose. It put me in mind of The Ledbury: The Musical - surely it has to happen :) the choreography was brilliantly executed and beautiful to behold! The textures of the food were complemented by the different crockery and cutlery which were great supporting actors in the show.

It was an unforgettable celebration of a big milestone - thanks to everyone there for the part they played.More"
August 2023,Wow what a comeback!,"Wow what a comeback!! Brett and his staff have truly outdone themselves. We went for my birthday with friends.

July 2023,"So Glad It’s Back, Has it’s Michelin 2* Again and is as TASTY as ever!","With always creative Chef Brett Graham at the helm and General Manager Jack Settle running the front of house one expects and gets nothing less than culinary and service perfection. I was saddened when I learned The Ledbury had closed for good but more than...pleasantly surprised when it reopened last year. I’ve always enjoyed the Ledbury and so I made sure to book early. Despite an initial issue with my reservation upon arrival, the team fixed it and I was seated for a 3 hour culinary adventure. Nothing about the Ledbury disappointed. Fresh, creative, impressively plated, and super tasty dishes arrived in a well orchestrated symphony. (Special thanks to server Josh; professional and personable.)  

Each course was entirely delicious and would take some time to explain so I’ll leave that to the accompanying photos. A BIG thanks to each member of the kitchen staff. The warm hen’s egg with truffle, the lamb and of course both desserts were true standouts, as were a he accompanying wine selections.

October 2023,Sensational - even when Gluten-Free!,"I’ve reviewed this restaurant several times before and eaten here far more times than I’ve reviewed it but this was my first visit since very recently having to adopt a gluten-free diet. The dazzling quality of both cooking and service here are almost a “given”...(despite a few dishes this time perhaps surpassing anything previously enjoyed!) so it’s the GF aspect that I wanted to focus on this time.

Firstly, I felt at all times that it was being taken entirely seriously (eg where necessary, my GF items were kept rigorously separate from the regular ones). Secondly, at the relatively few points in the meal where a modification of the menu was needed, I never felt that I was missing out or making do with second best. The oven-hot GF oat-based rolls were quite wonderful and a couple of my “specials” struck me as even nicer that the regular item was likely to have been! As a newcomer to this world of allergens, it is truly impossible to ask for more!!More"

What a joy not to look at a menus but to simply be served and endless arrayed spectacular dishes all of which are a taste sensation.
The wine list is an enormous tome!  Easy to buy anything you desire but also to get a good wine at a very reasonable price.
The staff, the attention to detail, the personal involvement of Brest mean that the evening works seamlessly.  A true testament to Brett’s vision and leadership

May 2023,30th Anniversary - Best Meal Ever,"This was the best meal we have ever had. 

Beautiful, fresh, imaginative food. So many delicious flavours, textures and creations in the tasting menu.

The service was impeccable. The staff were a cut above - knowledgeable in detail about every course and with a great...sense of humour to put us at ease.

The interior was beautiful and added to the ambience of the whole event. 

It was an amazing experience, we would definitely go back for a special occasion. Well done all, amazing. XxMore"
May 2023,What a treat to be back again! ,"So happy to be back in London after the long pandemic hiatus! Part of the joy was dining at one of my very favorite restaurants in the city. Thankfully they graciously allowed me to dine by myself as my husband wasn’t able to join this...time.  I love everything about this place - amazing, beautiful food, lovely atmosphere and the kindest, most generous staff. Just love!More"
October 2023,Sensational - even when Gluten-Free!,"I’ve reviewed this restaurant several times before and eaten here far more times than I’ve reviewed it but this was my first visit since very recently having to adopt a gluten-free diet. The dazzling quality of both cooking and service here are almost a “given”...(despite a few dishes this time perhaps surpassing anything previously enjoyed!) so it’s the GF aspect that I wanted to focus on this time.

Firstly, I felt at all times that it was being taken entirely seriously (eg where necessary, my GF items were kept rigorously separate from the regular ones). Secondly, at the relatively few points in the meal where a modification of the menu was needed, I never felt that I was missing out or making do with second best. The oven-hot GF oat-based rolls were quite wonderful and a couple of my “specials” struck me as even nicer that the regular item was likely to have been! As a newcomer to this world of allergens, it is truly impossible to ask for more!!More"

October 2023,Better than ever 👏,"Whenever I come to the UK an essential part of my trip is a visit toThe Ledbury
Being greeted by so many of the staff who remember me even after the Covid years is very special as is the personal greeting and welcome from Brett....I’ve been coming to The Ledbury since day one.  Tonight’s experience was exceptional.
What a joy not to look at a menus but to simply be served and endless arrayed spectacular dishes all of which are a taste sensation.
The wine list is an enormous tome!  Easy to buy anything you desire but also to get a good wine at a very reasonable price.
The staff, the attention to detail, the personal involvement of Brest mean that the evening works seamlessly.  A true testament to Brett’s vision and leadership

August 2023,Fabulous 50th fun,"I chose The Ledbury to celebrate my 50th birthday (in the evening of the big day) with my husband and it did not disappoint!

Being a two Michelin star establishment you hope (even though it's not a given) that the food is going to be...amazing - and it was. But there are other people who are better talking about that.

Beyond the food and wine, my choice of venue for my special evening was influenced by the vibe I got from the website - understated - backed up by the fact there was no dress code. Although we did make an effort to look smart it just felt a bit more relaxed that there was no overriding expectation to look a certain way. It made for a chilled out evening.

The staff there are excellent, certainly in our case I felt they get the measure of your personality and respond accordingly. I was in the mood for fun and they obliged - there were plenty of laughs amongst all the top-notch dining.

Sometimes I can get caught up in a moment and forget to notice all the little things. This time, contemplating my 50th, I was in the mood to be observant and appreciate all those extra little touches. Yes, there were a lot of staff but service was unobtrusive and they moved gracefully and with purpose. It put me in mind of The Ledbury: The Musical - surely it has to happen :) the choreography was brilliantly executed and beautiful to behold! The textures of the food were complemented by the different crockery and cutlery which were great supporting actors in the show.

It was an unforgettable celebration of a big milestone - thanks to everyone there for the part they played.More"

July 2023,"So Glad It’s Back, Has it’s Michelin 2* Again and is as TASTY as ever!","With always creative Chef Brett Graham at the helm and General Manager Jack Settle running the front of house one expects and gets nothing less than culinary and service perfection. I was saddened when I learned The Ledbury had closed for good but more than...pleasantly surprised when it reopened last year. I’ve always enjoyed the Ledbury and so I made sure to book early. Despite an initial issue with my reservation upon arrival, the team fixed it and I was seated for a 3 hour culinary adventure. Nothing about the Ledbury disappointed. Fresh, creative, impressively plated, and super tasty dishes arrived in a well orchestrated symphony. (Special thanks to server Josh; professional and personable.)

The food, the staff, the ambience, genuinely as good as it gets. The 9 or 10 course...tasting menu started with a birthday card on the table, and ended with a birthday dessert treat!

August 2023,Fabulous 50th fun,"I chose The Ledbury to celebrate my 50th birthday (in the evening of the big day) with my husband and it did not disappoint!

Being a two Michelin star establishment you hope (even though it's not a given) that the food is going to be...amazing - and it was. But there are other people who are better talking about that.

Beyond the food and wine, my choice of venue for my special evening was influenced by the vibe I got from the website - understated - backed up by the fact there was no dress code. Although we did make an effort to look smart it just felt a bit more relaxed that there was no overriding expectation to look a certain way. It made for a chilled out evening.

The staff there are excellent, certainly in our case I felt they get the measure of your personality and respond accordingly. I was in the mood for fun and they obliged - there were plenty of laughs amongst all the top-notch dining.

Sometimes I can get caught up in a moment and forget to notice all the little things. This time, contemplating my 50th, I was in the mood to be observant and appreciate all those extra little touches. Yes, there were a lot of staff but service was unobtrusive and they moved gracefully and with purpose. It put me in mind of The Ledbury: The Musical - surely it has to happen :) the choreography was brilliantly executed and beautiful to behold! The textures of the food were complemented by the different crockery and cutlery which were great supporting actors in the show.

It was an unforgettable celebration of a big milestone - thanks to everyone there for the part they played.More"
August 2023,Wow what a comeback!,"Wow what a comeback!! Brett and his staff have truly outdone themselves. We went for my birthday with friends.

July 2023,"So Glad It’s Back, Has it’s Michelin 2* Again and is as TASTY as ever!","With always creative Chef Brett Graham at the helm and General Manager Jack Settle running the front of house one expects and gets nothing less than culinary and service perfection. I was saddened when I learned The Ledbury had closed for good but more than...pleasantly surprised when it reopened last year. I’ve always enjoyed the Ledbury and so I made sure to book early. Despite an initial issue with my reservation upon arrival, the team fixed it and I was seated for a 3 hour culinary adventure. Nothing about the Ledbury disappointed. Fresh, creative, impressively plated, and super tasty dishes arrived in a well orchestrated symphony. (Special thanks to server Josh; professional and personable.)  

Each course was entirely delicious and would take some time to explain so I’ll leave that to the accompanying photos. A BIG thanks to each member of the kitchen staff. The warm hen’s egg with truffle, the lamb and of course both desserts were true standouts, as were a he accompanying wine selections.

October 2023,Sensational - even when Gluten-Free!,"I’ve reviewed this restaurant several times before and eaten here far more times than I’ve reviewed it but this was my first visit since very recently having to adopt a gluten-free diet. The dazzling quality of both cooking and service here are almost a “given”...(despite a few dishes this time perhaps surpassing anything previously enjoyed!) so it’s the GF aspect that I wanted to focus on this time.

Firstly, I felt at all times that it was being taken entirely seriously (eg where necessary, my GF items were kept rigorously separate from the regular ones). Secondly, at the relatively few points in the meal where a modification of the menu was needed, I never felt that I was missing out or making do with second best. The oven-hot GF oat-based rolls were quite wonderful and a couple of my “specials” struck me as even nicer that the regular item was likely to have been!

What a joy not to look at a menus but to simply be served and endless arrayed spectacular dishes all of which are a taste sensation.
The wine list is an enormous tome!  Easy to buy anything you desire but also to get a good wine at a very reasonable price.

I felt so special, and looked after. Each dish was perfection and beautiful, and the wine tasting was possibly the best matched I’ve had in a restaurant for the value.

August 2023,Fabulous 50th fun,"I chose The Ledbury to celebrate my 50th birthday (in the evening of the big day) with my husband and it did not disappoint!

Being a two Michelin star establishment you hope (even though it's not a given) that the food is going to be...amazing - and it was. But there are other people who are better talking about that.

Beyond the food and wine, my choice of venue for my special evening was influenced by the vibe I got from the website - understated - backed up by the fact there was no dress code. Although we did make an effort to look smart it just felt a bit more relaxed that there was no overriding expectation to look a certain way. It made for a chilled out evening.

The staff there are excellent, certainly in our case I felt they get the measure of your personality and respond accordingly. I was in the mood for fun and they obliged - there were plenty of laughs amongst all the top-notch dining.

Sometimes I can get caught up in a moment and forget to notice all the little things. This time, contemplating my 50th, I was in the mood to be observant and appreciate all those extra little touches. Yes, there were a lot of staff but service was unobtrusive and they moved gracefully and with purpose. It put me in mind of The Ledbury: The Musical - surely it has to happen :) the choreography was brilliantly executed and beautiful to behold! The textures of the food were complemented by the different crockery and cutlery which were great supporting actors in the show.

It was an unforgettable celebration of a big milestone - thanks to everyone there for the part they played.More"

July 2023,"So Glad It’s Back, Has it’s Michelin 2* Again and is as TASTY as ever!","With always creative Chef Brett Graham at the helm and General Manager Jack Settle running the front of house one expects and gets nothing less than culinary and service perfection. I was saddened when I learned The Ledbury had closed for good but more than...pleasantly surprised when it reopened last year. I’ve always enjoyed the Ledbury and so I made sure to book early. Despite an initial issue with my reservation upon arrival, the team fixed it and I was seated for a 3 hour culinary adventure. Nothing about the Ledbury disappointed. Fresh, creative, impressively plated, and super tasty dishes arrived in a well orchestrated symphony. (Special thanks to server Josh; professional and personable.)  

Each course was entirely delicious and would take some time to explain so I’ll leave that to the accompanying photos. A BIG thanks to each member of the kitchen staff. The warm hen’s egg with truffle, the lamb and of course both desserts were true standouts, as were a he accompanying wine selections.

Being a two Michelin star establishment you hope (even though it's not a given) that the food is going to be...amazing - and it was. But there are other people who are better talking about that.

Beyond the food and wine, my choice of venue for my special evening was influenced by the vibe I got from the website - understated - backed up by the fact there was no dress code. Although we did make an effort to look smart it just felt a bit more relaxed that there was no overriding expectation to look a certain way. It made for a chilled out evening.

The staff there are excellent, certainly in our case I felt they get the measure of your personality and respond accordingly. I was in the mood for fun and they obliged - there were plenty of laughs amongst all the top-notch dining.

Sometimes I can get caught up in a moment and forget to notice all the little things. This time, contemplating my 50th, I was in the mood to be observant and appreciate all those extra little touches. Yes, there were a lot of staff but service was unobtrusive and they moved gracefully and with purpose. It put me in mind of The Ledbury: The Musical - surely it has to happen :) the choreography was brilliantly executed and beautiful to behold! The textures of the food were complemented by the different crockery and cutlery which were great supporting actors in the show.

It was an unforgettable celebration of a big milestone - thanks to everyone there for the part they played.More"
August 2023,Wow what a comeback!,"Wow what a comeback!! Brett and his staff have truly outdone themselves. We went for my birthday with friends.

Not cheap but you get what you pay for.

Great relaxed atmosphere, loved the decor, the staff were exceptional, the tasting menu ( lunch ) was pretty amazing.

July 2023,"So Glad It’s Back, Has it’s Michelin 2* Again and is as TASTY as ever!","With always creative Chef Brett Graham at the helm and General Manager Jack Settle running the front of house one expects and gets nothing less than culinary and service perfection. I was saddened when I learned The Ledbury had closed for good but more than...pleasantly surprised when it reopened last year. I’ve always enjoyed the Ledbury and so I made sure to book early. Despite an initial issue with my reservation upon arrival, the team fixed it and I was seated for a 3 hour culinary adventure. Nothing about the Ledbury disappointed. Fresh, creative, impressively plated, and super tasty dishes arrived in a well orchestrated symphony. (Special thanks to server Josh; professional and personable.)  

Each course was entirely delicious and would take some time to explain so I’ll leave that to the accompanying photos. A BIG thanks to each member of the kitchen staff. The warm hen’s egg with truffle, the lamb and of course both desserts were true standouts, as were a he accompanying wine selections.

This is the first Michelin restaurant over the past decade I’ve been to 3 times now. Each time sets the stage for a future visit-it’s that good.

WELL done Team Ledbury!!!!!!!!!More"

October 2023,Sensational - even when Gluten-Free!,"I’ve reviewed this restaurant several times before and eaten here far more times than I’ve reviewed it but this was my first visit since very recently having to adopt a gluten-free diet. The dazzling quality of both cooking and service here are almost a “given”...(despite a few dishes this time perhaps surpassing anything previously enjoyed!) so it’s the GF aspect that I wanted to focus on this time.

Firstly, I felt at all times that it was being taken entirely seriously (eg where necessary, my GF items were kept rigorously separate from the regular ones). Secondly, at the relatively few points in the meal where a modification of the menu was needed, I never felt that I was missing out or making do with second best. The oven-hot GF oat-based rolls were quite wonderful and a couple of my “specials” struck me as even nicer that the regular item was likely to have been! As a newcomer to this world of allergens, it is truly impossible to ask for more!!More"

October 2023,Better than ever 👏,"Whenever I come to the UK an essential part of my trip is a visit toThe Ledbury
Being greeted by so many of the staff who remember me even after the Covid years is very special as is the personal greeting and welcome from Brett....I’ve been coming to The Ledbury since day one.  Tonight’s experience was exceptional.
What a joy not to look at a menus but to simply be served and endless arrayed spectacular dishes all of which are a taste sensation.
The wine list is an enormous tome!  Easy to buy anything you desire but also to get a good wine at a very reasonable price.
The staff, the attention to detail, the personal involvement of Brest mean that the evening works seamlessly.  A true testament to Brett’s vision and leadership

Secondly, at the relatively few points in the meal where a modification of the menu was needed, I never felt that I was missing out or making do with second best.

October 2023,My partner and I had a fantastic multi course meal in a beautiful setting with exceptional wait staff. ,"Amazing food, wonderful wait staff an incredible experience!!!

October 2023,Better than ever 👏,"Whenever I come to the UK an essential part of my trip is a visit toThe Ledbury
Being greeted by so many of the staff who remember me even after the Covid years is very special as is the personal greeting and welcome from Brett....I’ve been coming to The Ledbury since day one.  Tonight’s experience was exceptional.
What a joy not to look at a menus but to simply be served and endless arrayed spectacular dishes all of which are a taste sensation.
The wine list is an enormous tome!  Easy to buy anything you desire but also to get a good wine at a very reasonable price.
The staff, the attention to detail, the personal involvement of Brest mean that the evening works seamlessly.  A true testament to Brett’s vision and leadership

August 2023,Fabulous 50th fun,"I chose The Ledbury to celebrate my 50th birthday (in the evening of the big day) with my husband and it did not disappoint!

Being a two Michelin star establishment you hope (even though it's not a given) that the food is going to be...amazing - and it was. But there are other people who are better talking about that.

Beyond the food and wine, my choice of venue for my special evening was influenced by the vibe I got from the website - understated - backed up by the fact there was no dress code. Although we did make an effort to look smart it just felt a bit more relaxed that there was no overriding expectation to look a certain way. It made for a chilled out evening.

The staff there are excellent, certainly in our case I felt they get the measure of your personality and respond accordingly. I was in the mood for fun and they obliged - there were plenty of laughs amongst all the top-notch dining.

Sometimes I can get caught up in a moment and forget to notice all the little things. This time, contemplating my 50th, I was in the mood to be observant and appreciate all those extra little touches. Yes, there were a lot of staff but service was unobtrusive and they moved gracefully and with purpose. It put me in mind of The Ledbury: The Musical - surely it has to happen :) the choreography was brilliantly executed and beautiful to behold! The textures of the food were complemented by the different crockery and cutlery which were great supporting actors in the show.

It was an unforgettable celebration of a big milestone - thanks to everyone there for the part they played.More"

July 2023,"So Glad It’s Back, Has it’s Michelin 2* Again and is as TASTY as ever!","With always creative Chef Brett Graham at the helm and General Manager Jack Settle running the front of house one expects and gets nothing less than culinary and service perfection. I was saddened when I learned The Ledbury had closed for good but more than...pleasantly surprised when it reopened last year. I’ve always enjoyed the Ledbury and so I made sure to book early. Despite an initial issue with my reservation upon arrival, the team fixed it and I was seated for a 3 hour culinary adventure. Nothing about the Ledbury disappointed. Fresh, creative, impressively plated, and super tasty dishes arrived in a well orchestrated symphony. (Special thanks to server Josh; professional and personable.)  

Each course was entirely delicious and would take some time to explain so I’ll leave that to the accompanying photos. A BIG thanks to each member of the kitchen staff. The warm hen’s egg with truffle, the lamb and of course both desserts were true standouts, as were a he accompanying wine selections.

The staff there are excellent, certainly in our case I felt they get the measure of your personality and respond accordingly. I was in the mood for fun and they obliged - there were plenty of laughs amongst all the top-notch dining.

Sometimes I can get caught up in a moment and forget to notice all the little things. This time, contemplating my 50th, I was in the mood to be observant and appreciate all those extra little touches. Yes, there were a lot of staff but service was unobtrusive and they moved gracefully and with purpose. It put me in mind of The Ledbury: The Musical - surely it has to happen :) the choreography was brilliantly executed and beautiful to behold! The textures of the food were complemented by the different crockery and cutlery which were great supporting actors in the show.

It was an unforgettable celebration of a big milestone - thanks to everyone there for the part they played.More"
August 2023,Wow what a comeback!,"Wow what a comeback!! Brett and his staff have truly outdone themselves. We went for my birthday with friends.

July 2023,"So Glad It’s Back, Has it’s Michelin 2* Again and is as TASTY as ever!","With always creative Chef Brett Graham at the helm and General Manager Jack Settle running the front of house one expects and gets nothing less than culinary and service perfection. I was saddened when I learned The Ledbury had closed for good but more than...pleasantly surprised when it reopened last year. I’ve always enjoyed the Ledbury and so I made sure to book early. Despite an initial issue with my reservation upon arrival, the team fixed it and I was seated for a 3 hour culinary adventure. Nothing about the Ledbury disappointed. Fresh, creative, impressively plated, and super tasty dishes arrived in a well orchestrated symphony. (Special thanks to server Josh; professional and personable.)  

Each course was entirely delicious and would take some time to explain so I’ll leave that to the accompanying photos. A BIG thanks to each member of the kitchen staff. The warm hen’s egg with truffle, the lamb and of course both desserts were true standouts, as were a he accompanying wine selections.

This is the first Michelin restaurant over the past decade I’ve been to 3 times now. Each time sets the stage for a future visit-it’s that good.

October 2023,Sensational - even when Gluten-Free!,"I’ve reviewed this restaurant several times before and eaten here far more times than I’ve reviewed it but this was my first visit since very recently having to adopt a gluten-free diet. The dazzling quality of both cooking and service here are almost a “given”...(despite a few dishes this time perhaps surpassing anything previously enjoyed!) so it’s the GF aspect that I wanted to focus on this time.

Firstly, I felt at all times that it was being taken entirely seriously (eg where necessary, my GF items were kept rigorously separate from the regular ones). Secondly, at the relatively few points in the meal where a modification of the menu was needed, I never felt that I was missing out or making do with second best. The oven-hot GF oat-based rolls were quite wonderful and a couple of my “specials” struck me as even nicer that the regular item was likely to have been! As a newcomer to this world of allergens, it is truly impossible to ask for more!!More"

October 2023,Better than ever 👏,"Whenever I come to the UK an essential part of my trip is a visit toThe Ledbury

What a joy not to look at a menus but to simply be served and endless arrayed spectacular dishes all of which are a taste sensation.
The wine list is an enormous tome!  Easy to buy anything you desire but also to get a good wine at a very reasonable price.
The staff, the attention to detail, the personal involvement of Brest mean that the evening works seamlessly.  A true testament to Brett’s vision and leadership

May 2023,My partner and I had a fantastic multi course meal in a beautiful setting with exceptional wait staff. ,"Amazing food, wonderful wait staff an incredible experience!!!
Our visit to London was made even more special with this dining wonder. The attention to detail was impeccable."
October 2023,Definitely worth the treat,"Not somewhere you would choose for a quick snack but as a special night out the restaurant lived up to expectation .  The food is superb , creative and perfectly executed but what makes this such a special dining experience is the waiting staff. In...addition to being efficient and helpful they are charming , informative and friendly which makes the evening informal and in our case lively and relaxed which very much suited us 4 . A special mention to Josh and Luca who were fabulous and as I’m sure with all diners made us feel special , nothing was too much trouble and we really appreciated their attention and personality. Thank you to all the staff who treated us as if we were regulars (which we aren’t)  from walking in to leaving -it made for a wonderful highly recommended dining experienceMore"
October 2023,Better than ever 👏,"Whenever I come to the UK an essential part of my trip is a visit toThe Ledbury
Being greeted by so many of the staff who remember me even after the Covid years is very special as is the personal greeting and welcome from Brett....I’ve been coming to The Ledbury since day one.  Tonight’s experience was exceptional.
What a joy not to look at a menus but to simply be served and endless arrayed spectacular dishes all of which are a taste sensation.
The wine list is an enormous tome!  Easy to buy anything you desire but also to get a good wine at a very reasonable price.
The staff, the attention to detail, the personal involvement of Brest mean that the evening works seamlessly.  A true testament to Brett’s vision and leadership
We’ll done all, we’ll done Brett and a big thank you
Here’s to June 2024! 🍷🇦🇺More"
September 2023,Excellent anniversary dinner,First time back in 4 years. Glad they reopened.  Menu post Covid was different but still top notch. Thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience. Thanks.
August 2023,Fabulous ,"Went here for my 60th birthday with hubby daughter and partner as part of my celebrations . Well the whole experience was amazing !! Food was excellent along with the excellent wine pairing. The staff were friendly and helpful which added to the whole experience,...This has to be one of the best restaurants in London & can’t wait to return, Thankyou Ledbury for a fantastic evening .More"
September 2023,Absolutely top London restaurant,"Went for my wife’s birthday, absolutely outstanding meal . We are lucky to eat all over the world in great restaurants. This is right up there with the very best . Outstanding course was the turbot . However what made it extra special was the...staff . They were all very friendly and professional.  Do not hesitate to book a table here .More"
August 2023,Stunning!!!,"Came for my 40th birthday with friends, and wow. Wow wow wow. It’s my fifth visit(my 30th and 35th bday included), and it just gets better every time. The food, the staff, the ambience, genuinely as good as it gets. The 9 or 10 course...tasting menu started with a birthday card on the table, and ended with a birthday dessert treat! I felt so special, and looked after. Each dish was perfection and beautiful, and the wine tasting was possibly the best matched I’ve had in a restaurant for the value. I’ll keep it short and sweet as I could wax lyrical for the next 10,000 words, but all I can say is The Ledbury really is the real deal. Beautiful, stunning restaurant, so glad it came back(and I keep coming back!!)More"
August 2023,Fabulous 50th fun,"I chose The Ledbury to celebrate my 50th birthday (in the evening of the big day) with my husband and it did not disappoint!

Being a two Michelin star establishment you hope (even though it's not a given) that the food is going to be...amazing - and it was. But there are other people who are better talking about that.

Beyond the food and wine, my choice of venue for my special evening was influenced by the vibe I got from the website - understated - backed up by the fact there was no dress code. Although we did make an effort to look smart it just felt a bit more relaxed that there was no overriding expectation to look a certain way. It made for a chilled out evening.

The staff there are excellent, certainly in our case I felt they get the measure of your personality and respond accordingly. I was in the mood for fun and they obliged - there were plenty of laughs amongst all the top-notch dining.

Sometimes I can get caught up in a moment and forget to notice all the little things. This time, contemplating my 50th, I was in the mood to be observant and appreciate all those extra little touches. Yes, there were a lot of staff but service was unobtrusive and they moved gracefully and with purpose. It put me in mind of The Ledbury: The Musical - surely it has to happen :) the choreography was brilliantly executed and beautiful to behold! The textures of the food were complemented by the different crockery and cutlery which were great supporting actors in the show.

It was an unforgettable celebration of a big milestone - thanks to everyone there for the part they played.More"
August 2023,Wow what a comeback!,"Wow what a comeback!! Brett and his staff have truly outdone themselves. We went for my birthday with friends. I am gluten intolerant and catered for my needs all the way through, even changing pjs of the dishes on the day. The restaurant is stunning!...The food is just incredible. Not cheap but you get what you pay for.
Thank you to all the staff we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!More"
July 2023,A lengthy feast ,"Friendly staff and good food, but I a multi-course set-menu. Would prefer a quality three course meal plus carpet to absorb the background noise."
August 2023,Glad to revisit after it briefly,"Glad to revisit after it briefly closed. Great relaxed atmosphere, loved the decor, the staff were exceptional, the tasting menu ( lunch ) was pretty amazing. My only gripe is that dessert can be too hefty lunch time, i really enjoyed them but perhaps even...with a tasting menu perhaps give the option of some cheese or to skip it, the three of us could have shared one dessert. We had the wine pairings which were exceptional although it was too white heavy for one guestMore"
July 2023,"So Glad It’s Back, Has it’s Michelin 2* Again and is as TASTY as ever!","With always creative Chef Brett Graham at the helm and General Manager Jack Settle running the front of house one expects and gets nothing less than culinary and service perfection. I was saddened when I learned The Ledbury had closed for good but more than...pleasantly surprised when it reopened last year. I’ve always enjoyed the Ledbury and so I made sure to book early. Despite an initial issue with my reservation upon arrival, the team fixed it and I was seated for a 3 hour culinary adventure. Nothing about the Ledbury disappointed. Fresh, creative, impressively plated, and super tasty dishes arrived in a well orchestrated symphony. (Special thanks to server Josh; professional and personable.)  

Each course was entirely delicious and would take some time to explain so I’ll leave that to the accompanying photos. A BIG thanks to each member of the kitchen staff. The warm hen’s egg with truffle, the lamb and of course both desserts were true standouts, as were a he accompanying wine selections.

This is the first Michelin restaurant over the past decade I’ve been to 3 times now. Each time sets the stage for a future visit-it’s that good.

WELL done Team Ledbury!!!!!!!!!More"
May 2023,30th Anniversary - Best Meal Ever,"This was the best meal we have ever had. 

Beautiful, fresh, imaginative food. So many delicious flavours, textures and creations in the tasting menu.

The service was impeccable. The staff were a cut above - knowledgeable in detail about every course and with a great...sense of humour to put us at ease.

The interior was beautiful and added to the ambience of the whole event. 

It was an amazing experience, we would definitely go back for a special occasion. Well done all, amazing. XxMore"
May 2023,What a treat to be back again! ,"So happy to be back in London after the long pandemic hiatus! Part of the joy was dining at one of my very favorite restaurants in the city. Thankfully they graciously allowed me to dine by myself as my husband wasn’t able to join this...time.  I love everything about this place - amazing, beautiful food, lovely atmosphere and the kindest, most generous staff. Just love!More"
