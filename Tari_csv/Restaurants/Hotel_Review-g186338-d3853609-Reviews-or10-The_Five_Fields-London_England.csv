October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

From the first bite, you're taken on a culinary journey of exquisite...taste. Each plate is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds, with vibrant colors and careful presentation adding to the dining experience.

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"

October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience.

July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!!

June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"

In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish.

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"

Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses.

We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"

In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.

March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche.

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"

April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

From the first bite, you're taken on a culinary journey of exquisite...taste. Each plate is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds, with vibrant colors and careful presentation adding to the dining experience.

The menu at The Five Fields is a celebration of fine dining at its best. Every dish is a testament to the creativity and skill of the chefs, who bring together diverse ingredients to create harmonious and delicious masterpieces.

With its consistent excellence and attention to detail, The Five Fields rightfully earns a 5-star rating. If you're seeking a dining experience in London that is both visually stunning and tantalizingly tasty, The Five Fields is a perfect choice.More"
June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"

October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"

October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"

September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -

June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,Delightful in every way,"I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Exemplary,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,Excellent,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

With its consistent excellence and attention to detail, The Five Fields rightfully earns a 5-star rating. If you're seeking a dining experience in London that is both visually stunning and tantalizingly tasty, The Five Fields is a perfect choice.More"
June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food.

A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"

Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed.

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"

Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

From the first bite, you're taken on a culinary journey of exquisite...taste. Each plate is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds, with vibrant colors and careful presentation adding to the dining experience.

The menu at The Five Fields is a celebration of fine dining at its best. Every dish is a testament to the creativity and skill of the chefs, who bring together diverse ingredients to create harmonious and delicious masterpieces.

With its consistent excellence and attention to detail, The Five Fields rightfully earns a 5-star rating. If you're seeking a dining experience in London that is both visually stunning and tantalizingly tasty, The Five Fields is a perfect choice.More"
June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"

April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

From the first bite, you're taken on a culinary journey of exquisite...taste. Each plate is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds, with vibrant colors and careful presentation adding to the dining experience.

The menu at The Five Fields is a celebration of fine dining at its best. Every dish is a testament to the creativity and skill of the chefs, who bring together diverse ingredients to create harmonious and delicious masterpieces.

With its consistent excellence and attention to detail, The Five Fields rightfully earns a 5-star rating. If you're seeking a dining experience in London that is both visually stunning and tantalizingly tasty, The Five Fields is a perfect choice.More"

March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

From the first bite, you're taken on a culinary journey of exquisite...taste. Each plate is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds, with vibrant colors and careful presentation adding to the dining experience.

The menu at The Five Fields is a celebration of fine dining at its best. Every dish is a testament to the creativity and skill of the chefs, who bring together diverse ingredients to create harmonious and delicious masterpieces.

With its consistent excellence and attention to detail, The Five Fields rightfully earns a 5-star rating. If you're seeking a dining experience in London that is both visually stunning and tantalizingly tasty, The Five Fields is a perfect choice.More"
June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
October 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
April 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
March 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"

September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

From the first bite, you're taken on a culinary journey of exquisite...taste. Each plate is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds, with vibrant colors and careful presentation adding to the dining experience.

The menu at The Five Fields is a celebration of fine dining at its best. Every dish is a testament to the creativity and skill of the chefs, who bring together diverse ingredients to create harmonious and delicious masterpieces.

With its consistent excellence and attention to detail, The Five Fields rightfully earns a 5-star rating. If you're seeking a dining experience in London that is both visually stunning and tantalizingly tasty, The Five Fields is a perfect choice.More"
June 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"

June 2023,Delightful in every way,"I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"

Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"

A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.

Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"

A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"

December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed.

The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

From the first bite, you're taken on a culinary journey of exquisite...taste. Each plate is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds, with vibrant colors and careful presentation adding to the dining experience.

The menu at The Five Fields is a celebration of fine dining at its best. Every dish is a testament to the creativity and skill of the chefs, who bring together diverse ingredients to create harmonious and delicious masterpieces.

Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!!

The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

From the first bite, you're taken on a culinary journey of exquisite...taste. Each plate is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds, with vibrant colors and careful presentation adding to the dining experience.

The menu at The Five Fields is a celebration of fine dining at its best. Every dish is a testament to the creativity and skill of the chefs, who bring together diverse ingredients to create harmonious and delicious masterpieces.

With its consistent excellence and attention to detail, The Five Fields rightfully earns a 5-star rating. If you're seeking a dining experience in London that is both visually stunning and tantalizingly tasty, The Five Fields is a perfect choice.More"
June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"

April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"

Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"

May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

From the first bite, you're taken on a culinary journey of exquisite...taste. Each plate is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds, with vibrant colors and careful presentation adding to the dining experience.

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!!

September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

From the first bite, you're taken on a culinary journey of exquisite...taste. Each plate is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds, with vibrant colors and careful presentation adding to the dining experience.

The menu at The Five Fields is a celebration of fine dining at its best. Every dish is a testament to the creativity and skill of the chefs, who bring together diverse ingredients to create harmonious and delicious masterpieces.

With its consistent excellence and attention to detail, The Five Fields rightfully earns a 5-star rating. If you're seeking a dining experience in London that is both visually stunning and tantalizingly tasty, The Five Fields is a perfect choice.More"
June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent.

A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"

Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"

April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

With its consistent excellence and attention to detail, The Five Fields rightfully earns a 5-star rating. If you're seeking a dining experience in London that is both visually stunning and tantalizingly tasty, The Five Fields is a perfect choice.More"
June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche.

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"

A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"

September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"

Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed.

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

From the first bite, you're taken on a culinary journey of exquisite...taste. Each plate is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds, with vibrant colors and careful presentation adding to the dining experience.

The menu at The Five Fields is a celebration of fine dining at its best. Every dish is a testament to the creativity and skill of the chefs, who bring together diverse ingredients to create harmonious and delicious masterpieces.

With its consistent excellence and attention to detail, The Five Fields rightfully earns a 5-star rating. If you're seeking a dining experience in London that is both visually stunning and tantalizingly tasty, The Five Fields is a perfect choice.More"
June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"

April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action.

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

From the first bite, you're taken on a culinary journey of exquisite...taste. Each plate is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds, with vibrant colors and careful presentation adding to the dining experience.

The menu at The Five Fields is a celebration of fine dining at its best. Every dish is a testament to the creativity and skill of the chefs, who bring together diverse ingredients to create harmonious and delicious masterpieces.

With its consistent excellence and attention to detail, The Five Fields rightfully earns a 5-star rating. If you're seeking a dining experience in London that is both visually stunning and tantalizingly tasty, The Five Fields is a perfect choice.More"

I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table.

We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche.

May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

From the first bite, you're taken on a culinary journey of exquisite...taste. Each plate is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds, with vibrant colors and careful presentation adding to the dining experience.

The menu at The Five Fields is a celebration of fine dining at its best. Every dish is a testament to the creativity and skill of the chefs, who bring together diverse ingredients to create harmonious and delicious masterpieces.

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!!

Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"
July 2023,A Culinary Symphony at The Five Fields,"The Five Fields restaurant in London is a treasure trove for the palate. The food isn't just prepared, it's crafted - every dish is a perfect composition of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

From the first bite, you're taken on a culinary journey of exquisite...taste. Each plate is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds, with vibrant colors and careful presentation adding to the dining experience.

The menu at The Five Fields is a celebration of fine dining at its best. Every dish is a testament to the creativity and skill of the chefs, who bring together diverse ingredients to create harmonious and delicious masterpieces.

With its consistent excellence and attention to detail, The Five Fields rightfully earns a 5-star rating. If you're seeking a dining experience in London that is both visually stunning and tantalizingly tasty, The Five Fields is a perfect choice.More"
June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting.

The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms.

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"

April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
February 2023,Excellent,"We visited here for a lunch and I must say the whole experience was outstanding.  The welcome, the service, the food, and even the price were all spot on.   The ambience the place offers at lunch time, I can only imagine would be tenfold in...the evening.  It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"

September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

It was my wife's second visit, and my first, and I can say we will be back but this time to try the evening.More"
December 2022,Best fine dining of our week in London!,"We loved every moment of our special occasion dinner at Five Fields!  The restaurant is small, quiet, and serene.  The staff are polished and refreshingly Unobtrusive - each course of our prixe fixe menu arrived in perfect unison but with none of the pretentious “fanfare”...many other expensive restaurants choose to display.

Most important, of course, the food is fabulous, inventive, and gorgeous.  Standouts on the night we dined were the potato course and the later fallow deer offering.  We chose the less expensive wine pairing (£105) - excellent and we appreciated sommelier Nuno’s gracious, comprehensive explanations of each choice.

Definitely will return when we’re ready for another Very Posh dinner!More"
October 2023,Outstanding Dining Experience,"Throughout the last seven years that I’ve been writing restaurant reviews there have been times when your simply blown away by the hospitality industry. Our lunch at The Five Fields on saturday was quite simply one of those occasions. This fabulous restaurant treated us to...a dining experience that will be remembered for a very long time. I stated about a year ago that this place had become an absolute favourite of ours. This has now been enhanced even more after our latest visit.

Our amazing afternoon began as soon as we walked through the door with a lovely welcome from Sandra and Nuno before Miriam escorted us to our table. Once settled we we given a complimentary glass of champagne while we looked at the menu. They only serve a tasting menu for lunch but as usual it all looked very inviting. We began with a delightful selection of snacks consisting of Salmon , Leek Tart , Cheese and Onion Tartelette and a Velvet Crab consommé.

At this point sommelier Nuno came over to discuss what wine we’d like to have. He gave us a few options but in the end went for the one he seemed most passionate about. This was a Goliardo Tintos de Mar Rias Baixas from Spain a delightfully light and fruity red wine that complemented the menu perfectly. Before our first course we were in for a fantastic surprise as we headed downstairs to meet Chef Marguerite and the team. It was amazing to have a chat with them and to see them in action. We then headed back to the dining room to begin the afternoon’s festivities.

Our first course was the Celeriac with poached oyster and pine. Along with this came a little surprise of a celeriac salad. We then moved on to the Carrot with a seared and dried scallop. This came with a scallop tartare along with a carrot and scallop roe escabeche. 

Onto the next next course which was a fantastic touch from the team as Marguerite sent us up an extra dish of Lobster with beetroot and rose that was absolutely stunning and accompanied with a lobster claw and green herbs side dish. A big hug from us was sent back to the kitchen. We then moved on to the Dover Sole confit with courgette which was heaven on a plate. Before moving to the main course there was another amazing surprise from the kitchen as they presented us with the Grouse with offal and girolles that simply left us on cloud nine. 

Now we could move to the main course and another fabulous dish. This was the short loin of Lamb with red peppers and rosemary. Next to come was a delightful and refreshing palate cleanser of  Plum preserved plum sorbet with seaweed. Before our dessert it was good to see Michaela again who has returned to the restaurant as a sommelier. She asked if we’d like a sweet wine to pair with the Apple Tart with camomile and creme fraiche. She recommended a 2014 Greek Vinsanto from the Estate Argyros in Santorini with its light raisin notes paired amazingly with the apple. 

We finished with a coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a most amazing dining experience. The food was simply exceptional , the service was impeccable as always and the wine pairings were amazing. I really can’t recommend a visit to The Five Fields highly enough because if you haven’t been you are really missing out. This quite simply was hospitality at its finest and I cannot wait to walk back through their doors again.

Thank You to Marguerite , Meg , Danny and Luca in the kitchen , Sandra and Miriam for their excellent friendly service and to Nuno and Michaela for fabulous wine pairings. We absolutely look forward to seeing you all again soon.More"
May 2023,Excellent service and delicious food!,"Very amazing place, great service, great food , good vibe. An elegant small and cosy fine dining restaurant, definitely a Michelin Star experience. Gave 1 star less because the portions of food could be bigger, was still a but hungry after the tasting menu courses."
September 2023,Absolutely top class fine dining experience,Exceptional cooking - imaginative combinations faultlessly executed with superb ingredients - definitely had a 2-3mich star feel- the service was attentive but not intrusive and the tables are nicely separated (which is v rare these days) -
July 2023,Flavourful and delicious dishes without the fuss,"Excellent food. The original ingredients are given great importance and many dishes will allow the ingredient to be seen in their original forms. Flavours were very pleasant and many dishes were very memorable, such as the carrot and scallop dish and wild strawberry dessert.

The...dining room was slightly too dark for my preference but the service was pretty good. This is another restaurant that seems to have been underrated by Michelin - hopefully a second star will arrive soon……More"

June 2023,Fantastic anniversary meal,"Came here on Saturday for our anniversary. Restaurant is lovely atmosphere is great, not too loud not too quiet and the waitresses and waiters were brilliant. Definitely one of the best I’ve ever been to and I have to say the presentation of the dishes...was probably the best I’ve ever seen. Also the restaurant made us a copy of the menu to take home as a memento of our anniversary this was a lovely touch made it feel very personal and have never had a restaurant do this before so thank you very much!! We will try to make it back some day. Highly highly recommend if your into fine diningMore"
June 2023,"I mean, like “wow”","I have set as one of my life-goals to introduce my nephew to the finer things in life. The project is going well, and he has already progressed to taking his lovely wife to proper restaurants around Europe, to sample tasting menus.

But even if...I could step back and say my work is done, I won’t. At least, I won’t while The Five Fields is open!

The third trip for Mrs Reviewer and I. Our 25th anniversary - and the nephew’s first. Any other excuses needed? No.

I mean, wow. No words work to describe the experience.

Just go there. It’s the best.More"
April 2023,Delightful in every way,Absolutely faultless. This was far better than Le Gavroche. Really incredible service and presentation. I was delighted that the food wasn’t too heavy which meant we could enjoy every course.
April 2023,A Michelin Star wow!!,"This Michelin Star restaurant is located in the heart of Chelsea. Linda picked this restaurant for her birthday because of past reviews of the tasting menu. Small, beautiful, intimate dining space and a very attentive wait staff. This restaurant surpassed all of our expectations with...its very creative menu. Typically tasting menus serve single items in each course. Five Fields serves two to three very creative variations within several of their courses. A few of the standout courses were the Kohlrabi (a vegetable) served three unique ways, the lobster tail, the Dover Sole, Morels, and Fallow Deer.  We opted for the cheese course instead of dessert. The premium wine pairings was well worth the upcharge. A lovely, romantic evening in celebration of my beautiful wife’s birthday!More"
March 2023,Would be Good at a Third of the Cost,Lovely food but I’ve had meals and experiences just as good for a third of the cost. Rather disappointing.
April 2023,Exemplary,"For the last five years we have been meeting with friends and eating out every three months at Michelin level restaurants.
In my opinion this was the best we have eaten at.
We knew from the canapés that we were in for a treat.
Then...the combination of hot and cold versions of the main ingredient in the initial courses of the tasting menu were just so full of flavour.  My favourite was the warm asparagus.
The star of the cheese course was pine cones!!!!

Our sommelier was superb with extremely detailed descriptions and very vibrant and complimentary pairings.

Overall a fantastic tasting meal - thank you The Five FieldsMore"
March 2023,One of the best restaurants in London,"One of the best in London

Easily one of the best restaurants in London. Everything is sublime. The food is perfect, beautifully presented and cooked. The service is too. Nice, quiet atmosphere. Great wine list. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and...it never fails to impress.More"
March 2023,An excellent tasting menu experience.,"This was a double celebration and was truly memorable.we took our own wine and paid corkage and the food was excellent. Although it was a tasting menu, which I don’t normally favour this was a good, hearty dinner. Three starters (effectively) all vegetable based including...a divine carrot dish. A lobster dish, a scallop dish which made a lovely fish course, while everyone else had fallow deer, I had a wonderful short rib. The meal was rounded off with a quince mousse and a rhubarb tartlet.

The room is pleasant but not opulent and the service was knowledgeable and friendly.More"
