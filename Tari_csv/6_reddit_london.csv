1,"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 12:59:37 PM GMT+1","If he is ex-Airforce I can recommend two or three things - 1. The air force museum in Hendon however if you can get to Duxford there are 4 hangers there as well as out door exhibits (the American hanger is especially interesting). Of course the IWM and the Science museum also have some aviation stuff.

Alternatively if he has never seen it, the Battle of Britain memorial on the Embankment is interesting and only a quick trip."

6,"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 3:32:44 PM GMT+1","You could go to Greenwich on the U(ber)-boat and then go to the Observatory or the Maritime Museum and eat at Goddards Pie and Mash for some unfussy, very traditional, very affordable British food.

There's some good pubs by the Thames too."

8,"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 4:15:58 PM GMT+1","If you can find a Daniel Jeanrenaud gig, take him.

He's a guitarist and he plays the old rock and roll numbers, and he is an electric performer. I once saw him play a kebab shop in Camden at 1am (they were licenced) - no-one was there to see music, but he grabbed your attention, commanded the room, absolutely smashed the granny out of the set, and had the crowd screaming for more. Never seen anything like it. Pure rock and roll."

If he's a history buff he might enjoy seeing Operation Mincemeat - it's a brilliant musical and (almost unbelievably) based on a true story.
13,"Friday, August 18, 2023 at 5:00:29 PM GMT+1","That's 3 for operation mincemeat so definitely a winner! Blues bar sounds great, he's not going to be able to stand long so I'll see if we can get in early."

A dude called Lee drives you around in a minivan for half a day taking you to places you've mostly been past before, but he has so much music knowledge to impart and is so utterly amazed by it all you can't help but enjoy it.

We went to Abbey Road, where Get Back was filmed, overlooking Battersea talking about Pink Floyd and more. I believe you can also send him specific bands you're interested in to get it more tailored."

How about an escape room to do together? Or one of the board game cafes that have popped up - there's one in Dalston that also serves craft beers etc, so could fulfill the pub vibe too?

I second all the recommendations that have been made for the Imperial War Museum (IWM), the Air Force Museum in Hendon, and Duxford, and would add HMS Belfast and the Cabinet War Rooms - I found them all fascinating, and I'd imagine that with an RAF background, they would be even more so.

And definitely try and get tickets for Operation Mincemeat - I took my mum, who is the same age as your dad, and she adored it."

But as a heads up Oppenheimer has some pretty raunchy full frontal sex scenes, just in case that influences your decision to see it with your dad! It is a very good film though. If movies are his thing you could see what's on at the prince Charles cinema and see if they've got any good old films on"

Its really lowkey, the play good old timer music, have pub quiz on wednesday and people of all ages go :P And right down the road from that is the Charles Dickens museum if he is into that too. Oh and right there is also where George Orewell lived, too."
25,"Wednesday, August 16, 2023 at 11:51:24 AM GMT+1","There are loads of walking tours of London that are cheap and really informative. Even as someone who has lived here for years I’ve been placed and learnt things I had no idea of.

There are lots of general operators who are good, but there are also specialist pub tours (for older people!), music tours your dad would probably love and meet like minded people at. There may even be ones that are focused on military history too, I just don’t know about them.

The warehouse buildings in the market have been nicely regenerated and it’s a lovely space to walk round but fuck me the retail offer is so poor. Literally every unit is selling either the same t-shirts or bad art prints, that’s it. It could badly do with a bit of variety. But then again what do I know, I’m not the target audience."

250,"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 11:15:23 AM GMT+1","This is a valid question, even pre-Covid. If you're ""socially solitary"" (meaning single and some combination of new to London, a natural introvert, or in a period of enforced social distancing), London can be a surprisingly hard city in which to find interesting things to do that don't involve eating or drinking, especially if you're on a budget. Yes, there are a lot of cool free/cheap museums and cemeteries, but I find these to be more of a once-per-month activity. It's hard to be excited about your n+1st museum that you've seen this month alone, especially if you've got no one with whom to discuss the interesting things you saw.

In the end, the answer always seems to come back to walking around London, going somewhere else (even more expensive and difficult now!), or trying to synthesize yourself into some social group, but I can say I have lived in a lot of cities on a lot of continents and London is the most cliquish city I have ever experienced. So, it's hard.

When I first arrived in London, I walked hundreds of miles to explore and entertain myself, but, like you, I hit a point where I just didn't want to walk anymore. I had walked all the streets within a three-mile radius of my flat so many times that to walk to somewhere new I almost needed to take the Tube, which sort of defeats the point. I started looking for tasks to take me to some more distant place in Zone 5 or 6 and I would walk back to my flat in Zone 1 from there. Those were good, memorable days that had a nice combination of accomplishment and exploration, but there's only so many tasks you can find to give you reason to travel from Zone 1 to more remotes parts of London.

I joined the Tate as a member for a couple of years which wasn't cheap but I found very rewarding. I never get tired of taking the boat between the two Tates and I also value spontaneity--being able to see special exhibits any time I wanted was worth a lot to me. Unfortunately, I think Covid has killed what's left of the non-booking-and-queueing part of London life. Boats are still fun though.

In the summers, I started doing things outdoors that you normally associate with mundane indoor tasks. I would take my laptop to the park and use my phone as a hotspot and answer boring emails but do so in nice weather. Or just read a book. Sometimes I fed the ducks at parks which I found surprisingly soul-restorative.

One summer, I moved all my stuff into storage and stayed week-to-week in different parts London. That was exhausting but fascinating! London, being the amalgamation of little villages, is perfectly suited for that--every part of the metro area has a unique history and nature. I really enjoyed getting a (figurative) taste of each. I think this might be logistically impossible now in the Covid era though.

Anyway, I'm empathetic to your issue. My best advice is to find a curiosity that gets you out of the flat, maybe taking a language class, researching family records, taking a skills course (like a sport or CPR/First Aid), learning about the architecture of the city, just anything where you're curious, you will be in for mentally stimulating, low-calorie entertainment and not the usual ""dressed up pirates mix you cocktails"" fare."
251,"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 11:55:58 AM GMT+1","Do you have some examples of these tasks set in the outer zones you’d do?

Seems like you figured out London though I’m impressed, I had the same feelings as you at times."

I’m lazy enough that it wasn’t always easy to convince myself I needed to go that far for something I could probably just order online.
253,"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 12:33:56 PM GMT+1","yes the enjoyment from walking around the city greatly depends on where you live

From where I live I can walk to Hampstead Heath, Primrose Hill, Regent's Park, Hyde Park, Marylebone, Camden town, Portobello Market, the canal all within an hour. And I can even borden my destination by taking a short ride on the overground (live near the overground station)

So I'm pretty satisfied with my life so far even I moved to London a year ago during lockdown!

But I totally understand this is because I've chosen a great location to live, plus I just love walking around the city, even before I moved to London!"
254,"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 5:10:53 PM GMT+1","New to London and absolutely love walking. Your description of walking hundred of miles to explore and entertain yourself is right up my alley - but if you don’t mind answering, are you male or female? As a female myself I’ve been trying to assess the potential risk factors of wandering around/getting lost in London by myself. Coming from NYC I understand needing to be aware of my surroundings and everything that entails but this is a new city to me and is definitely full of more nooks and crannies than the mostly grid like setup of Manhattan and I definitely would not be super aware of my surroundings by virtue of everything being so new. So as a female would a newcomer not super familiar with the different neighborhoods feel comfortable wandering around alone with the mission of simply discovering the city?"
255,"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 11:37:04 AM GMT+1","Male but I also lived in NYC (Chinatown and Harlem) before moving to London and London has always seemed much safer to me. If you have NYC awareness skills, I think you should be fine most places in London, especially during the daytime."

There were several other people in each class around the same age. I didn’t end up staying in touch with anyone longterm but I definitely enjoyed the classes (and a more extroverted person might have better mileage making outside-of-class connections). Other things I did at that time that we’re non-eating/drinking focused and did result in longer term friendships - joined a monthly book group, volunteering, going to ‘stitch and bitch’ type knitting/crochet meet-ups, going to WI meetings (in London the WIs tend to be pretty young/modern). All of these were cheap or free. You could also go to the public lectures that every university runs (almost always free).

Get into theatre, theatrecraft, masterclass (https://masterclass.org.uk/), showfilmfirst, https://www.mousetrap.org.uk are all great resources espppp if you’re on young side (18 - 30)

As for art galleries, exhibitions are often expensive or sold out, yes, but the permanent collections of places like Tate, National Gallery etc are free and available (though if you can, see the Sophie Taeuber-Arp at Tate Modern, it’s great).

Go on walks. London has beautiful parks - visit as many as you can, in weather good or bad! Hire pedalos and go to the Serpentine Gallery in Hyde Park, walk past Buckingham palace through to Green Park and St James’ park, peek in at the giraffes in Regent’s Park. There are so many gorgeous areas to explore that differ greatly from each other - from the brutalist Barbican to prim and pretty Primrose Hill. So many interesting people have lived in London through the years, have a look for their blue plaques! If you Google you can also find articles on historic places that can only be found when looked for. Today I walked around Holland Park and Notting Hill, the other day I went out to see Richmond. Both trips (minus travel costs, but the underground is v cheap) completely free. On the subject of Richmond, Kew Gardens and Richmond park are great, and I’m a big Ted Lasso fan so I found the different filming locations there. Maybe that’s something else you could do?

I’ve lived in London my entire life, and I go into the city all the time. I don’t drink and I am a vegetarian with food allergies so I never do anything centred on food. I take packed lunches or pick something up in M&S. This has never held me back from fully experiencing the wonders of this magnificent and historic city. You just need to look past the boozers and the foodies to see what London is really about!"
353,"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 4:00:57 PM GMT+1","Museums! We've got so many incredible ones. Science, natural history, British, imperial war, navy, RAF, HMS Belfast, The Globe Theatre (museum and more) Horniman *snigger* museum. There's a cool museum of medicine near Holborn which was very interesting! I won't go into detail on each but plenty of info available online. Most of these if not all have free entry as an added bonus.

There are various gardens, Kew, Kensington, Sky Garden, Kyoto Japanese garden.

More touristy bits like London Dungeons, London Eye, different bus/walking tours. The Jack the Ripper tour around Spitalfields/Whitechapel is great if you like that sort of thing.

Multiple art galleries - National gallery, Tate Gallery for classic, Whitechapel, Saatchi gallery. If modern art is more your thing you've got the Tate modern and Serpentine.

When the weathers nicer the parks are great - Regents, St James, Hyde Park, Alexandra Park, Victoria Park, Hampstead Heath, Primrose Hill.

In Regents Park there's London zoo. We have Sea Life aquarium to explore.

On top of all of that just general exploring places you wouldn't normally visit can be a great day out. Walking round places like Camden Lock, along the Southbank and around Westminster. Everywhere you go will have places of interest if you look closely and research where you are.

Hope that gives you some inspiration!

Honestly there's so much culture and amazing things to do in London!"

For me, one of the best things about London is our museum culture! If you go looking for something that interests you, chances are they’ll be some free-to-enter museum staffed by people who are very helpful And know their stuff.

Alternatively, London has a larger proportions of green space than any other metropolis in the world, and they vary greatly between them, from the cultivated splendour of St. James’, to the wildlife in Richmond Park (Bambi!) or the wilds of Hampstead Heath - there’s something for everyone.

Also you could try some theatre in the west end or just go on a joy ride on the DLR - you can sit right at the front :)

If this doesn’t cut your mustard, then I strongly recommend checking out stuff in Time Out magazine it has everything going on everywhere for everyone normally

Either way there’s lots to do, so get stuck in!

Hope you have a lovely day"

There's tons like them that are more competitive but these are cheap and taken at your own pace.

I've been to going to this for a few years and it's always really fun.

There used to be a downhill soapbox race in Telegraph Park (like a free local version of the Red Bull race at Ally Pally) every year which was fun when I went, though it hasn't been on the last two years because of the pandemic. It should return next year.

The CityMapper app is AMAZING. It shows you the tube transport, busses, the uber boat, and the trains.

If you're anywhere near the Tower, the Crutched Friars has an amazing chicken pot pie. So delicious.

Afternoon tea is a must, but reservations are needed for the most popular.

Don't take the bus tour to Windsor, Bath and Stonehenge. You'll spend more time on the bus than you will viewing anything.

The oyster card needs to be tapped in and out on the uber boat and the tube. Busses you only tap once. The tube stations all have portals to top up your card.

The London eye isn't great. Don't get pulled in to any games on the bridges, they're all scams. If you're going to get souvenirs, leave room in your carryon. Taxis and ubers are great, but the tube stations are more efficient. So you don't need to stay in central London. London is not a breakfast place. Starbucks aren't huge there, but Pret a Manger is, and their food and coffee is simple and cheap.

Borough market is nice, but unless you're staying somewhere with a kitchen, there's not too much to do. But you do you have to go to the Ginger Pig for sausage rolls and Kappacasein Dairy for the raclette. Go early. Maria's Market Cafe has a cheap English breakfast. The bread and butter were delicious.

Pre-order tickets to any of the museums or attractions, because often that line for prepaid tickets are much shorter.

Westminster Abbey is not made for big people in their enclaves, especially where Queen Elizabeth the First is entombed. You WILL have to push to get out, and squeeze by often.

Do several things in one area. We did Buckingham Palace, the war rooms, Westminster Abbey, and the Houses of Parliament in one day.

414,"Monday, August 30, 2021 at 6:44:24 PM GMT+1","I would just add a couple of things!

St. Martin in the Fields church (in Trafalgar Square) has an AWESOME crypt. You can do brass rubbings, which is a ton of fun, and they have an even more awesome English-school-type cafeteria with real old-school type food like Shepherd's pie, and most importantly, apple crumble with Bird's custard. Really a fun afternoon, and especially if it's hot out, it's nice and cool down there.

If you hit hot weather (not sure when you're going), any American business will have proper a/c (the one time you actually do want to stop in at a McDonald's)

Portobello Road is kinda fun, but not necessarily worth the trip

If you like that sort of thing, treat yourself to a nice English tea somewhere. Don't call it ""high tea"" -- that's the farmer's term for a meal closer to supper. You want what's called a ""cream tea."" They'll have them in all sorts of tea rooms. If you want fancy, try Fortnum & Mason's tea room--it's not QUITE as snooty as, say, the Savoy or the Ritz, and it's better than Harrod's, and quite nice. Fortnum's by the way has some amazing tea, honeys, jams, marmalades. If you like real English marmalade, Sir Nigel's is really fantastic--BUT, it's very hard to transport. You can usually find some at the airport on the way out so don't bother lugging it around! Teabags on the other hand are super light and easy to stuff in your suitcase.

I heartily second Citymapper--it's a fantastic app.

I also second the War Rooms. They're like time travel--really incredible. The War Museum is pretty darn good too.

Definitely try to get a nice Cornish pasty while you're there. There are shops that specialize, and you can also find stands at Covent Garden that have them.

ETA: OH! I forgot! Go to a genuinely old pub--this is a legendary one: https://ye-olde-cheshire-cheese.co.uk/about/---amazing experience. Get a basic pub lunch, sausages & mashed potatoes, and a dark, dark Guinness. OMG unforgettable experience!"

For me, I’ll pay full price the first time I go. But I get museum fatigue after a few hours and have to leave, so I don’t feel like I should have to pay full price to come back the next day.

If I wake up in the middle of the night due to jet lag I just go out and start walking in any direction. Also it’s a great way to watch the city come alive at around 5AM, there is no one around all the monuments and it is such a great way to see them without hoards of tourists in the way! (They are not open at that hour of course but they are still there) Standing on a deserted bridge watching and listening to Big Ben strike at 5 or 6AM is something you will never forget!

426,"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 8:43:44 AM GMT+1","The center of London is very walkable. There's not as much traffic as somewhere like say New York or San Francisco. Because there is a fee to drive there

https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge

And because the Tube is so well, a car would be more trouble than it's worth. Find a place to stay near a subway entrance, and Google maps works great for telling you which lines to take, where to transfer, and when. As long as you have data on your phone."

We had to sleep near the airport the night before our flight and had to take the train and wait for a bus to get to hotel and they were on time. Of course, we only had carry-on. It makes riding the train easier - it can get crowded depending on time of day."
436,"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 12:23:44 AM GMT+1","Dated a man over there for over a year and was there often. Soho, South Bank, Hyde Park, Greenwich, Covent Gardens, walking the bridges. I made the mistake of taking ride share when the Tube is so much faster. Still a joke with my friends. Hop On/Hop Off busses are a good way to get around. I did one I just didn't get off and saw the city that way. It can be nice to take one all the way around and then decide, okay I want to get off here and see more.

I really like Brighton for the day too, it's unique. Maybe see if there are day tours to the countryside, it's worth going outside the city. I love Hamleys toy store, it's multi-storied! Harrods and Selfridges are neat stores too, we don't have anything like that here.

Fast casual sushi called Itsu is fantastic and cheap. Tesco grocery has great, cheap food to take away. Saves a lot of money to grab food there. You can get cheap sausage rolls, breakfast and pastries at Gregg's. Tons of kebob and take away shops all over. I honestly found food cheaper there than in the States, casual food, prepared food especially.

Depending on your interests and how detail oriented you are, you can do the “primary London touristy stuff” in 2-3 days. By this I mean: see Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Horse Guard Parade, Trafalgar Square. Etc. most of that stuff is so close together you can do it in one day if you hustle, have good weather, and summer daylight hours.

The museums are amazing. British Museum, Tate Modern, and Tower of London will get a lot of mentions. But don’t forgot the Victoria and Albert Museum.

My favorite thing to do in London, although it can be hard on a seven day trip, is to simply enjoy one of the neighborhoods. Pub crawl in Soho (responsibly, because there are 2-3 pubs on each dang corner), or sit on the patio of a restaurant near Notting Hill and just watch the city go by. Walk to all the different squares in Bloomsbury. Have a picnic in Hyde Park"

If sitting through a service is something you are interested in, try to catch the Evensong service. The services are free to attend, open to all. The choir sings some of the service during Evensong and it is beautiful. Get in line as early as you can so you can sit in the stalls (pews to us) as opposed to just folding chairs. The choir uses the first two rows of the stalls. I was lucky enough to sit behind the choir, hearing them sing brought tears to my eyes and I am not religious at all. It was amazing and by far one of my favorite memories from my trip last year."

For history: Westminster Abbey Tower of London The Cutty Sark Tower Bridge Mueseum Churchhill War Rooms Whitehall Banqueting House

Art: Tate Modern National Portrait Gallery Victoria and Albert Museum British Mueseum

Food: There are tons of lists online depending on your tastes and budgets, so I'll defer to those. But my stand outs are:

St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square.

The White Lion in Covent Garden.

Shopping: Convent Garden/Jubilee Market Greenwich Market (especially if someone in your group loves jewelry and antiques).

My must do list for first timers:

Covent Garden/Jubilee Market

Take the hop on/hop off bus and explore.

Take the Thames Uber Boat to Greenwich for the Cutty Sark (a real 17th century tea ship and incredible museum) and Greenwich Market. Have tea at The Orangery, located in the Fan Museum (as in hand held fans, not ceiling fans). Also the Navel Academy, Maritime Mueseum, and the Queen's House.

Westminster Abbey, Tower of London, Tower Bridge Mueseum (seriously, check it out). Possibly the London Eye, if you have time.

When I’m in London, I click on the card in my wallet and turn on “Express Transit”. That lets me use the phone on the tube and the bus. Just hold the phone near the yellow plastic circle. You get a single TfL credit charge for your transportation usage every night. It’s way better than messing around with Oyster cards.

I have an Ally Bank high interest account for my emergency fund. Their ATM card is part of the AllPoint ATM network which is all over the UK. You get market rate exchange rate and no transaction fees. I have an AllPoint application on my phone for locating ATM machines. In London, there are tons of them.

I use Heathrow as my gateway airport to Europe and always take the Boston-LHR morning flight so I don’t have to overnight on an airplane. I crash at an airport hotel and continue on my way the next day after a leisurely full English breakfast. Off peak, the hotels are inexpensive by London standards so I’ll do my first night at the airport even if I’m in London for a few days. Google Maps tells you what bus to take and it’s £1.65 for the bus ride. Dinner in a pub or an Indian restaurant, in bed by midnight, and I’m in the right time zone the next morning."

There’s sooooo many things you can do that having it really helped me narrow down my itinerary. Plus since you get into nearly all of the big ticket sites with it, chances are you’ll be saving way more money with it. Since historical sites and museums tend to close around 5 or 6 depending when you’ll be there, I was able to see about 2 or 3 things a day. At night I would check what else the pass had on offer outside those hours, and actually ended up doing some things I wouldn’t typically go for and ended up enjoying them. A couple examples are a ticket to any movie at the Curzon in Covent Garden and a ticket to the viewing deck at The Shard. There’s also a ton of free museums, just know that if you’re going during tourist season the lines will be extremely long, especially at the British museum of history. But if you’re looking at historical sites like the abbey, observatory, Kew gardens, Tower of London, Hampton court or Windsor castle (just to name a few) the pass is perfect! Also, if you do end up making the trek out to Greenwich, def check out the painted hall in the old royal naval college! It’s absolutely stunning and I could spend hours just taking it all in. The market there also has tons of street food, and there’s a bakery called Gail’s on the corner across the Greenwich market area that makes a hand pie that’s to die for!"

These are the top 5 free things to do in London.

Visit the museums:
London is home to some of the world's most excellent museums, many offering free admission. The British Museum is home to a vast collection of artifacts and artworks from all over the world, representing a variety of civilizations and historical eras. It houses well-known displays like The Rosetta Stone, the Parthenon sculptures, and the Egyptian mummies.
The Natural History Museum has the giant blue whale skeleton in place of the famous whole-body dinosaur in the main hall. They also have an animatronic T-rex in the Dinosaurs gallery and the Earthquake simulator. If you have kids, it's the perfect place to go.
Many other museums like the Imperial War Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Tate Modern, and the National Gallery are some of the most famous museums you can visit for free. They can usually accommodate walk-ins, but they may not be able to do it during busy periods. So book a timed entry early on through their website, and all of them are entirely free.

View London city from above.
As good as it is to just wander around the city, experiencing the stunning views from its above is also fantastic. Places like Sky Garden and Tate Modern Viewing Platform provide excellent city views.
Sky Garden is an indoor public garden and observation deck located on the 43rd floor of the ""Walkie Talkie"" building, that weird-shaped building you see on the London Skyline. It offers panoramic views of the city. It is free, but you must book in advance, and there may be queues to enter during peak hours. It also has a restaurant. So you can enjoy your meal, looking at the city's view. It is open from 10 am to 6 pm, Monday through Friday, and from 11 am to 9 pm on Saturdays and Sundays. This is probably the best view of the city that you can get from a high-rise building.
The Tate Modern Viewing Platform is located on the 10th floor of the Tate Modern art museum. It provides 360-degree views of the city, including the River Thames, St Paul's Cathedral, and the Shard, and yes, it's always free to enter. No advanced booking is required. It's a museum, so you get two free things to do at the same place.

Roam around the royal parks:
You know you can visit the same Park as the Royal Family does for absolutely nothing. You might bump into the princess there, God knows. Jokes apart! Royal Parks are some of the city's most beautiful and peaceful green spaces. There are eight Royal Parks; Hyde Park, Regent's Park, Greenwich Park, St. James's Park, Richmond Park, Kensington Gardens, Bushy Park, and The Green Park.
They are a great place to relax and unwind, go for a walk, exercise and clear your mind. They have hundreds of buildings, statues and memorials that reflect London's heritage. Grab a picnic basket, and you get yourself a fantastic day out at the Royal parks in London.
The parks also have special activities which you can pay to enjoy. For instance, Hyde park offers horse riding. It has two designated routes for horse riding. Regent's Park is home to the London Zoo, Greenwich Park has the Royal Observatory and so on. You can visit their website for other activities.

Eat at The Churchill Arms:
While this choice doesn't sound like a to-do thing, trust me, it's a must-go place while you're in London, especially if you're photogenic and love flowers. They spend almost 50,000 pounds a year just on the plants and lights. So you know it's something to look at.
It's a restaurant located at 119 Kensington Church Street. They say Winston Churchill's grandparents were regular visitors, so they named it that way, but who knows? It's a Thai restaurant, that's a surprise!! It's covered with flowers all year round except during Christmas when pine trees are all over the building. It's a joy to watch the Christmas lights at night.
You're gonna have to eat. So why not eat tasty food, and enjoy this iconic place at the same time?

Visit The National Gallery:
National Gallery is an impressive collection of over 2,300 paintings from the 13th to the 20th century. You can see paintings by Leonardo da Vinci, Van Gogh, and Rembrandt without spending a single penny. The museum also offers free guided tours, audio guides, and family activities to enhance your experience and help you learn more about the paintings and their history.
Check the museum's website to see which exhibits are currently on display and plan your visit accordingly. It is a large gallery, and it can take several hours to see all the shows. Plan to spend at least a few hours, and consider taking a break at the cafe or restaurant. With so many paintings, it can be overwhelming to try to see everything. Focus on your favorite artists or styles, and use the map to plan your route.
It is located at Trafalgar Square. You can easily spend a whole day exploring the gallery and nearby attractions like the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Houses of Parliament. Zero dollars spent on the day!"

I loved being able to tap in and out of the Tube stations with my phone only. It is very convenient and works like a charm. I pretty much went everywhere using the Tube.

Other suggestions:

Definitely use the reservation/electronic-ticket thing for museums. Most are free, but you save a lot of time by doing the reservation ahead.

At the British Museum, there are two entrance, front and back. Use the back one; it is rarely crowded, while the one in front usually has really long queues. Also, unless you plan on multiple visits (which I did), the British Museum is HUGE, like the Met in NYC, so best to choose a few areas to focus on. Also, if it is crowded, go to the top floor first and work your way down. Most people start at the first floor and work up.

If you are staying in central London and decide to go to the Tower of London (which I thought was WAY over-priced and sort of disappointing), take the Thames Uber-Boat instead of the Tube. It is way faster, and you get a ""cruise"" on the Thames.

I did afternoon Tea and it was not my cup of tea. Expensive and boring. But be sure to go to a good pub and get ""Sunday roast"" with Yorkshire pudding. It's awesome.

If you get fish and chips in a pub, the piece of fish you get is HUGE, so be hungry.

If you are a fan of IPA beer, prepare to be disappointed."
488,"Friday, March 3, 2023 at 11:24:07 PM GMT+1","I agree with all of the above except the last point. It would very much depend on what type of “IPA Fan” you are.

If all you like is a very specific style (perhaps brewed close to where toe from), then you may indeed be disappointed.

If all you like is higher ABV (Impeerial, double, triple, etc) or very distinctly hopped IPAs, then do your homework. It’s definitely here, but you need to know where to find it. This includes beer brewed in London, in the UK more generally, and from around the world.

If you only like modern IPAs, then any place that advertises as selling craft beer (they’re everywhere) will probably suit your fancy.

If you don’t do your homework and just ask for what’s available in the closest old-looking pub then chances are high you might be served a “real ale IPA on cask.” If you don’t know what this is, aren’t aware of IPA or general UK beer history and have only drank modern IPAs then you may be very confused and disappointed.

On the other hand, if you like knowing about history, brewing, serving, and transport in addition to the taste and aroma then there’s a lot to take away from this experience! While very different in taste, aroma and texture to a modern IPA, these beers are as close to a historic IPA as you will get. Read up on the history and enjoy!

For anyone else reading this that would be interested and that has more than a week available then visit Button-upon-Trent. It was where the most popular original IPAs were brewed. It’s said it was because of the mineral content of the local water. Some places will “Burtonize” their water by adjusting the content to try and mimic it. If you really have the time you could also rent a narrow boat and toddle through parts of the canal route that the IPA would have made on its way down to London, stopping for pints at pubs along the route."

Also if you're using the underground be prepared for there to be delays or last minute changes, it happens often.

I'd also advise you to visit different parts of the UK besides London if you're able to as everywhere is different

I don't mean to offend, don't be really loud when in a supermarket or something if you're confused. I don't know why but I've experienced this ALOT with Americans. Just ask people if you're confused or lost, most people are happy to help.

Good luck and have a brilliant time!"

You will almost never need cash as everyone takes (contactless) cards or Apple Pay for most transactions. This includes public transport.

Tube stations are very close together in zone 1 so walk instead.

Don’t walk around staring at your phone as you’ll be putting yourself at risk of having it snatched (usually by a couple of kids on a bike).

498,"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 5:12:20 AM GMT+1",Highly recommend the big red bus/hop on-hop off. Great orientation to the city. Includes narration and is a good way to get around during the day. Ours included a boat ride down the Thames.
499,"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 12:56:52 PM GMT+1",Lots of great advice here. I would add use the buses as they are easy to figure out and they all seem to return to Trafalgar Square so you won’t get lost. They are cheaper than the Tube and you see so much more plus gives your feet a rest for a bit. Normal big city crime so stay alert.

502,"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 7:33:09 AM GMT+1","The healthcare system would be a good thing for an American to see - cheap too!

In all seriousness though, you could plan a nice route to see all the main stops in a day or so and spend more time where you want. Take some time to relax and people watch in the parks, and walk around more local areas (we spent a lot of time in charming paddington)"

For example, Londoners tend to be more reserved and take politeness seriously, so it is important to be respectful and courteous. Additionally, be mindful of the different time zone, as the United Kingdom is five hours ahead of the United States. Finally, it is advisable to purchase a London Travelcard, as it allows for unlimited travel within London on public transport. With this in mind, be sure to take advantage of all the wonderful sights and attractions while in London!"

It’s such an important part of English culture. Also ride the tube enough that you get comfortable with it and book a high tea somewhere nice."

510,"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 12:34:00 PM GMT+1","The Tower of London tour is also amazing! And best if you go when the guide is doing it.

511,"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 1:01:30 PM GMT+1","It depends on what your interests are and how you like to see/tour/vacation. If you enjoy walking and don't have an ambitious list of trying to hit all the major touristy things in your short week, start in the neighborhood where you will be staying and, by foot, explore/visit/see the things surrounding your hotel and then work your way further out in perimeter. You miss a lot whizzing from museum to museum to museum by tube or bus. Some places I'd say are ""must see/tour"" include the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey (so much history in both and incredible architecture) and for fun British royal tradition, get to the palace early to get a good standing location for the changing of the guard.

523,"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 5:09:25 PM GMT+1","London dungeons, Big Ben and the houses of Parliament, all the museums, London eye, Tower of London, lots and lots of live shows and sports events all the time, Buckingham Palace, the Shard, Shakespeare's globe, Tate modern. London's one of the best cities in the world, a million things to do."
524,"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 6:14:47 PM GMT+1","London is absolutely full of things worth visiting as a tourist. I’m not from London, but am British so have been around 100 times or so to London. I’m also quite well travelled and can say the only cities that can compete with it for sheer number of attractions are New York, Paris, Rome, Luxor/Cairo.

In terms of stuff to do, here’s a list. Will try to avoid writing detail about everything:

MUST SEE

Palace of Westminster/Big Ben, London Eye and Westminster Abbey

Tower Bridge and Tower of London

The walking route of Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, Regent Street and Oxford Street. This is the most iconic set of London walkways

British Museum - for ancient/classical period, this is hands down the best museum in the world, better than Louvre still.

Greenwich - the view from the hill of Canary Wharf is beautiful; the observatory and meridian are amazing too; naval museum nice too

City of London/the Shard,Tate Modern, St Paul’s Cathedral, London Bridge/Southbank, Borough Market. These are all so close to each other, definitely a must to visit this region as each individual thing is very good.

personally think though Globe Theatre is a bit overrated, it’s just a reconstruction.

WORTH SEEING IF HAVE TIME

Various sporting venues, these are some of the most famous in the world: Wembley, Lord’s, Twickenham, Wimbledon, Olympic Park

Museum Quarter Kensington - Natural History, V+A, Science

Churchill War Rooms

Buckingham Palace - very controversial but this is overrated for me, probably because the aesthetic is done to death on our News channels. For international tourists, it’s probably much more interesting

Kew Gardens

Harrod’s - this is pretty awesome if you like shopping, though mostly unaffordable.

Soho, Shoreditch for the younger person/bar/club scene. Clapham if that’s youre thing too..

ESSENTIAL DAY TRIPS

Oxford and/or Cambridge. I am biased being an alumnus, but there are no cities in England as unique, medieval and pretty as these (except the small Cotswold towns but they are far). These are England’s equivalent to Europe’s preserved medieval gems - ie. Prague, Lisbon , Edinburgh. The punt down the river Cam is breathtaking.

Stonehenge

(only if you want to desperately see a castle) Windsor Castle, Warwick Castle, Dover Castle

SEMI-ESSENTIAL DAY TRIPS

Chalk coasts of Southern England - Dover, Seven Sisters

(if have time to stay over 1 night) EDINBURGH - this is the prettiest city in the U.K. and one of the best in Europe

Bath"

541,"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:08:41 PM GMT+1",Agreed. Nice to hear some positivity about our city. Usually all I get is I do not get why you live here etc. I think also people need to understand London is not just Westminster/Piccadilly etc. Lots of boroughs will different characters.

It has so much history, impressive architecture, lots of landmarks, many attractions, world class museums (that are free to enter), great theatre shows, beautiful parks, excellent public transport, a large variety of food options...I could go on.

Yes it's expensive and the weather can be gloomy at times but not many cities can offer as much as London can."

Mum Likes Thai Food in Bethnal Green for the best pad Thai ever. Cha cha roll for sushi burritos."
566,"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:14:03 PM GMT+1","Definitely visit Camden Town Market. Huge indoor market with shopping and all the ethnic street food you can imagine.

You start in a location and you are texted your first clue, you have to look around you to figure it out then text the answer back to get the next clue. Sometimes you even had to interact with bar staff /others to get clues!

I can't remember the exact company but it was something like this www.inthehiddencity.com/london-treasure-hunt

If you are able bodied and up for a lot of walking I'd absolutely recommend it!

Also I think it's worth having a drink in the shard to take in the views, you don't have to book and can just queue for a table. There were 3 of us last time we did this and we shared a bottle of wine, it was £40 so pricey, but between 3 it wasn't too bad and the views are breathtaking, especially the view from the toilets!"

And sparkle once again

631,"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 3:46:48 AM GMT+1","In my opinion, London's royal heritage, stylish appeal, distinctiveness, rich history, and seamless blend of tradition and modernity make it the most beautiful city in the world, particularly as a megapolis. It is a place where the past seamlessly intertwines with the present, creating a cityscape that is both awe-inspiring and enchanting."

Edit to add, I like traveling to experience wildly different cultures than what I’m used to (I want extreme culture shock), being American, and England just doesn’t seem like the kind of place that would give me any sort of culture shock. Like the top of my list right now, even though it’ll never happen sadly, would be to visit Yemen, Pakistan, Somalia, etc."
646,"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:04:51 PM GMT+1","I'm not the OP but London is along with NYC the top city in the world. The sheer amount of things to see, do, eat and experience is staggering. I'd say it has a slight edge over NYC due to its 2000 year history. Most of its museums are even free, which is remarkable."

662,"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:29:06 PM GMT+1",London is a great walking city. The South Bank by the Thames is a great place to go. If you're a beer drinker then London has many many pubs. I also recommend doing the City River tour that takes you to Greenwich. Then you can stand on 2 different time zones...
663,"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:55:27 PM GMT+1","Most galleries museums are free or if there's a cost it's pretty cheap. My personal faves the National Art Gallery by trafalgar square, the Magic Circle Museum, the National History Museum (it's also right by the Science Museum in South Kensinton) and the Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities.

Another fav things of mine to do is walk along the canals and sit by a spot around the canals on King'sCross or Islington with some wine/cheese.

There's also cematary visits/walks ...Highgate Cematary is great .

Also Parkland walk is one of my favs....it stretches through to Finsbury Park and is basically an abandoned train route turned overgrown path filled with graffiti, street art, and random public art."

Handwritten Beatles lyrics, Don Quixote manuscript, DaVinci notebooks, Jane Austen's desk, the Magna Carta, and on and on and on. Went there on a lark, ended up balling like a baby because I was so totally overwhelmed by the magnitude and importance of the artifacts they have on display. (I think it was ""Don Quixote"" that ultimately brought me to tears (is my favorite book of all time)). It's one of my favorite museums in London, and that's saying something. Really, can't recommend it enough if you like that kind of thing. Have a blast, London is totally fabulous!"
668,"Saturday, July 8, 2023 at 4:21:06 AM GMT+1",Go to Borough Market ( I sample all the foods I can 😛) visit the Sherlock Holmes Museum and take a walk across the Millennium Bridge. If your really into spooky and gothic things you should visit Highgate Cemetery.
669,"Sunday, July 16, 2023 at 8:41:41 AM GMT+1","As someone who has been to London six times and just got back in February, the biggest advice I can give you is to prioritize. What really interests you? Do you want history? Art? Are you a foodie? Shopping? Then go from there.

For history: Westminster Abbey Tower of London The Cutty Sark Tower Bridge Mueseum Churchhill War Rooms Whitehall Banqueting House

Art: Tate Modern National Portrait Gallery Victoria and Albert Museum British Mueseum

Food: There are tons of lists online depending on your tastes and budgets, so I'll defer to those. But my stand outs are:

St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square.

The White Lion in Covent Garden.

Shopping: Convent Garden/Jubilee Market Greenwich Market (especially if someone in your group loves jewelry and antiques).

My must do list for first timers:

Covent Garden/Jubilee Market

Take the hop on/hop off bus and explore.

Take the Thames Uber Boat to Greenwich for the Cutty Sark (a real 17th century tea ship and incredible museum) and Greenwich Market. Have tea at The Orangery, located in the Fan Museum (as in hand held fans, not ceiling fans). Also the Navel Academy, Maritime Mueseum, and the Queen's House.

Westminster Abbey, Tower of London, Tower Bridge Mueseum (seriously, check it out). Possibly the London Eye, if you have time.

V&A and British Mueseum"

Follow along regent street and oxford streets to bond street. There's a ton of free and interesting things to see along that path.

I think south Kensington and Kensington gardens is a nice area to walk as well."

Churchill's War Rooms. This was an awesome museum.

I know a lot of people didn't like Stonehenge, but we took a private tour that allowed you to go into the rocks, and it was surreal.

Jack the Ripper tour. Make sure you research this one. I saw a lot of theatrical tour guides that were all show and no substance. Our tour guide had written a book and knew his stuff."

London is a very walkable city. I would also suggest getting a pass for the Tube. It’s very convenient and easy to navigate. The hop on hop off bus is a great way to see the city. I always do this on day one to get a feel for the city.

Also, the Eurostar train can take you to Paris in 2.5 hours. I would highly recommend seeing both cities if you have time. It’s a great day trip."

I’m going back next year & plan on Kew Gardens, Chelsea Physic Garden and several more around London. I love to look at gorgeous food and Harrod’s food court was mind blowing. I just stared and salivated for hours. British Museum & Victoria & Albert Museum are not to be missed. Try to just chill out some. I used to wear myself out on vacation but I take a breather now & then and remember that I can’t get it all in. So….enjoy!"
712,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 5:34:59 PM GMT+1","Walking tours. London has TONS of them and they are, in my book, the best way to see the city. They all have different themes and purposes including for specific historical periods like the Blitz or Victorian, there's pub crawls through historic pubs, there's also ones for famous figures like Charles Dickens, Shakespeare, and Jack the Ripper. My family has done many of these and some more than once, even on ones we've done before we always see and learn something new."
713,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 9:10:39 PM GMT+1","The best money I spent there was for the Big Red Bus pass. You can ride different routes to all the sites, get off, walk around, get back on, all the major attractions are accessible and it's a cost saver on transportation! I have to make a trip back...loved that city, didn't have enough time there!"
714,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 1:34:38 AM GMT+1",Great tip! What is the cost of the big red bus pass?
715,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 8:43:07 PM GMT+1","Buckingham palace, Bath, shopping"
716,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 1:35:12 AM GMT+1","Borough market is super yummy. I often get a picnic there when I’m in town. I can vouch for the empanada stand, the mushroom pate, and the custard tarts, gosh yum!

Prince Albert’s museums are free, they include the Victoria and Albert as well as the Natural History one, it looks like a cathedral but every detail is made to honor nature. I love Prince Albert for his patronage and legacy of educational palaces for us.

It’s also free to wander Covent Garden, if you’re there on a good weather day it’s also a musical treat with many buskers.

Restaurants - Masgouf (incredible Iraqi food), Le Comptoire (try the pomegranate chicken), Clarence pub at Trafalgar Square :)"
717,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 12:46:15 PM GMT+1","We did a Jack the Ripper tour — which was fun— as ya got a walking tour with it as well.

My fav part of the trip was wandering around the different SOHO pubs late at night — catching live bands— and mingling with locals."
718,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 3:28:51 AM GMT+1","Sky Garden is a beautiful observation deck that is free but you do need to have a ticket. There are a limited number of walk-in entries available if you don't get your tickets ahead of time. There are restaurants up there but you can also just do the observation deck for free. Great views of the entire city!!

720,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 4:46:28 AM GMT+1",We did a red bus tour to see all the things we might want to visit on our own. A nice way to see a lot of London quickly and choose what you want to do on your own.
721,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 5:38:37 AM GMT+1",I like the idea of seeing a lot of London in a short amount of time.
722,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 7:22:06 AM GMT+1","Go to the theater! The theater is partially funded by the state and ticket prices are reasonable compared to Broadway. You can see big time English actors doing live theater. I've seen Ralph Fiennes and Judy Dench on stage in London. (They both played M in the recent Daniel Craig James Bond movies if you don't recognize those names.)

https://www.walks.com/ are walking tours of London scheduled in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Some really fascinating subjects including Jack the Ripper, Shakespeare & Dickens, the Beatles, etc.

Finally, take a tour of the Tower. Fascinating history and the Crown Jewels are on display."
723,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 8:46:44 AM GMT+1","The Sir John Soan museum in Holborn is an incredible small museum stuffed with the great man’s collection and is a brilliant window into the 18th and early 19th century upper class mind (although he came from humble beginnings). It has wonderful art as well, especially an incredible Canaletto. It’s also around the corner from Lincoln’s Inn, one of the four Inns of Court and is so worth a walk around, it’s full of beautiful architecture and is still a hive of activity for barristers, you can get a guided tour."
724,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 10:08:42 AM GMT+1","I could happily spend all day in any of the many free museums. Once I’m done with the museum, I like wallowing the neighborhood. There are lots of I interesting shops and parks around. Some of the small old streets are cool to explore as well."

726,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 9:00:48 PM GMT+1","You’ve had quite a lot of comments. I’m sure it will have been mentioned, but the Natural History Museum is a must. Get there when it opens and get the dinosaurs done first then do what you can of the rest of this incredible place. I’d recommend a wander around Camden Market too."
727,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 10:18:00 AM GMT+1","Gods own Junkyard, eel pie island, Kyoto Gardens in Holland Park, the rooftop botanic garden in Canary Wharf, boat ride from Canary Wharf to the London eye (cost me about £6), sky garden, highgate cemetery"

731,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 12:25:38 PM GMT+1","Those are some of my favourite free spots in London and places where I took friends/relatives coming to visit me:

Greenwich - the Maritime Museum is free and if you walk up to the observatory you have a breathtaking view. You can go there with the boat from London city centre. I think one of the spots to get the boat for Greenwich is London Bridge station and another Embankment but you have certainly more options.

Richmond park (you see deers just hanging around) and you can walk on the Thames

Camden Town is worth to see

Tate modern (free + nice walk on the Thames bank).

St. Paul cathedral (I saw it for free, not sure if this is a rule or I was just lucky)

Bucking Palace, you can see the change of the guard for free from the gate

Hyde Park is worth visiting

Bear in mind that most museums in London are free: national history, science museum, naval museum, Victoria and Albert museum, National Gallery, British museum and so on.

The only attraction I paid a ticket for and I thought it was well worth a visit was Hampton Court. My favourite thing were the gardens and the park, so if it is a raining day might not be a good idea to go there.

South bank is a nice walk too, and there is always something going on, often for free.

You can find free event on Time Out London."

733,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 1:19:53 PM GMT+1",Borough Market. And just near there is George Inn Gallery Pub which was founded in 1542 and Shakespeare used to drink there!
734,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 1:32:44 PM GMT+1","and Shakespeare used to drink there!

It is possible but there doesn't seem to be any evidence for that, and the current building was built after he died You can have Charles Dickens at least."
735,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 2:01:23 PM GMT+1","I thought no one knows if Shakespeare ever existed. Did he? Also, thanks for your suggestions. ☺️"
736,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 2:30:42 PM GMT+1",Not free but £15 or cheaper if you’re a student. London Walks is amazing. All of their guides are excellent and they cover so many interesting topics on their walks.
737,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 3:27:30 PM GMT+1","I am not a student, sadly 😔"
738,"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 3:39:10 PM GMT+1","When you get there, take a look at air bnb in the ""experiences"" category! It has tons of activities that locals host that you can pay to do, like pub crawls, different classes (cooking and art), or really great in depth walking tours. My friend and I went last October and went on a really excellent walking tour with a local archeologist who showed us a bunch of really cool historical sites throughout the city."

London Bridge Tour -it was ""ehh"" --like 30 pounds or something

Torchure Museum - it was ""cool, and woah"" - like 30 pounds or something

Downtown London for food and sites - it was ""meh, it's a city"" - 20 pounds at most

Big Ben - it's a clock tower.. take a pic and move on - FREE

Harry Potter Studios - it was ""cool, i'd do it again"" - 40-50 pounds i think

Olympic Soccer Match for bronze - ""almost fell asleep, but beer was good"" - I can't remember Pounds or something.

Saw a Fox or something at 2am roaming the streets of London while we figured out how to get to a night bus route because the trains all stopped at 1am or something like that and just stopped and we had to get off miles before our exit. - it was ""pretty awsome and adventurous!"" - FREE!"
