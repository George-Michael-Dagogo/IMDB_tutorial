"February 20, 2020",Ceremony of the Keys,"For years on my bucket list has been to see the Ceremony of the Keys - the ceremonial closing of the Tower of London each night. Once they put this online I was able to book (it was 20 months in advance!) and finally tick off my wish.Doors opened at 9.30pm and we were given a very witty and interesting pre-tour escort by one of the Yeoman warders. The ceremony and its history was explained in the atmospheric Tower confines. Standing by traitors gate on a cold and damp February evening, picturing back in time certainly gave me the shivers!The ceremony itself was everything the British do best - I recommend if you can being at the far right of traitors gate, facing Wakefield Tower, for the best views. You are standing for about 40 minutes so the old and infirm, or very young, might find this a bit hard work. I really recommend it, if you get the chance, it felt like a privilege to witness a ceremony unchanged in 700+ years."
"February 11, 2020",Incredible historic site!,"The amount of history that is preserved and shared with the public is incredible. The Crown Jewels, the armoury, the animals, the cells, there is so much to see. You can take your time and wonder around, you can do an audio tour as well. There is a commemorative book that you can purchase for 5 pounds"
"October 28, 2020","Definitely NOT value for money, sorry.","My friend  and I Visited the Tower today, but it wasn’t really anything like we expected. It’s just a glorified musuem. I paid £25 a ticket, it was supposed to include The Crown Jewels, but the queue was ridiculously long, at least a 2 hour wait, we are in our 60’s and would never be able to queue that long. there should have been set times to queue for the jewels, There were no Yeomen guided tours, assumedly because if the pandemic, so all we saw were a few exhibits, a few information plaques and not much else.We treated ourselves to a scone with cream and jam and a cappuchino each and it came to a whopping £14! And they even charge a fiver each for the audio guides! I know they have lost millions due to lockdown, but these prices are just extortionate!A waste of money in my opinion,"
"September 26, 2020",Really disappointing ,While we were expecting changes due to covid - one way systems and extra queing time we were not prepared for most of the attractions to be shut. The buildings inside were crammed with no social distancing and no staff presence to enforce sense and order and the route forces you to walk your children through two gift shops which adds insult to injury when already paying full price for half an experience.If you want to visit I would wait until things are back to normal  
"January 2, 2020",A must see and do when in London!,I visited the Tower for the fifth time in my life in November as its my favourite historical place in the UK. Anyone visiting London for the first time should make this place their first location to visit as its where London really all began in 1066. It encompasses the history of our country in one location with so many memorable events and so many tales to be told by the excellent Yeoman of the guard who conduct the excellent tours. Lastly a visit to the Crown Jewels is a must as they are breathtaking and displayed in a memorable exhibit. A great value day out for all the family especially good for children to provide them with a better illustrated understanding of English history.
"January 7, 2020",A must see on a London visit,We were fortunate to visit on a cold weekday in January. No crowds do our ability to see and enjoy exhibits unencumbered by long lines made the visit delightful. I highly recommend purchasing the audio guide. The Cafe was reasonably priced with good options for a snack or lunch. 
"August 26, 2020",Nice day out ,"We had a really good day out to the tower today. You have to book in advance and we booked the 10.30 slot, if you can definitely book early as it got busier in the afternoon. We waited 10 minutes to see the Crown Jewels and 20mins to access the white tower. Wait times were considerably longer by the afternoon. The staff are doing a great job managing access to ensure social distancing is maintained. Almost everywhere is now open with the exceptions of the church and the Beauchamp tower. Be aware the HRP cafe is closed and only a Gourmet Sausage outlet is open so queues are huge and the food was atrocious. £6.50 for a bratwurst in a role, very poor quality and definitely not worth it. If we had know. I’d have brought food in with us. This was the only part of the day to let us down. "
"January 28, 2020","Thousand Year Old Architectural Treasure Stands Invincible, on the Banks of the Thames","My most recent encounter with the Tower was on a surprisingly sunny afternoon in January. I was at a distance, actually, looking across the Thames from the south bank. I was walking along the embankment, indulging in a slow gaze sweep across the river to the north bank when my eyes spotted the Tower. This imposing many towered castle fortress stands on its own grounds and therefore is not swallowed by nearby London skyscrapers, but gleams white and solid with the river before it. What a sight it is, in theatre slang, a 'real show stopper'. From my vantage point, I didn't see the crowds that cluster and walk through the castle daily. I've been one of them a few times, though, and can vouch for the inside being as impressive as the outside. Go early, before the doors open, and get in the queue before it becomes a long line that stretches out onto the streets of busy London. Inside you will see the crown jewels of many past rulers of England as well as the present Queen Elizabeth. Also on view are the armor of Henry VIII and other important medieval artifacts, including instruments of torture used to extract confessions during the centuries when the Tower was used as a prison. You will learn the history of the Tower .as you walk from room to room (It was built by William the Conquerer shortly after he invaded England in 1066 as a fortress and monument to his power and governmental reign.).Don't forget the ravens. There are six of them kept on the grounds at all times in deference to an old belief that it is good luck for the Kingdom's present and future; conversely, the ruination of the Tower is certain if the ravens are absent, and the Kingdom will fall, according to the legend. If you are lucky you will see one or more of the large, black feathered, yellow beaked creatures.You will definitely spot the red uniformed, white ruffed Yeomen Warders, who are another of the Tower's iconic figures, a combination castle Royal guard, keeper of the Ravens and the grounds, and guides for visitors maintenance. These women and men are hospitable, full of information about the Tower and have full, humorous personalities, no shrinking violets in that group! Plan a half day if you want to take it all in and go as early as you can. Or book an advanced ticket on the Tower's website and get a timed entry plus a tour. Well worth it."
"September 20, 2020",Perhaps expensive but so worth it!,"It’s such a long time since I visited the Tower of London and at £67.50 for the two adults and a child you couldn’t call it cheap. However, it was SO worth it and I’d recommend it as a day out that is great value for money. Shame the Coronavirus has reduced numbers so much and also makes the cafe and refectory not worth opening, but it’s a small point. "
"June 20, 2020",Arrive early ,"One of the MUST dos in London at least once, this place was a joy to explore. We took about 4 hours to feel like we explored enough of the grounds about 85%.  We really enjoyed the crown jewels. Truly breathtaking. Tip, arrive before opening to get in line. If you have an e ticket purchased through trip advisor or Get your Guide for example, you'll still need to line up in a separate line to obtain a physical ticket.They don't inform you until you're at the gate so beware. We waited in 3 separate lines before we finally got in to the right one with the right form of ticket. More signage could really avoid this. No photos of the crown jewels allowed but you can stay as long as you like. Again another pro tip, go straight to the crown jewels upon entering as a separate line will form quickly for that building alone."
"October 9, 2021",Simply amazing,"We knew the Tower of London was one of the top attractions here in London, however, the history and the crown jewels just blew us away.  The most important thing is to get the beefeater to give you a tour. Every hour on the hour there is one available just inside the main gate you will see a small crowd gathering around him. They are the most entertaining and funny lot . Facemasks were requested to be worn inside the buildings but not outside. The Crown  jewel area was the most crowded but everybody kept trying to adhere to the social distancing. The  jewels are very real - there are coronation crowns etc decorated with the most amazing precious stones among which are the largest diamond  and the second largest diamond in the world. Unfortunately no photography is allowed. Everywhere else you can take pictures. The Armory in the White tower is incredible  should not be skipped. When you’re done with the tower of London, take some time to walk along the wharf to admire the Tower Bridge that’s very nearby."
"January 8, 2020",Excellent Visit to Tower of London,"We visited the Tower of London in the late afternoon about 2 hours before closing.  We walked the grounds ourselves and enjoyed the scenery, information, and shops. We did not participate in the guided tour as we wanted to be certain to see the Crown Jewels before closing but stayed with it for a few stops and felt it would have been a good tour to continue if we had the time.  The exhibit that included the jewels was amazing as were all of the pieces of armor and armament on display.  Overall, well worth the price of admission even if though it was an abbreviated visit."
"February 16, 2020",Absolutely amazing ,If you love history The tower is a must.  We opted to wait for the guided Yeoman tour which was amazing. Our guide was very informative and hilarious. Unfortunately I don’t remember his name but he was brilliant. It is so impressive. The Crown Jewels exhibit is a highlight along with the white tower. You do need about 3 hours to see everything There is so much to see and it has a lovely cafe you can stop at for lunch or a snack. The food is good quality and reasonably priced. One of the highlights of our London trip 
"February 4, 2020",Call me old,"Call me old but my visit was less than perfect. At issue isn’t the contents of the castle (they’re extravagant and masterfully displayed). Remember, your looking at 1,000 years of history!My issue was the huge (literally)amount of uncontrollable elementary schoolers that ran rampant through the exhibition. Entire classes of students crammed everything. This was particularly true of the Crown Jewels & White Tower exhibitions. The noise and outright congestion and disruptions were too much. I’d would also suggest that the audio devises and user interface need simplified. I can’t believe how old I sound. But I’m not.......scary!"
"April 16, 2022",Pay a fortune to stand around in queues,Didn't actually get to see the crown jewels on this visit as queue was approx 2 hours long. Lengthy queues to enter most of the attractions on the day we visited including a lengthy queue to enter in the first place ( with a pre-booked ticket and time slot) At £79 for 2 adults and 1 child I feel this was an absolute waste of time and a total rip off. Do yourself a favour and visit one of the many free and wonderful museums such as the Natural history museum or Victoria and Albert instead of this money grab. Poor show.
"January 4, 2020",Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly. 4th Jan 2020 10:00am tour,Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly led the 10am slot tour for a relatively large group. He immediately grabbed the attention of all attendees with his enthusiasm and detailed explanation of the history of the place. You can tell he really enjoys his job and because of that we also enjoyed the entire tour. Well done Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly! I thoroughly enjoyed the tour. Huzzah!😎
"February 21, 2020",Very interesting ,"I hadn’t been to the tower for over 40 years, so was looking forward to it.You should definitely take advantage of the free Beefeater tour which lasts around 45 minutes (you need to have paid the general admission price to access this) - it’s very informative & you get a real insight into their history. Obviously, a real hi light is the Crown Jewels, but I loved going up the towers & also seeing the armour and weapons, and reading about the prisoners and executions! You can really spend a good few hours exploring & the cake in the cafe is very good! A great experience, worth the money in my opinion."
"January 26, 2020",Long,"If you care about history, you will enjoy it. Definitely buy audio guide for 5$, without it, you won't even know where you are going. You will spend minimum 2h there, prepare for it, cofee shop and toilets are available so thats not a problem."
"February 18, 2020",Grisly Tales of the Tower,"A brilliant tour led by Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly. He is a raconteur par excellence with a wealth of grisly historical knowledge about the tower. I did consider knocking a star off as I'm not sure his claim to be the best looking Yeoman Warder since their formation in 1485 can be historically verified. However, staying for photos with the children in the rain at the conclusion of the tour gets him a full 5 stars. "
"January 2, 2020",The Amazing Tower of London,"Just had a wonderful day at the Tower of London. I can’t speak highly enough of the Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters). They were amazing with my 4.5 year old daughter, taking both time and interest in answering her many questions and signing her Paddington book about the tower. She can’t stop talking about them and what a great day she had. Special mention to #398"
"February 20, 2020",A good family outing,An absolutely excellent stop on the tourist trail. I highly recommend going early in the morning to avoid queues. Go see the Crown Jewels first for the same reason. The White Tower had a great interactive room for kids of all ages. 
"January 30, 2020",weekend break,"I’ve been before but decided to get the audio tour device and it was well worth the extra money . Took my time and learnt a lot about my counties history that I didn’t know ,even the pouring down with rain didn’t spoil the day .The only down point was all the children on school days out who were not interested ,rude and disruptive.Just a note book on line it’s a lot cheaper then you can afford the Audio device .Overall it’s a fantastic day out ."
"January 15, 2020","You can spend an entire day here, and enjoy the entire day, if you like History","We bought our tickets in advance and printed them and had no issues. We came when it opened and picked up our headphones for the audio tour. We skipped the Beefeater tour as it had over 50 people in it. The audio tour takes you first through the outer walls before starting on the inside where the crown jewels etc are. If you have loads of time, do it this way. If you're in a hurry, go straight to the jewels. It was everyone's favorite part of the tour, they were absolutely breathtaking.Accessibility - There are lots of stairs and even footing. The outer walls are a long walk of stairs and uneven surfaces. The jewels were on ground level and i do not recall more than a few stairs to see them. We visited late November and it was quite chilly, I can imagine just how hard it would be to do this tour during summer, so i would choose earlier in the day if you plan to visit during the hotter months."
"January 12, 2020",Wonderful family experience ,"Our family visited on a cold, very crowded day in late December. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and loved the touch of the Charles Dickens -type actors with the Christmas theme. We waited a while to see the Jewels but well worth it. Can’t imagine a visit to London being complete without a visit to Tower of London "
"October 24, 2023",Tower of London- a historical fort.,"The Tower of London is a lovely historic monument in the heart of the city. Located next to Tower Bridge, the tickets can be purchased in advance which is the best to avoid waiting in queues. Once you enter look out for the hourly tour by the Yeoman Wardens also known as Beafeaters, the care takers of this historic fort, castle and Crown Jewels. They have lots to share if the history of all whole lived and died at the tower during its almost 1,000 year history. There are multiple museums inside and many buildings. However we recommend that the Crown Jewels, the White Tower and the superstition surrounding the ravens not be missed. We were fortunate to see lots of actors portraying kings and queens past who were dressed up and moving around the property. They kept the kids very engaged. The property has two bathrooms at different locations, some food available and lots to learn about the History of England. It can get a bit tiring for the kids, so we recommend doing this as a morning activity or a time when the kids are fresh."
"January 7, 2022",This is kind of detailed!,"Ok, so this is definitely a must see, per what everyone else has said. So I am going to focus on details because as a tourist I didn't seem to be able to drudge up a brain cell when planning this visit.  *It is not cheap and nonrefundable (although they WILL try to work on a change of date) so be sure you are going to make it and make it on time. Give yourself lots of time to get there if you are using public transport because they give you an hour window. We did go early and it was nice to beat the crowds for sure. * I wondered what to wear. Sounds dumb but I am from the desert and had this idea we would be indoors mostly but the tour is outside so you def want to wear layers. There are stairs but I think if you have comfortable walking shoes on it is fine. The indoors isn't super hot but crowded which can feel stuffy. * did I use the tour book. Not really and kind of ... shouldn't have bought it. It is lovely but to pack and bring home and didn't open it really except once to see what it considered ""must sees"". *there is coffee and little snacks inside so if you are running late you WILL be able to get some stuff inside. Prices are reasonable.* I was confused about the beefeater tour thing - you just join a tour at the hour with an available beefeater. Ours was entertaining. We got there early so did the 10am tour and THEN the jewels. It seemed still fine at that time, but if you get there at 9 you can easily see the jewels, get coffee, etc and then join the 10am tour. "
"January 2, 2020",Stunning!! But be prepared to queue.,"This is a must see when you are in London. It has so much history and there is just so much to see. You really probably need a good half a day to do it justice. One of the main attractions if not the main attraction is the Crown Jewels. They are worth lining up for and you will be lining up. It took me a about 45 minutes to get inside. That was at around 11.30 am. It is worth noting that don't think that you will come back later when the line is shorter. The staff told me at the time that the line was actually quite short and that it would get much longer later. It certainly did, at around 1.00pm the line was far longer. My advice just go and line or try getting there earlier than later. Once inside the Crown Jewels are breathtaking. With something like £3 billion pounds were of riches housed there. With such value you will be equally impressed by the vault that houses them. The doors on the vault are almost as amazing as the jewels themselves. I can also recommend doing a Yeoman Warder tour (the Yoeman Warders are commonly referred to as a Beefeaters). The tour is filled with the history of the Tower which at times can be a bit grim, but they also put some appropriately placed humour throughout as well. The tour is well worth doing.Just always keep in mind that the queues are going to be big. So be prepared and patient. They are sites worth waiting for."
"January 16, 2020",The story of London in a nutshell,"The castle of London, named ""tower"", is a must go. Highly recommended are the tours guided by the Yeoman warders (or Beefeaters, which they don't really like being named that...).If the queue to the royal jewels is too long, don't worry. It will go quickly, as the system inside is made so people will not spend too much time admiring them (there is really a treadmill so you wont stop too long!).The ravens are worth a visit, as is the White Tower and their collection of old armours.All the family had a blast here. Make sure you have at least half a day to enjoy it properly."
"August 29, 2021",Pure history,"Visited Sunday 10am on 29th August 21, had to pre book tickets which were easy to do. Easy to gain entry and pass security checks. Various hand sanitizer stations around the whole site. If you love history then well worth the visit, traitors gate, the torture tower, prison tower, the main tower with Henry 8ths armour and other kings and queens equipment. The crown jules is worth seeing and you go on an escalator which keeps people moving. Be warned lots of steep steps around the towers etc so if you struggle with steps maybe just visit and do the ground stuff. Guards on duty same as Windsor castle, ravens roam free around the grounds who are used to people. Plenty of staff around to ask questions too and gain knowledge from. Per visit it takes 2-3hrs to complete. As usual gift shops around. If you live old British history with kings including Charles 1,2 Henry 3, 8 then worth the visit."
"September 26, 2021",Triple Check Closing Times,"We were a family of 4 adults and managed to get a 2 for 1 deal which I thought made the admission costs just about worth it. We started off with a Yoeman’s Tour which I thought was very good, it wasn’t too short or too long and gave me a good sense of foundational knowledge to look around afterwards. I was very surprised at how beautiful I found the jewels however I did feel like the wording of how we “occupied” some of the jewels was a little too generous. Unfortunately we hadn’t realised that the winter closing times had come into effect since we planned the trip and ended up with only 3 hours to view the place. Which meant we missed a few areas and rushed around some of the exhibits, so do allow plenty of time to look around. In our research we read that the closing time listed was the closing time for the buildings but you would have half an hour to look around after that. This is wrong, we were all ushered out a little before closing time and they wouldn’t even allow my family members outside to wait for me until I could leave the building and were politely threatened with security which left us all feeling a little sour with the place after a pleasant afternoon."
"January 1, 2020",Huge Attraction,This was the only real attraction that I spent time in during my two days in London. I bought tickets beforehand and they accepted both electronic and printed tickets. I went a little before the Tower opened for the day so I was able to see mostly everything. The first thing I checked out were the Crown Jewels which are a must see. I think I spent around 2-3 hours here and that is a lot for me since I go through museums very quickly. What kept my interest here was how large this attraction was and that we get to go into various areas of the Tower to check out different rooms and what they were used for. I did wait for the Yeoman Warder (Beefeater) tour but it was a bit hard to hear the tour guide since there were many people on each tour so eventually I went to explore on my own.
"October 14, 2020",Time to go to the Tower,"Great afternoon out at Tower of London even with Covid restrictions. Still plenty to see in a safe environment. The grandchildren enjoyed meeting the ravens, talking to the Beefeaters, climbing the stairs and seeing the exhibits in the White Tower and finally visiting the crown jewels. Although there are areas which can not be accessed due to Covid, it is still worth visiting as there was no que to see the crown jewels which are spectacular.The small cafe on site has limited menu. If you have young children bring a picnic lunch until the main cafe re opens. Hot drinks and sandwiches can also be purchased as you leave the Tower. The gift shops are open, a little expensive but some unique items can be purchased."
"February 18, 2020","Really good, much better than expected ","DO the tour!, very informative & well presented/humorous. Takes one hour. Long queue for Crown Jewels, but worth it. Cafe Very expensive, you can take your own but we got cold & wet & needed hot drinks. Could have spent more time in White Tower, will have to return. Used 2:1 entry offer by going by train, saved £30. Very well organised. Great day"
"January 9, 2020",A great morning - the beefeater tour a must.,"My teen enjoyed the beefeater tour immensely - she described it as engaging & entertaining and admitted she learnt a lot!Our beefeater tour guide, Scott Kelly, was both entertaining and engaging as well as amusing and informative. He spoke clearly and loudly allowing everyone to hear and enjoy without straining.The 2nd highlight were the Crown Jewels, and being January there were no queues so we could take our time to enjoy and appreciate them."
"February 27, 2020",SO glad I rang up beforehand to ask which tour to do.... saved a lot of money and got to see it all!,"We were taking 2 American friends to the Tower so I wanted the best deal.. so many websites! so I rang the Tower directly.. told, book on line directly with Tower website, you save money, time (don't need to queue to change your ticket over before entering) and Beefeater tour is free any how!Due to very noticeable lack of tourists in London at the moment we walked straight in! the 'boys' had a long and very informative talk with 2 of the very friendly and knowledgable Beefeaters, we walked around the Crown Jewels display with only about a dozen or so others! so we just took our time looking at them all more than once.  Apart from one local school group in the White Tower, that was very easy to walk around and see everything in it.More people had arrived by 11.30am so we went and had a very tasty soup and bread snack lunch and one of the jam tarts with crown stencil in icing sugar on... we couldn't resist! not overly priced at all.   The loos were very clean as well!We then walked around the other areas at a very nice leisurely pace.  We enjoyed the Walter Raleigh moving projection in his cell.We were there over 3 hours and if we hadn't booked to go over Tower Bridge we'd have stayed longer.I'd not been for decades... it was a real treat to go back as a mature adult and see it all again.... fabulous place to visit.. so much history to impart and somewhere our American friends found fascinating and immensely enjoyable to go!"
"January 2, 2020",Historical Brilliance,If you’re interested in the history of this country and what came before then this is such a brilliant venue to visit.The staff are absolutely fantastic at painting a story of life in those times the crown Jules exhibition is absolutely fantastic and well worth queueing to see.We loved the ravens and the story behind them.We should be very proud of our country and our history and the progression that we have made forwards the royal family is a very important part of our history and our future.The Tower of London stories I’ve just fantastic and a very Walls is steeped in history.
"May 3, 2020",Beautiful castle ,"Who wouldn’t want to come here and explore the old prison and see the crown jewels? We came on Sunday afternoon what was but pity because we couldn’t enjoy their restaurant for too long as they close the castle quite early so we had to hurry to see everything. But as we have the membership card we will definitely come back. Inside you can see also the armours, prison, medieval dresses and have the audio guide who explain everything. "
"January 26, 2020",So much history!,"We only spent several hours at Tower of London as we had afternoon tickets to Westminster Abbey.  We could have easily spent a good part of the day at TOL. There is so much history and storytelling.  It was also raining the day we went so our Beefeater tour was held in the chapel but that was okay by me - I really wanted to see where Anne Boleyn is buried and she’s in there.  Definitely do a Beefeater tour - they are incredibly informative and entertaining.  The Crown Jewels are like nothing you’ll ever see in your life - go straight there if you have morning tickets to beat the crowds and you can view them a few times. Henry VIII’s armour is a sight to see, as well.  Buy your tickets online, get a bit of a discount and order the guidebook at the same time to also save a bit of money.  The only place you can’t take photos is in the Chapel.  Also, be careful of the steps inside the White Tower (especially the medieval punishment section) if you’ve been out in the rain. My husband slipped due to wet shoes.  We had an awesome time at the Tower and hope to spend a lot longer there next time.  "
"September 2, 2020",Amazing attraction - and so quiet,"Visited the Tower on Monday, first time for all but my wife. Thanks to COVID-19 (one tiny positive), it was very quiet with a maximum of 2,500 visitors that day vs the usual 14-15,000 in August. Amazing place and the Beefeaters/Yeomen Warders were so friendly and happy to tell us more about the exhibits, their experiences etc. It’s a shame to see London so quiet but, selfishly, made our visit extra special as no fighting with the crowds. Highly recommended."
"April 20, 2022",Long lines,I really feel like they sell too many tickets for this experience.  The amount of people and the amount of lines and just feeling like you're being herded like cattle make the experience not worth it.  We didn't even get to see the Crown Jewels because the line was so long.  I would not recommend this experience to anyone who wants a relaxed time - it's more stressful and crowded.The talk that the worker gave in the middle of the square was probably the best part of the whole experience.
"March 21, 2023",Fun Day and the Tower,"What a wonderful day at the Tower of London! This was by far my favorite place to visit. It is filled with interesting history and fascinating stories. It is the prefect spot for the entire family or any group. They have interactive museum exhibits for the younger children to help engage in the content, along with plenty of video narration  for those who want to keep a brisk pace. I would definitely recommend purchasing the audio guide which will set you back about 5 pounds. Note- this  is a tower and so there are steps stairs everywhere."
"September 8, 2020",  A Magnificent Setting,"  Situated just behind the Thames river,  the tower  commands impresive views of Tower Bridge, and the more modern skyscrapers.  A mere ten minute walk from Tower Hill tube station, you just follow the signs around & down the side, to the entrance.  You enter across the moat, and work your way up to Traitors Gate.  You can stop off to get a free map / a reasonably priced guide book.  Both the entrance ticket and guide book, need to be booked in advance; for social diatancing numbers.  The smaller areas of the palace are cordoned off, but there is still a lot to see.  The medieval expense of the bedchamber and chapel of St Peter ad Vincula, show the different fabrics used by royalty.  This contrasts sharply with the small plain chapel, and leads sharply on to the executions area.     Most people (inculding myself), go onto the White Tower next; built by William the Conquer.   Here you see the brutality of the middle ages, with a marvellous armoury collection.  Later leading to mixed weapons, such as the mace gun; and then jewelled weapons (both donated and confiscated).  This leads to the Crown Jewels, with its own escalator to take you past the main collection. The slowest escalator in London!  Other interesting bits to see are the Grenadier Guards, with their bearskin hats.  The guards drill on the sound of the chimes, with another guard down the far end.  Be sure to keep your hands to yourself, as the one Grenadier shouted out 'off the trees.'  They used to keep animals under ground in cages, as well as people in the dungeons.    None of the water fountains are on, due to the pandemic;  but there is a icecream seller as you come out the Crown Jewels building.  There's also a cafè, and three gift shops, as well as giant ravens in and out of their cage.  It'll take over an hour and a half, to two hours to get around; with many winding steps.  It's great to see, and I would do it again.  If you want to go to other palaces, you can upgrade your ticket, to an annual membership.  This'll give you access to six palaces (not all in London), for a year.  You can do this upto two weeks after you buy a regular ticket."
"January 2, 2020",Thank goodness for Horrible Histories and the wonderful Tower of London!,"Family visiting from Norfolk and this included an eleven and eight year old.  Needed somewhere to keep them occupied for the day. I’d visited the Tower many times in the past but not recently.  It was so good to see it was as popular as ever and I’d warned family there will be a lot of people, so expect queues.   We didn’t join any of the beefeater tours as we had our guide books and we knew that the kids (fans of Horrible Histories) wanted to see the chopping block on the green, and the tower where prisoners were incarcerated (their words!) and of course Traitors’ Gate.  They were fascinated by the prison walls filled with prisoners’ names and comments, and the Crown Jewels, after quite a wait (time went quickly by spending with it with Q&As) were spectacular.No time limit so we spent most of the day there and weather was glorious  - we’d taken food and drinks so only needed to spend money on additional snacks and items from the gift shop.It’s such a shame that some reviewers have given this venue 1 star for reasons no related to it - one even had a run in with TfL staff and reviewed it on THIS site!"
"August 25, 2023",Always a good experience,"As a local, I’ve been to the Tower of London many times over the last 20 years and I always have a good experience. This time I took my children for the first time and it didn’t disappoint. I highly recommend the Yeoman Warder tour, which is included in the ticket price and starts every 30 mins, to help get your bearings and learn about some of the gruesome history of the Tower. The other “must see” is the Crown Jewels as well as the chapel.  The queue to see the jewels is always long but it moves fast so what looked like an hour wait actually took around 20 mins. This time we only spent 2 hours here due to kids’ attention span, but we have stayed longer in the past when in adult company. Ticket price is not cheap, but compared to other London attractions gives relatively good value. (The gift shops, on the other hand, are outrageously priced)This is definitely worth visiting if you are on a tight schedule and want to fit as much British culture into your itinerary as possible."
"February 22, 2020",Great piece of history,"The tours of the tower are great and delivered by Beefeaters who are passionate about history. It really helps bring the place to life. The crown jewels are a great place to visit, it's a piece of living history right before your eyes."
"February 2, 2020",A Must See!,"I work in the museum field in the US and I think this was the best tour guide I have ever had the pleasure of guiding me through history.  Our beefeater was simply amazing.  Funny, knowledgeable, personable, and did I mention hilarious?  Just a fantastic tour.  Keep up the amazing work you are doing to tell such incredible stories from history.  I highly recommend for anyone and everyone."
"July 4, 2021",Best part of London,"A treasure trove of history surrounded by the modern world, the tower was the best part of my London trip.I would recommend getting there for the opening of the the gates to see the royal guard and the beefeaters perform their ceremony, and on any trip there you need to go to the crown jewels as your first stop. I was lucky to get right in but the line does build up quickly.The Fusiliers museums and white tower were both splendid with armours from the past"
"August 26, 2020",Still inordinately long queues for the Crown Jewels,"This is the time to visit such attractions as the Tower of London they said. The prospect of much shorter queues than usual because of the current shortage of tourists both from overseas as well as home-grown. Perhaps too many heard such news because apart from little to no queuing to get in the main entrance the queues to access the Crown Jewels this afternoon wound several times in front of the building housing them before heading downhill for about half a mile. Fortunately the queue for the armour collection in the White Tower was shorter than usual but some upper floors were, I think, closed."
"August 14, 2023",A London Must See,"The Tower of London complex is a fascinating place and somewhere you must visit while in London. The place is quite sprawling, with multiple buildings and other structures worth exploring. The best way to attend is via an online ticket, which gets you into the complex and allows access to everything, including the Crown Jewels. Also included is an excellent audio guide, which is quite valuable in navigating the rather large space. Be sure and take advantage of the Yeoman Warder (Beefeater) tours. The Warders deliver an informative and entertaining history of the Tower. Note that these tours commence every half hour just inside the Tower entrance and are included in your entry ticket. Here are a few other notes. The Crown Jewels queue can be VERY long, up to a couple of hours, so try and go either early or late. They feature a nice cafe and a couple of gift shops. The Tower Bridge is a short walk away, so you can see the bridge right before or after your day at the Tower. I'd budget a minimum of 4 hours if you want to take in most of what the Tower site has to offer."
"May 23, 2021",Living History.. ,"As historic venues go, there's few to beat the Tower of London. With a date range of active service from its origins in 1080, through to its present day roles, there's a lot of history to explore.There's been a lot of improvements to the venue over the years and now, in the age of Covid, it's a wonderfully well managed place.Social Distancing is implemented, online bookings required and lots of sanitizing stations available.Masks are required in all indoor spaces.The displays are well organized, laid out and lots of information about each exhibit.The Tower remains an absorbing, intriguing attraction and continues to fascinate and entertain. "
"January 5, 2020",Amazing Historic Insight,"Had an entertaining time visiting the Tower of London 4/1/20. It was a fascinating insight into the amazing and often shocking history of London. Yeoman Warden 409 Scotts’ commentary of the events was both informative and entertaining as he sought to involve us in his talk. He even encouraged us to learn more about the history with our own research, something I know I will be doing. I actually would have liked a longer tour with more insight, more information. The Crown Jewels were breathtakingly beautiful.I would highly recommend this visit to everyone, age is no limit"
"August 4, 2021",Step back into history,"Fantastic tour of The Tower of London. I was worried whether it would be worth the cost, but it definitely was. The Beefeater who conducted our tour was fantastic, really bought the site to life with his stories and facts about the tower. The stewards are all so friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend this for children over the age of 7. "
"January 18, 2020",Brilliant family afternoon ,"Spent much longer here than we anticipated, so much to see and do. Something to fascinate all ages. Did not expect it to have a village feel. Loved the Beefeater tour, they paint an especially colourful story and get the children involved. "
"January 2, 2020",700 Years of History in One Night,We were lucky enough to get tickets to watch the Ceremony of the Keys. To think this has been going on every night in one form or another for 700 years is astonishing. We feel really privileged to see the Yeomen and honour guard perform this function. Photography was not allowed of the actual ceremony. 
"February 16, 2020",Great day out,Fascinating insight into the gruesome & brutal history of theroyals and royal visitors at the Tower. The weather was appalling sadly and much of the tour was outside so we got soaked but the day was still very worthwhile. The Yeomen / Beefeater tour guides were very entertaining whilst at the same time delivering detailed accounts of history. Recommended! 
"January 20, 2020",Love this place!,"As a Londoner, I’ve visited the Tower of London on more than several occasions over the years. Most recently when I had family over from Spain and decided to take them out to the Tower and the surrounding area for the day in December 2019. We joined one of the Yeoman tours which is hugely worthwhile if you understand English as it really brings history to life. They are always highly informative and entertaining! I love the atmosphere of the Tower and the fact that you can walk around at your leisure, stop for food etc. We went on a weekday and it didn’t appear very busy. Able to see the Crown Jewels and all the other displays without needing to queue. You can easily spend 3-4 hours here. The Tower of London is probably one of my most favourite London attractions and would definitely recommend a visit!"
"January 9, 2020",Beefeater tour was hilarious!,"We joined a beefeater tour and it was such a delight.  We spent the hour learning and laughing.  My kids loved the history lesson presented in such a fun and lively way.  The Crown Jewels were quite crowded but they had a moving sidewalk that kept everyone with a limited amount of time.  The white Tower was filled with things to see and do.  It is a very expensive place to visit, but a definite must.  "
"November 30, 2021",Can I live here? Asking for a friend,"My favorite attraction by far in London. I could spend all day here - listening to the audio guide and stalking each of the Yeoman Warders. The White Chapel is in incredible condition for being 1000 years old. You can walk through, view the exhibits (some of which even interactive) and learn about the history of the first castle. Obviously, the crown jewels are the piece de resistance. They are truly remarkable to behold in person.The Yeoman Warders are delightful and tell the story of the Tower with great personality. They are funny, knowledgeable and take great pride in their role. After all, in order to be a warder, they had to serve over 20 years of military service. This is a must go, and try to go in the morning when there are fewer people. Make a beeline to the crown jewels and you can see them close up."
"March 31, 2022",Great to do once!,"If you’re visiting London and haven’t done this attraction. It’s a good one to do!Plenty of history and sights to see. Despite not being religious, my favourite experience was actually seeing the Church of St Peter,  as it’s the final resting place of Anne Boleyn. There was a beefeater patrolling inside who took time to speak to us and it was a really nice conversation.There is no doubt MUCH to see and learn and it really is fantastic if you like your British history. However…The reason I gave four stars is because the ticket prices were quite high for what it was in my opinion. And I am also not a supporter of them clipping the wings of the ravens just to force them to stay."
"August 11, 2021",Well worth and should visit if in London,"Great day out, the beef eaters really make this experience work, not bad when you consider that this is their home. Easy arrival, (pre booking was required and timed entry) but worked very well. The talk with the beef eaters is a must and Colin who did ours (his first in 15 months )was brilliant, he bought the history alive and gave our visit content. The chapel is very moving and of course the Crown Jewels. Food options were good and lots of areas to sit and enjoy a picnic, watch your food one of the ravens had a packet of crisps off somebody before they could react. Shop had the usual tack as well as some well thought out lines to buy. Can get busy and a couple of areas have a challenging access route, hardly surprising when you take in to what the site is."
"February 24, 2021",A brilliant place but too much rain ,"The tower is possibly my most favourite place to visit and it still is but we didn’t have a great visit last time. This was not due to anyones fault but the weather was appalling. It was heavy, continuous torrential rain and there was no indoor seating available and the outdoor cafe was just doing takeaway drinks. Our shoes had to be thrown away after our visit. It was such a shame as we had booked our tickets so far in advance online. We will just have to go again when all of the restrictions are over "
"March 1, 2020",Interesting,"It’s always very busy whenever you go, usually heaving in fact. Nearly all the loos closed for maintenance which isn’t great planning. Cafe is hideous. My youngest (5) got shouted at by a guard for leaning over a fence. No signs saying do not touch or do not lean over, suspect it was for the theatre but he was very upset. He wears it like a badge of honour now though."
"January 9, 2020",Sight seeing ,Great place of history. Expect to climb a lot of stairs if you wish to see everything. Go early and see the jewels with very little wait. Any time if the year go early and there will be less people. Listen to a beefeater tour they have so much personality and are fun and knowledgeable. A must see if you have never been to London. 
"June 6, 2021",Brilliant visit but Covid brings mixed blessings,"I’m torn.We visited at 9.30am in half term. Had a brilliant visit in spite of the rain.  We pretty much had the place to ourselves but that was the excellent and sad at the same time. The lack of tourists means that we could walk round the Crown Jewels and other exhibits over and over with no pushing or jostling but the place generally felt a bit sad.  Also, the Yeoman warders couldn’t give their usual tours and that was a big loss.Hence, we went round pinching ourselves at how much space and time we had there but also with a tinge of sadness that it needs more people to visit."
"January 8, 2020",New Years Eve in the Tower,"Visited the Tower of London New Years Eve morning. The weather was cold, wet and windy. The venue was heaving, too many people, no trail to follow so crowds drifting from one part to another. The queue for the Crown Jewels was never less than one and a half hours long, mostly 2 hours plus so waiting in the rain ( and it was only drizzling!) was no fun so we didn't bother. Too many people at the attraction so were in queues most of the time. Needs some sort of organising so visitors have a route to follow."
"January 5, 2020",Tower of London,"Wow, amazing how much history is packed into one place. So glad it survived the London fires and WWII.  We hired a private tour guide which was a great addition for a family trip. He added additional commentary and our kids were able to ask additional questions which I think helped their enjoyment and understanding."
"May 20, 2021",Fabulous day,"Came here with a friend the day after it had opened from COVID and it was brilliant. Very clean, very quiet and very friendly.We used an audio guide and though we didn’t really need it as most of the info was written on boards around the museum it was still useful.We really loved looking at the Crown Jewels they were stunning and the atmosphere in there was very calming.Everyone we encountered were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We spent around 4 hours here and got all the information we needed. I particularly loved spotting all the yeomans houses and the keys pub that they have onsite. Big fan since watching the Tower of London documentary.This place is a must for anyone visiting London."
"February 4, 2020","Interesting, but....","We spent about 3 hours looking round and didn’t get bored. We had a 50 minute tour from one of the yeoman, and then wandered round by ourselves. Lots to see, but be warned some places have very narrow, winding staircases to climb up and down. My only criticism is that there is practically no interactive content in the Tower (just one bit were you can try on a hat and touch chain mail). In that sense it felt a bit dated as a tourist attraction.It’s easy to buy tickets at the booths just outside the entrance, but it is a bit cheaper if you buy online. "
"June 22, 2022",Superblooms at the tower,"Visited to see the wildflowers in the moat. It was beautiful- pinks, purples,blues,oranges,reds all colours just a carpet of changing hues. Then in to the tower itself. Could easily spend all day looking around. Just one small grumble- after finishing the walk through the flowers you then have to join the queue to enter the tower. "
"January 27, 2020",Worth visiting,It was a bit cold on the day I visited the site but it does worth it. See the building and history of london over a thousand years by going around the tower of london. I was able to come across a live drama of the king in the king's room. The crown jewel and the armor display are both cannot be missed. It is better to arrive earlier as I arrive around noon and not able to go through all the tours when it closed.
"October 24, 2020",Enjoy the space and sights!,"One of the strange upsides to visiting during these ‘Covid’ times is the lack of fellow visitors. If you’ve ever wanted to enjoy the Tower and all it’s history now is that time. We visited today, 11am on Saturday 24th October and enjoyed unrivalled access to many of the towers, grounds and of course the Crown Jewels. To visit these normally requires extended queuing, crowds and bustle with no time to enjoy. Today we could spend as long we wanted admiring royal treasures dating from centuries long past. The ability to stop and chat with unhurried and friendly Yeoman Warders was well worth the effort, they’ve always got tales to tell!Go while you can and enjoy the limited visitors and leisurely pace and progress around the Palace!"
"April 11, 2020",More than what we expect,It was one of the attractions included in the London pass. We have no regret to visit it as it was more than what we expect. The historical site  is rather big and we spent an hours plus to just walked around. All the buildings were really well maintained and in its original shape. We actually just a small group of people where there was tour guide  explaining the history of the building. Very interesting. Worth the time we spent there.
"July 9, 2023",Just Wow,"First of all, just wow. This was a fantastic day out in London and was well worth the price. We got there early with little to no queue to get into the place which was ideal. You would definitely need the whole day to properly go and look at all the magnificent displays and buildings on offer here. Unfortunately, we decided not to have a yeoman warder tour, which was completely a wrong choice as I have heard their tours are outstanding, so I would recommend waiting for the tour guide and going round with them before venturing off and finding your way around. Once you step into the buildings, it takes you straight back through the past, they are surprisingly well kept and very well preserved. The crown jewels were an absolute marvel to look at, though the line was long it moved very quickly. Overall, a spectacular day and will be coming again to have a proper tour."
"December 30, 2022",To many visitors admitted,"Even though we pre-booked tickets, we had to queue for 30 minutes to get entry. To see the Crown Jewels would have required another 60 minutes queuing with no timed access. Overall they had admitted far too many people and all of the exhibits were overrun and difficult to see."
"August 28, 2021",Worth a visit,"Have been wanting to go for a number of years and was very happy that we went. Was made to feel very welcome and all the beefeaters were friendly and happy to chat. I felt that the to the staff this was not just a job but a passion and they wanted to be there, this was evident to how they served the guests with humour and a smile. The only things that could made quicker was the queue to the Crown Jewels and the restaurant only took cards cash not allowed, not made clear until you are at the till with trays full of food.I would like to thank all the staff for making everyone welcome please keep it up you are appreciated by us guests."
"October 23, 2022",The best thing to do in London,"Our Yeoman Tour guide was one of the best guys I’ve had anywhere ever. The tours, which are included in admission, start every 30 to 45 minutes. My group was lucky enough to get Shandy (or maybe it was Shady).   The tours last about 45 minutes and I ended up spending about six hours walking around the grounds. For me, it’s the best thing to do in London."
"August 15, 2021",Well worth a visit,"We only had a few hours, would highly recommend to anyone. If you visit? Make sure you go on a beefeater tour - ours was Barry Stringer, he was extremely knowledgeable, passionate about what he does and added humour along the tour. Also a mention to Louisa, who also had passion for what she does and the knowledge she has is brilliant. The only downside to this visit? Was the queues for a coffee, it needs better organisation, I felt sorry for the guy serving us under extreme pressure and people stood there tutting because they had to wait. Other than that? Great day out for all"
"February 24, 2021",A brilliant place but too much rain ,"The tower is possibly my most favourite place to visit and it still is but we didn’t have a great visit last time. This was not due to anyones fault but the weather was appalling.

Any time if the year go early and there will be less people. Listen to a beefeater tour they have so much personality and are fun and knowledgeable. A must see if you have never been to London. 
"December 28, 2022",Great tour as always,"Took the beefeater tour 10 years ago and loved it and did it with a friend again this time and it's still one of the most entertaining tours. We had Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly for our guide and he's great! He gave special attention to all the kids on the tour, which I'm sure made their day.Line for tickets across the way was very long and a bit confusing as there were ticket booths for other sights in the area as well. But once you have a ticket, there wasn't a line for entrance into the tower. Crown Jewels was also not super busy the day I went.All the yeomen and other people who work in here were really responsive to random questions about the place and history and were very knowledgeable with answers!"
"September 13, 2021",Tower tales,I have been wanting to visit for years and finally got the chance. Amazing place the only negative is the ticket price. We had a most amazing tour by Yeomen Scott-Kelly 409 who brought the tower to life with his great explanation and fun talk of the life in the tower over the decades. Highly recommended to listen to the tour guide tales as makes it more real and you can appreciate the history more.  Lots of areas to investigate and gain knowledge.
"January 30, 2020",Never tire of the Tower,"Every visit to see family includes the Tower (they aren't actually IN the tower).  I could probably do the tours myself after so many visits, but I never miss it.  Where to start?  Well, every day is busy there, so start early.  Just to sit and look at the wonderful history is enough, but seeing just how amazing each building is from the inside should not be missed.   The Crown Jewels lines are usually long, but move fast.  Take a walk around the front of the Tower along the river...with the magnificent Tower Bridge before you.After your visit, catch the Thames Clipper back to Westminster, or start your trip to the Tower from Westminster and enjoy the views."
"July 29, 2020",second great visit to the tower of london,we had a gret second visit here with our historical castles and palaces ticket. Each place we visited and each talk we had was fascinating. The beefeaters were humerous and facilitating and stimulated the imagination. the food was tasty the exhibits well presented and glorious and ravens present! much to be recommended.
"July 16, 2020",Not for children under school age ,"I have to say, despite best efforts, I was a little disappointed here. The castle grounds were immaculate and the staff wonderful, however the entire experience was just so dull! I am a big lover of history, but this place was stuffy and boring, it’s not curated well and brought nothing to life. Nothing interactive whatsoever. Most rooms/parts were closed due to Covid, which is understandable so we could have missed something. If so, my apologies. I thought there might be interactive displays or video clips detailing the history or something to give the castle more context. Instead there were just dull text panels which are aimed at adults really. It’s a shame. This was my first visit to the place and I’ve lived in London all my life. Brought my 4 year old as he’s obsessed with castles, knights at the moment. He enjoyed seeing the armour. Also a note to say the way they have organised things in response to Covid is admirable, they’ve done a great job! If you haven’t been and always wanted to visit do so now as there were hardly any people and no crowds/queues at all. "
"August 28, 2020",An absolute gem of a place.....,"Visited today, with a 10am pre-booked ticket. It was eerily quiet, but we obviously took advantage of the shorter queues and limited numbers.We've walked past the Tower of London numerous times, on numerous previous visits, but the crowds always put me off, so today was perfect.I absolutely loved the visit. Fascinating, quirky, and the Yeoman Warders were fabulous. The Crown Jewels were utterly stunning, and almost worth the admission fee alone. Loved reading about our amazing history, and interesting past. My teenage boys were interested too, and enjoyed the suits of armour in the White Tower. Well wirth a visit, especially with reduced numbers. We left at 1 and most places had queues to get in."
"February 4, 2020",Yeoman Warder Terry Briggs a complete star,"We managed to tag onto a Beefeater tour that had just started and were very lucky to have Terry Briggs as our guide.Fascinating facts about the Tower delivered with a great sense of humour.Top bloke and a credit to the Tower of London experience.The crown jewels are very impressive. One of the exhibits explains the diamond, history and how they cut it etc.Probably spent 3hrs at the Tower. (thought the food was a bit pricey)Arrived via Thames Clipper which is a great way to see London."
"October 29, 2022",History by the bucketload,"Despite being a busy half term Friday we enjoyed our Tower visit. It was well organised, in terms of queues and managing people and although very busy it did not feel uncontrolled or unmanageable  at any point. The sheer history of the Tower is outstanding. To realise you are standing amongst something which has played a part in history for more than 900 years is absolutely staggering.There are a lot of stairs which isn’t ideal for those with limited mobility however accessibility wasn’t a thing hundreds of years ago :)Without a doubt the star attraction is the Crown Jewels.  Made all the more relevant by an upcoming coronation and recent events. Do not miss them. I would happily line up again just to see the Cullinan diamond.The chapel shouldn’t be missed either - the list of those interred there is a “who’s who” of historical figures. All in all not to be missed. I had no expectations but it’s fair to say I was blown away by what I saw and would visit again in a heartbeat."
"June 23, 2022",A brilliant day,"We recently visited the Tower of London and had the most brilliant day. We got there early which was great as it wasn’t too crowded and we avoided some of the long queues we saw later. The Crown Jewels were spectacular and the history in the various exhibitions and museums was mind blowing. The highlight of the day for us though was the Beefeater tour. Our Beefeater tour guide was Mark and he was absolutely fab. He was funny, knowledgeable and brought all the History of the Tower to life. We have been watching the TV series on the Tower which we have really enjoyed and seeing and speaking to some of the characters from the series was excellent. It’s no wonder the Tower is one of  the best sightseeing experiences in London it is well worth a visit. "
"November 4, 2021",A fantastic historical attraction.,"We booked online and got our dates muddled and turned up a day early it was sorted easily with no fuss. We joined Gary for the Beefeater tour and he was fantastic, enthusiastic, knowledgeable and funny. The queues on the day were non existent and getting around every area of interest was easy and hassle free. We saw all the main exhibits, the Crown Jewels, the White Tower, the Bloody Tower and time to get photographs with the Ravens. Well worth the money."
"November 18, 2023",Crown and Coronation Tour,Crown and Coronation Tour duration for tour is 9days. I went on the first evening. Son has a Nimbus Access Card which indicates unable to queue but staff did not give a toss! There is one queue for all and that’s it! God help you if tickets did not download to one’s mobile for showing to enter staff try to help but if not downloaded as they expect then not really interested! Stood my ground and eventually allowed in as I had prebooked early Oct! On entry colourful illuminates accompanied by dismal appropriate music. Many walls different features of the Crown Jewels and coronation history. Staff and a sole Beefeater were extremely helpful within the grounds as were the ground staff! Doing this tour was good for seeing the Crown Jewels at one’s leisure as not as busy as in the day and was able to take in the views and go around several times and have a good look. Learnt that it’s a criminal offence to photograph the Crown Jewels as a woman got reprimanded! Glad I experienced this tour but should it be done again next year won’t bother as found it colourful but bloody boring!!
"March 29, 2020","Take a day if you want, or just go early and see the jewels","We visited the Tower of London twice because we didn't know it was part of a tour we were doing and we had purchased tickets for a different day already. It's a good thing we did. By the time we arrived with the tour, the line to see the Crown Jewels was more than 2 hours long. We spent that time going through the buildings. Beware: Sometimes there is no way out but to go on...and on and on and... However, when we went back the next time, we went early and got right in line for the jewel exhibit and only had a 30-minute wait. We don't have much interest in British royalty, but it was well worth it. Gorgeous!"
"April 22, 2022",Not suitable for young children. Horrible queues and nothing interactive.,Don't visit with young children and/or in the school holidays. There is nothing interactive and horribly long queues for everything which takes away from any enjoyment. May well be worth it if you have older children and pay for a tour but for us it was a waste of quite a lot of money.
"February 28, 2020",Kohinoor Diamond,"Entrance fee is GBP 30 per person but its worth the price. There is SO MUCH of history in this place, its really amazing. Started with the White Tower by William the Conqueror who invaded in 1066. You need atleast half a day to cover MOST of this place. The crown jewels were really awesome and you can see the magnificent Kohinoor diamond here. Don't miss it."
"June 22, 2021",Exciting,This was my absolute FAVORITE thing we did in London. Absolutely do not miss out on a tour here. A beefeater who lives within the Tower of London led our tour and made it an absolute blast. Everything he shared was fascinating and his fun sense of humor had everyone laughing throughout.The Crown Jewels are kept in the Tower of London and I could hardly believe that I was standing in front of all of them at one point. Don't skip the tour -- it added so much value and knowledge to the whole experience.
"May 2, 2023",This place is AMAZING!!!,"The Tower of London is so much more than just a tower.  It is a whole city behind walls with a rice and fascinating history!  Tickets give you access to a self-guided audio tour, which is an absolute must.  We could easily have spent all day here, and there is a cafe where you can eat lunch, but sadly, we needed to head out shortly after noon.  The audio tour is done wonderfully and allows you to find out as little or as much as you want to know, while moving at your own pace.  Enjoyed seeing the crown jewels, visiting the White Castle and seeing all the suites of armor on display, and so much more.  A must if you are visiting London!"
"March 1, 2020",So much to see!,Great palace tour for your London itinerary. Highly recommend the add-on audio tour to help guide you through the site. Activities and exhibits for both kids and adults. Plan to spend at least 3 hours to see it all - we went on a Sunday morning   and crowds were minimal.
"February 3, 2020",Amazing,"Easily my favourite attraction in London. I can't speak highly enough of it and could spend all day listing the seperate aspects and what I loved about them.Suffice to say, just go. If you've never been, just go."
"May 20, 2022",Beefy experience of the Tower of London,"We visited the Tower of London with our 10 year old granddaughter (Lisa) and decided to take advantage of the 45 minute tour provided by one of the Beefeaters. Beefy409 was our guide, and what a great break for us.  We was engaging and humorous, while providing great insight into the history of the Tower. He made sure that our granddaughter was involved and learned along the way. Great experience was had by all of us  thanks to Beefy409."
"August 23, 2021",Well worth the money,"You go to the Tower primarily to see the Crown Jewels. They are beautifully presented and it is amazing how close you can get to them. They are well-lit, which makes the jewels sparkle. We visited on a Sunday morning in August 21, so there weren't many international tourists so we walked straight in and spent a long time looking at the jewels without crowds; looking at the queuing system in place I think it must get quite busy.The rest of the grounds are good too- I was surprised at how much you get to look around.Many of the Warders are very friendly and helpful but I think some of them are a bit 'clever' and full of themselves. One of them scoffed at my daughter's request for directions as it appeared obvious, but when he realised he was in the wrong because of the Tower's Covid restrictions in place, he 'wound his neck in', to use a military expression."
"September 15, 2022",A London must see!,"I originally thought the Tower of London was just a tower...actually one of the towers holding up the tower bridge.  I could not have been farther from the truth.  It is a fortress and  former royal residence that holds within it a concentrated dose of everything British.  It has history, tradition, jewels and very helpful Yeoman Warders to tell its story.  Our visit was just two days before the death of Queen Elizabeth II, so much of what we saw was poignant and moving."
"March 7, 2020",Behind the walls of history ,"So much history behind the walls of the London Tower. There are so many different areas that you can go in visit. The Crown Jewels were amazing to see in person. There are tickets booths all over the place for this place, if you’re a student remember your student card you get a discount!"
"June 8, 2023",Recommend getting in early,"We visited the Tower of London on a cold (cold by Australian definition) Monday morning during a school term. We arrived at 9.15am to line up for a 10am opening. Lucky we did because the line was right across the square by 9.30am. Tickets were scanned and maps handed out while we were waiting for the gates to open which made entry quite quick. We opted for an audio self guided tour which did add value and was worth it. We headed straight to the Crown Jewels upon entry. I don’t think my expectations were in check because I expected more from the Jewels. There wasn’t as much on display as I expected, which was more tiaras and jewellery. It took us a while to get through the Crown Jewels as there was lots of people and it was dark. By the time we got out the line to get in filled the stanchions. The actual Tower itself was interesting, particularly where prisoners were kept; the armoury was also quite interesting and there was much more on display than just armour; the towers with the Beefeater display which included insights into their training and background was worth a visit; and the talks around the place with the Beefeaters also looked quite engaging. Unfortunately we only had two hours here as we had another tour to get to. Would recommend at least 3-4 hours on a warm day."
"August 7, 2022",Enjoyed Superbloom,Enjoyed the superbloom wild flowers walk around the Tower.  We didn't pay to go in the tower but enjoyed listening to the guide giving tours of the tower as we entered the flower area and would think about doing that in future.  You can see the flowers for free from the road above the tower entrance but it was nice to walk in amongst the flowers.
"August 4, 2021",Tower of London Tri,"So much history to be part of. My granddaughter really enjoyed herself and so did I. I had watched the series on TV and just  had to visit. The Yeoman who gave us our tour experience was so funny and descriptive of the torture and murders that have been commited over time. The restaurant food was very satisfying and very clean, good service provided. The Ravens were very talkative as they flew around the Tower. A top Ten place to visit."
"January 11, 2020",A must see location,Visited on a midweek day in January and really enjoyed the experience. Really felt part of the atmosphere that has accumulated over the centuries. Appreciated that it wasn’t too crowded and managed to see everything. Arrived at 12:30 due to our off peak train times and wanting to use the 2 for 1 voucher and were still exploring when the wardens started locking up at 4:30. Cannot recommend it enough.
"January 25, 2020",Yeoman Warder Tour and Crown Jewels,"We spent about half a day at the Tower of London and could have easily spent more time if we hadn’t saved it for the second half of the day.  The Yeoman Warder tour was amazing: very informative and our YW had an excellent sense of humor (“ask me anything except about the Ravenmaster,” he told us, before taking a jab of conjured jealousy at his more famous colleague - he later doubled back on that and told us that there were such things as stupid questions, recalling a story of such a question a few years before).  The line for the Crown Jewels was surprisingly short and we were able to go straight in to see these valuable and beautiful symbols of British royalty.  We also very much enjoyed walking the walls and going inside towers that once held famous prisoners - you can even see messages those prisoners carved into the walls.  Absolutely amazing!"
"May 25, 2022",London Icon,A wonderful iconic site to visit in London.  They have regular guided tours by the Beefeaters relaying all the history of the Tower & its former occupants.  A glance of the crown jewels is a bonus.  We were there when they fired the cannons too.
"January 27, 2022",Go now whilst its quiet!,"We visited here whilst it was quiet (I'd walked past a few days previously and asked one of their guides how busy they were and they told me they were very quiet so we decided to take a day off and visit a few days later). The Yeoman Warder's tour was excellent (well done Beefy!) just the right mix of humour and fun alongside the historical facts. We also learned something new about the Crown Jewells from one of the guides which were brilliant. We ended up getting the season pass as we want to go back in the summer and we cant wait to visit Hampton Court, Kew, and Banquetting House. "
"January 5, 2020",Disappointed with the level of interpretation,"I hate to say it but I was disappointed. The building is of course awe inspiring but the interpretation within is dull. We went straight in with our Hisoric Royal Palaces and so did not see whether there was an audio tour available but once inside there was so much reading that you missed the feel of the place. Even in the prison area it was just reading, which with so many people was not easy to do as could not get near to the signs. The best bit of interpretation about prisoners was just seeing Walter Raleigh’s area and what it would have been furnished like.The White Tower was the biggest disappointment as, amazing though it is on the outside, inside is just the Armoury. I was hoping for at least a bit of a view of how the Kings and Queens would have lived.The best bit of our day was listening to Yeoman Warden 409 Scott ? On the Yeoman Warden Tour as without his stories and information we would have not have got a feel for the history of the place."
"March 2, 2020",Interesting but not worth the expense,"I'd been to the Tower years ago traveling alone. I thought that bringing my kids would be a great way to introduce them to the city. For the cost of the tickets, it was a silly choice. The grounds are beautiful but for as much as there is to the place, there isn't much to see. Spend your money elsewhere or visit a free museum."
"January 4, 2020",Cracking day out,"It's a full days outing this one. Start with the included tour by the warders, who are all larger than life wannabe actors! Lots of history lots to see. Plenty of walking and steps. Wear sensible footwear. Prices inside very reasonable. Expect queues to see the baubles which are better in real life than any photo. Child friendly with a big cafe. Limited toilets so plan ahead when going round. Can get very busy so go early. "
"November 6, 2022",Priceless experience,"The Tower of London is a great place to spend a few hours learning about the history of London and the Royal family. Starting with a fantastic tour from Beefeater 409, who clearly has a passion for The Tower of London and the history it holds, to looking around the buildings that hold so much history. It was particularly special to see the Crown jewls so close. The staff clearly do an amazing job at taking care of the grounds and give the public a priceless experience! Recommend to all :)"
"January 29, 2020",Beefeaters and Royal Guards,"The whole experience of the Tower of London is worth the time taken. From the colorful & handsome uniforms of the Beefeaters along with their stories of Historical events taking place there to passing the remains of the ancient Roman wall that the site was built on. I was startled by the ""frozen"" Royal Guards outside of the Crown Jewels display when the clock chimed and there was a changing of the Guards. They hadn't moved a wink beforehand and one literally could barely see them breath. So much discipline! And the exquisite beauty and majesty of the Crown Jewels are impressive. Again, well worth the time spent."
"July 22, 2022",A wonderful experience.,"We visited in July so that we could also visit Superbloom. It was quite surreal to sit in the moat of the Tower surrounded by flowers. Loved seeing the history of the Tower. There was a queue to see the Crown Jewels, but didn't have to wait long at all. It was very well organised and we loved the escalators to keep everyone moving by the Crown Jewels. One small observation - even though it clearly staed no photographs, there were people taking photos - which was disrespectful. What an incredible experience. It's well worth a visit!."
"January 1, 2023","Good visit, but go early to avoid crowds during high travel seasons","We got tickets using Headout and made sure to select the first time slot available that day. It was a very very busy day and this was the best thing I could have done. Highly recommend trying to catch a tour with one of the Yeoman Warders if lossible, even if it's shortened due to the rain as ours was it is still a lovely experience"
"July 16, 2022",It’s a big tourist attraction for good reason,"This was a big tourist attraction- and was well worth it.  We booked tickets for 10 am, which was ideal.  We missed the morning rush on the Tube.  It got much busier after we arrived.  We started to wander from building to building but realized that the crowd was growing so we got into a relatively short line to see the Crown Jewels.  By the time we finished and came back outside, the line was growing, and after we went to one other building, the line to the jewels was massive.  So, tip would be to arrive at 10 and go to see the jewels first.  The beefeaters were all over the place and were very interesting and funny tour guides.  The super bloom for the jubilee is a big wildflower planting in the moat.  You can see it just fine without the extra ticket (which lets you walk in the paths near the flowers). We grabbed lunch from one of the food trucks (from Uzbekistan - really tasty) and ate at a picnic table overlooking the Thames.  After the Tower, we took the tube (then changed to DLR) to Island Gardens and then walked thru the tunnel under the Thames to Greenwich.  Very cool experience."
"March 8, 2020",Exploring history,"Having watched the tv show, I wanted to see the Tower for myself. We had a wonderful time seeing and experiencing centuries of history for ourselves. We had a tour with Tower Warden Clive (he said to say his name was Phil if we didn’t enjoy it 😂) and despite him struggling with a cough, not Corvid-19 as he was keen to assure us; was loud, entertaining and knowledgable. Get well soon sir, and thank you for this morning. Well worth a visit. "
"August 26, 2020",Just brilliant ,"We spent a hugely enjoyable day in the Tower of London today. The fact that the tickets are for timed entry means that the queues are not too long and it is not too crowded. The signage is great, many parts are open and empty, and the Crown Jewels simply wonderful. This is an attraction in London that is worth every penny. The Beefeaters are the icing on the cake - really friendly and knowledgable. If you want a Covid safe, fun, clean, efficiently  run and totally fascinating historical attraction in London then this is the one!"
"August 4, 2022",Over crowded and long queues even with timed tickets,Disappointed that even with timed tickets the attraction was far too crowded to be enjoyed. Queues for crown jewels and bloody tower were well over an hour long each. Fewer tickets should have been available to maintain the safety and enjoyment of visitors. It was far better when managed under English Heritage. Making money rather than providing a good customer experience seems to be the priority
"August 28, 2022",Go Early to Avoid Crowds at the Tower of London,We purchased tickets ahead of time for the 9 a.m. opening of the Tower of London and arrived before opening. We avoided the crowds and did not experience any lines inside. We went without a guide but found that the workers inside the towers were very knowledgeable and were able to answer our questions.
"October 21, 2021",Great historical building (and no one lost their head),"What more could you ask for, Beefeaters, sentries wearing bear skins, Crown Jewels and so much moreIf your visiting and want historical England then a castle is a must on your trip.There will be queues and  bag searches but once through the gates you are transported back to yea olden times.Book a tour with a Beefeater or take the audio tour to make the most of your visitFrom torture chambers to Royal bedrooms there is so much to take inAllow at least 2 hours"
"November 20, 2022",Superbloom,"To celebrate the Queen's platinum jubilee, the moat surrounding the Tower of London was planted with flowers.  The event was called ""Superbloom"".  It was quite a sight to see the proliferation of beautiful flowers in what was once the moat.  Visitors received a flower guide so they could identify the flowers."
"July 9, 2022",Okay,"Superbloom and Tower of London.Fine, except that I was not able to buy my membership in any of the shops. One of the shops I went to said that the membership station wasn’t working and that I should go to the Tower of London Shop which is outside the ToL. I went there and was told that membership was not available to buy at that time.I came here today with every intention to buy a membership but it seems that you don’t actually need new members."
"February 24, 2020",An emotional but wonderful  experience,Came for the first time last year it had been on my bucket list for as long as I can remember and it’s all I expected and more I have a huge interested in the Tudor times and especially Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. The highlight of my visit had to be walking through the chapel where  Anne Boleyn is said to be buried it was so overwhelming and quite an emotional experience I feel something very close to Anne I don’t know why she’s just so interesting! I would’ve loved to of also seen the crown jewels but the queue was absolutely massive and I didn’t want to waste time stood in the queue and miss out on seeing everything else. Hopefully on my next visit I would actually love to do the tour where the yeoman warders tell you all the history of the tower and take you round the site.I will definitely be visiting her again sometime as I’m sure we missed out more than just the Crown Jewels.
"November 22, 2022",Brilliant,"We booked our tickets online (advisable) - went straight to the queue which had about 20 people in front of us 30 mins before they opened. Would advise going straight to the Crown jewel first, followed by the White Tower. We'd also pre-booked the audio tour which was good, the Yeoman Guards give tours every half hour and they get quite busy. We spent about 2.5 hours there and saw everything. The Yeomans were very helpful and friendly. Glad we went there."
"September 25, 2022",A tremendous amount of history plus the crown jewels,"There is a lot to see and do here!  It was very interesting to learn about the history of the tower, suggest getting the audio guides.  The crown jewels are a real treat to see, however no photo graphs are allowed of the crown jewels.  Go see the jewels first as the queue builds up quickly."
"November 5, 2022",Amazing place but visit disappointing,"Before I start this review, I would like to say as a history nerd and a mudlarker, the Tower is possibly my most favourite place to visit. I have been here a few times over the years but this last visit was a little disappointing. I admit half term isn't the best time to go but working in a school, unfortunately it had to be. The crowds were unbelievable, it was a constant shuffling along, not able to read any of the information because it was so packed. Didn't bother with the crown jewels as the queue was so long but that wasn't really an issue as I've seen them before. My main issue was even though the tickets are timed, it was still rammed....so the timed tickets seem pointless. Also I wanted to buy a beef eater xmas decoration but at £13.00 I thought again.....It seems a little greedy, particularly when it's nearly £30 per person to get in. I do want to reiterate, this is NOT a complaint about the Tower or its wonderful Beef eaters, I am still in awe of the place and its amazing history. I just would have liked a lot less people and maybe a little less expensive gift shop."
"May 31, 2022",Super Bare Lawn rather than Superbloom ,"The Tower of London is an amazing attraction however the wildflowers in the moat are a real let down at present. There is very little to see due to the cool weather and lack of rain. There are a number of signs giving information about the poor show and a great deal of effort has been expended trying to improve the situation but if you have booked tickets over the next week or two or more you are likely to be rather disappointed. The other thing to mention is the music which has been especially composed for the display. It is absolutely awful, being very depressing and completely unsuitable for what will eventually be (hopefully) an uplifting experience."
"September 19, 2021",Amazing,"The tour we had at the Tower of London was fantastic. The yeoman who guided us through was great, very knowledgable and engaging with lots of humour thrown into it too. Great views of Tower Bridge and the City of London are an added bonus. The information presented around the Tower of London is digestible and you learn a lot without it being overwhelming. A must-do if you’re in London for sure!"
"June 25, 2023",Very interesting!,So much to see here in addition to the Crown Jewels!  Really enjoyed walking around and learning more about the history.  Definitely get there early - we went to see the Crown Jewels first with a minimal line but by the time we came out of the exhibit the line was super-long!  We had lunch in the museum cafe - it was very crowded but the food was better than expected.
"August 27, 2023",A major London attraction not to be missed.,"After visiting London for decades, we eventually booked the Tower of London.Had such a fantastic day. Who wouldn't with all of the history, facts, stories and myths. Saw some of the 'stars' from the tv programme  especially the ravens! Plenty of toilets and cafes and I'd recommend the audio guide even though no one tells you it's full potential which makes it a bit footery and time wasting to begin with."
"October 8, 2020",Tower of London - overpriced ,"Overall there wasn’t much exciting to see except from the Crown Jewels whereby there was a massive queue just to see them for a space of 5 minutes. Extremely expensive and overpriced. I only spent half an hour if that there, and would say it is more suited to the older generation. "
"July 24, 2021",Great day for kids,Part of London’s heritage a great day out very affordable lots to see and lots for the kids to do  food services and fees are very affordable and a good standard. Lots of beefeaters to have snaps with the kids. Downside lots of stairs.  If you want gifts buy inside tower they are very good quality don’t but outside they are rip offs. Can of coke £2 ice lollies £3  enjoy a slice of English history you will enjoy it
"December 22, 2021",A great tour for someone who doesn't do history!,"I visited the Tower Of London with my 11 year old daughter. I'm not great at retaining knowledge of British history but the free guided tour, led by a Beefeater, was great and I listened with intent at the amazing history of this grand structure. The Crown jewels and armour were fascinating to see and facilities on site (toilets and cafe) were clean and cosy on a chilly winters day.I would recommend visiting."
"January 12, 2022",Brilliant,This was a last minute decision to go to the Tower of London and we are so glad we went.  We bought tickets and we got a discount by using my husbands Defence Service Discount so we were already onto a winner.  As we arrived a guided tour was just about to begin it was brilliant.  The yeoman warder whose name was Scott Kelly was so informative with his historical facts and hugely amusing that he made the tour a real treat.  We loved his humour it was very refreshing.  After the tour we wandered around the rest of the Tower and grounds and it was amazing.  There was no queue for the crown jewels we could wander at our leisure not sure what it would be like post covid and in the summer though.  Would definitely recommend everyone to go
"September 23, 2022","If you could only visit one location on your first trip to London, this is the place.","If you could only visit one location on your first trip to London, this is the place. One could literally spend two or three days here. I would certainly suggest at least 4-5 hours minimum. The Beefeater tour is free and fantastic from what I could tell (I am semi-handicapped, and would have never kept up with any tour). The architecture, the history, the art, even the dining room all make it a memorable experience."
"November 7, 2021",Wonderful day out,"We came for the first time and it was amazing, the walkways and different rooms are steeped in so much history. The Crown Jewels were gorgeous, absolutely incredible! I completely fell in love with the ravens too. All in all fantastic day! Will definitely return!!"
"April 5, 2022",Fantastic Day,Had a Fantastic visit with my 12 year old son.Very interesting we were there for almost 3 hours. The Yeoman beefy409 was fantastic with his tour he was very good with all the information he was giving and also with the kids he is so funny everyone seamed to love him.We will definitely be going back again.
"September 29, 2022",A super highlight!!,"For sure, one of the highlights of our trip. Have heard of the Tower of Landon and had to visit. Truly impressed with the history and artwork displayed, reflecting the many historic happenings over time. We did an audio tour, which was adequate."
"August 14, 2023",Wish I had more time to spend here,"We visited the Tower of London included in an Evan Evans tour. it was an all day tour and we saw very much, although the Tower was near the end of the day and we were pretty tired from all the walking and we had a boat ride on the Thames scheduled after the Tower. It appeared that we would not have enough time to see the Tower and do the boat ride, so we followed the advice of our Evan Evans guide and stood in line to see the Crown jewels which were worth seeing. As is the case with many locations, photography was not allowed, but it was well worth the time to see the Crown Jewels. We viewed the Tower from outside and took photos but hurried on to catch the boat ride. As it turned out, when we got to the boat pier, the boat ride was full and we would have to wait another hour for the next one, In hindsight, we would have been better off just resting a bit and going inside the Tower, but we didn't. An enjoyable experience, and had we been younger, I'm sure we would have been up for seeing the inside of the Tower. Based on photos posted on TripAdvisor, it appears that photos inside the Tower may be prohibited as well. The Tower has a fascinating history."
"August 14, 2023",Never fails to impress!,"The tower is always an amazing combination of history, architecture, local stories, armor and weapons, topped of with the display of the Crown Jewels. A lot of walking and steps, but well worth the effort!"
"August 14, 2023",The Heart of London History,"So much to see and do, all times of day and all times of the year. The intensity of the historical events, the pain, torture and loss of life all blend into this uniquely vibrant but tranquil unique place."
"August 14, 2023",Crown Jewels Did Not Disappoint!,I had always wanted to visit the Tower of London and was thrilled when I had an extra day to do so. My main objective was to see the Crown Jewels and I was not disappointed!  What a fabulous venue to be immersed in history.
"August 14, 2023","Get there early, see the Crown Jewels first","We visited on Sunday arriving 9.20 with a pre booked entry for 9.30 and were allowed straight in Top tip is to go straight to the Crown Jewels, we went straight in (no queues at any point) and saw everything at leisure. Fantastic experience Then back to the entrance to join a beefeater tour. We were very lucky to have Yeoman Warder Watts as our guide. Informative, amusing and a very entertaining hour well spent. Thank you so much We had lunch in the New Armouries cafe. Very expensive, but absolutely delicious sandwich, sausage roll and salads. Next visit we will take a picnic thoughIt took us until 3pm to see everything without rushing, much longer than we had planned. Fantastic place, great history and we felt privileged to have been able to have been so close to the crown etc from King Charles coronation. We will return 😊"
"August 13, 2023",Fun and Educational,"The Tower of London is an incredibly important historical place. The stories that originate from here are truly amazing. The tour we did included the ""Beefeater"" guide and wow, what fun our ""Beefeater"" guide was! I suggest you budget at least 4 hours here to fully enjoy all the site has to offer."
"August 13, 2023",It was all right,It was all right. Lots of waiting in lines. The Crown Jewels were nice. I think that I might have been better to pay for a guided tour. De digital guide was not worth the money.
"August 13, 2023",worth a visit,we visited here on a coach trip so we had a set time to go around we where advised to go to the crown jewels 1st as this was the main place to visit it was amazing to see all the different jewels etc that the tower keeps safe you could book on tour with a beefeater but we just went around we also visited several towers and the chapel also we saw where people where executed and where queen anne was executed on the lawn near the chapel is a cushion and a monument to here there is lots of armour suits and swords and guns we just did not have enough time to look around everywhere would recommend a visit
"August 13, 2023",Great Stop in London,The tower of London is a must see in London.   A great tour for both adults and kids as you get to walk around the tower on your own as well as get a tour.   
"August 12, 2023",Brilliant!!!!!!,"Omg absolutely amazing trip, if you visit London this is a must, if you get ‘Nev’ as you’re guide you’re incredibly lucky, he had us in stitches all the way around and was so knowledgable, learnt so much that day, even the young children were enthralled."
"October 25, 2023",Nice for a quick visit.,"Went here on a whim on our visit to London, tickets were easy and quick to book online, with information about ticket types. Grounds were well kept and maintained. You could walk around the main outside of the building in one big circle, so that helped not being lost on where you were going and missing parts - quite obviously, there are small, winding stair cases at points, just something to be aware of. There were some Halloween aspects set up around the grounds, these were fab, and it's something I wish there was more of as the displays were nice. We didn't elect for the crown jewels tour, a) as the queue was too long which is to be expected, and b) we just weren't interested. Walking around the grounds took us about 2 hours, and with other things to do nearby this is great to pop in and do something for a short while.Wait staff in the café could have been a little friendlier - the lady that did serve us went to do something, came back and I didn't even know we were being seen to until she asked us if that was everything we wanted."
"October 18, 2023",It’s a UNESCO site for a reason,"I would put this on your definitely must see list. Couple of tips you really don’t need the audio guide added some value but not that much. Definitely do the beefeater tour. The second tour of the day has half the people as the first tour of the day they start at 10 and run every 30 minutes so it’s easy to take number two.We were told to go to the crown jewels first thing actually on a Wednesday in October. That’s the only time of the day there was a line so it doesn’t look very crowded. When you enter the park I might give it a few minutes to clear out also. Easy to take the underground right to the facility again, this is what I would call a definite do"
"January 24, 2023",Superbloom or not!,"Our expectations were not high when visiting Superbloom at the Tower of London.  We had seen the gardens from a distance and read the reports in the press so was not expecting much.We visited towards the end of Superbloom when there was no entrance charge. We had to use the stairs to enter the site (there is also a step free entrance) as the slide was closed (we did visit during the period of mourning for Queen Elizabeth 2 where, being a Royal Palace, fun activities were probably suspended).Well, what can I say other than we enjoyed our visit.  The gardens looked a lot better close up and whilst a lot of the flowers had died back there was still some left.  The piped background music gave some atmosphere and there was still plenty of staff around to answers questions.  Many benches throughout the garden provided ample opportunities to sit, relax and to enjoying the early autumn sunshine and the views.Even when in full bloom I think the entrance fee was probably a bit high and the souvenirs were very expensive  (at full price) but being end of season everything was on offer and we got some bargains.Being Historic Royal Palaces members we also visited the tower briefly – it is so good just to be able to pop in for a short while; see a part of the castle we have not visited for a while; have some refreshments then to use the facilities before heading off to see one of the many other attractions in the areas (e.g. Leadenhall Market, St Katherine Docks, Butlers Whalf, St Dunstan in the East Church Gardens."
"July 6, 2022",Fabulous Superbloom,"Absolutely wonderful experience walking through the moat to see all the wild flowers.  We even went on the long bumpy slides (and we are great-grandparents) - very scary but great fun. Thoroughly recommend it.  The visits are timed so, although busy, you did not feel too crowded or rushed in any way."
"June 1, 2022",Great day at the Tower,We had a brilliant day at the Tower. Thanks to the advice given on this site we chose to go and see the Crown Jewels first (at around 10.30) and were able to walk straight in... later in the day the queue was pretty huge! Would definitely recommend the free Yeoman Warder talk - very entertaining and informative for all the family. I was only expecting us to stay until early afternoon but we were still there at around 5pm - there really is lots to see and do so allow lots of time for your visit.
"October 9, 2021",Terrific Tower,Spent 6 hours here and could have done at least another 2. What an amazing place and they must have opened up more of the battlements and turrents since I last visited years ago. The Crown Jewels are still awesome and we were so lucky not to have to queue although i think the pre booking has improved the visit experience as it was far better without crowds of people and shuffling around. The Beefeater tour was entertaining and a must as they really do give you an insight into its history.  Loved the interactive part of the White Tower where we tried our hand at dressing the king and shooting a cannon. Views across the Thames were of course amazing. It was certainly well worth the admission price. It gives Goosebumps to think you are treading in the same place  as past king and queens - and very poignant moments in the chapel thinking of those executed. A must for everyone.
"May 24, 2021","See the Crown Jewels, the ravens","See the Crown Jewels, the ravens, Bloody Tower, Medieval Palace, battlements, the public outside areas of the Tower of London and magnificent armour displays in the White Tower, including Line of Kings. All other buildings remain closed. Meet our Yeoman Warders positioned along the one-way route and hear their captivating stories about the history of the Tower."
"October 26, 2023",Very cool history!,"This was one of my favorite visits on my trip! Coming from the US it's amazing to stand in buildings that were built more than a thousand years ago. We arrived in time for the beefeater tour. It was very crowded so sometimes it was hard to hear the guide, but he was very informative and funny. One of the ravens walked right up to me too! The queue for the Crown Jewels was quite long but once you get inside there is plenty of room to wander. They have other artifacts on display before you get to the main event, and you can take your time and ride the moving sidewalk as many times as you like. We also visited the chapel where Anne Boleyn is buried.My group left earlier than I would have liked, but it is a lot of walking on uneven paths. I recommend to arrive early and try to see as much as you can!"
"April 29, 2022",The Crown Jewels,"Had a great day at the Tower of London, what a rich history. The Yeoman’s were very knowledgeable and very friendly. Highlight for me was seeing the Crown Jewels up close, wow they are incredibleWould highly recommend but allow plenty of time for your visit"
"December 23, 2021",Superb,If there was one good thing about this dreadful Covid situation it's that London is so quiet at the moment so my family and I took the opportunity to finally visit  the Tower Of London. During our visit it was very quiet which meant we had a better chance to see all the wonderful things they have and loved walking around the battlements. All the staff we met and spoke to were wonderful and gave us great tips on less obvious things to look out for. Thank you for a memorable experience!
"August 10, 2023",Crown Jewels,I loved the guard who talked about the history of the tower because of how funny he was. The Crown Jewels were amazing to see.
"August 10, 2023",too many people,"Went yesterday with 13 and 9 year old.   It's a lovely place and we had no problem getting in.  We were looking forward to the beefeater tour, but there were so many people we couldn't hear a word he was saying :-(  Everything had a really long queue, so we didn't get to see the crown jewels as the waiting in the sun would have been too much.   Long queues for virtually everything else, except the toilets which were great.    I think in hindsight it would be much better to go out of high season and get there early before the queues build for all the popular things to see.  So the place is good, but think about your timing.   "
"August 10, 2023",This is a must,What an awesome day out. Quite spectacular indeed. Highlight was the white tower. Yeoman tour guide was marvelous.
"August 9, 2023",Fantastic experience…,We booked online as soon as we knew that the crowns (including the St Edwards & Imperial State) & the regalia used for the coronation of King Charles & Queen Camilla were back at the Tower. A truly fascinating history of the Tower Of London that’s really well detailed on the Beefeater tour….don’t miss out! The Crown Jewels are spectacular to see….we had about a 2hr queue once you accessed the Tower grounds. No photos. Once inside we spoke at length to a really helpful member of staff who was extremely informative.
"August 9, 2023",A beautiful visit,i had a very good da visiting this place. It was very beautiful place and wass not much crowded when i visited this place.
"August 9, 2023",Great Experience,The experience was wonderful. Highly recommend.There are quite a few narrow doorways and steps to navigate.
"August 9, 2023",Great trip and well worth the money.,Ava was such a joy to listen and talk too. She was very knowledgeable. The bud driver was very safe and we had a smooth ride m
"August 9, 2023",Tower of London Tour,Great tour that you can make as long or as short as you wish. Go early (we went at 9am) and do Crown Jewels first as the long grows pretty quickly as the morning goes on. Beefeatee Mark was fabulous - you get some entertainment along with some history.
"August 9, 2023",Tremendous Tower of London,Simply brilliant - we spent 5 hours covering everything on offer. The tour has been put together so well and it works for young and old. So much information and an education.
"August 9, 2023",Truly rewarding experience,Good queue managing at entrance. Helpful and friendly staff. Clean toilets. Refreshments available. We spent three hours there.
"November 15, 2021",Go see the changing of the guards!,"Definitely on the top 10 list of places to go in London. The changing of the guards is a must-see too. Funny how they say “who comes there” instead of “who goes there”…makes total sense, as they explained….we don’t care who is going, we want to know who is coming."
"February 3, 2020",The Dark Side of London's History,"Very informative. The Yeomen Warder (beefeater) guide was funny as hell! Dry British Humor at its best! Every brick and stone has a history worth hearing. Don't spend your time taking selfies, try to take in all what the beefeater is saying, it really is really interesting. Once the tour is done, then you can go about with the selfies, for instagram's sake. Great tour. Great Guide. All-around worth every cent (or pence)."
"August 21, 2023",Worth visiting,"Great experience, the collection of the crown jewels was magnificent and worth the wait in the long line.There is a cafe where you can order different types of food.I've spent a few hours at the place, but you can easily spend the whole day there if you go to all the exhibitions."
"January 2, 2020",Great place to bring history alive,"I went in half term in October with my 6 and 12 Yr old. My 12 Yr old was learning about William the conquer, so visiting the tower really helped bring the subject alive for him. As a family we love history, so the Wardens tour again helped bring the subject alive, especially when he used my 12 Yr old to demonstrate beheading, which both my kids thought was brilliant. Visiting the church and seeing the names of those killed at the tower was particularly thought provoking for us all. Didn't have to wait too long for the crown jewels, no longer than 30 mins. It's one of London must see buildings."
"June 2, 2022",Challenging,"We visited the tower on 30th May 2022. We were quite disappointed as the place is not very wheelchair friendly. There are to many cobbles and you can’t visit many things in there because they are all accessible by stairs. Whilst we got the carer ticket free which is good, it is still expensive if the only things you can see are outside."
"January 17, 2023",So Much History,We took this tour using our London Pass.  The tour guides are very unique...ex military with distinguished service records.  The guided tours give you a very good 45 minute high level history tour.  You can then self tour the grounds/building including seeing the Crowned Jewels.  Overall a very good tour.
"March 13, 2022",Well worth the admission,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and found the staff very helpful.The portholes for taking photos were really helpful and the views on a clear day were excellent. The glass floor was fascinating, if slightly unnerving but the younger generation seemed to be thrilled by the ceiling mirrors."
"August 13, 2022",All pomp & crown Jewels.,We pre - booked  for 10.30 ..but got in for 10.00 so a bonus for us as it meant we could go and beat the queues for the Crown Jewels.. was it worth it !!??? It was ok !? As for the rest of the tower again its not overwhelming but with the odd changing of the Guard and the obligatory Beefeaters walking around not much to get to excited about or you may  fancy a drink or a bite to eat in the overpriced cafe ....still its a must do when in London-and still worth a visit
"May 3, 2022",Tower of London.. Scott Kelly Beefeater ,"Absolutely amazing experience here today. Would highly recommend it, I came a few years ago but wanted to come back to listen to the Beefeaters tour. We had the Beefeater Scott Kelly who was fantastic. In fact can I just say how fabulous they all, are so informative and happy to chat with everyone."
"April 4, 2023",Great Experience,"Great place. Definitely reccomend a tour by Beefy409 he was amazing, really put his all into the tour and eveyone loved it.Lots to see and do, it was busy but everywhere is in London so not sure why people moan about this. Great place to visit."
"April 14, 2023",A must! ,This review could go on and on. Definitely for us it was worth it. The history and the scenery and everything else was fantastic. We did a self-guided tour and spent about 3 hours there and could have spent more time but ran short.
"January 6, 2020",Definite Visit if in UK,"Plan for an entire day if it during a peak day, i.e. weekend or holiday time frame. Plan for long lines for each section that can last up to 1.5 hours inside. We went end of December and were able to get into only 2 sections."
"November 21, 2023",Beefy 409,Beefy 409 made our trip. I would thoroughly recommend attending a tour with a Beefeater (Yeoman of the Guard). He brought entertainment & many Stories of the history of the tower to life with his enthusiasm & passion.
"August 17, 2023",You gotta love lines,"Word of advice if you don't want to wait around all day GO FIRST THING IN THE MORNING!!!Our tickets were for early afternoon and by then the place is packed with people everywhere. The line for the crown jewels exceeded the designated area and went down the hill with an estimated wait time of 45 mins to an hour, according to the sign. It's a cool building but my favorite place was the moat. It had about a dozen people wandering around and was full of wild flowers."
"January 25, 2020",Tower of Terror,"This historic landmark was amazing. I recommend going first thing in the morning when they open and head straight to the Crown Jewels. No photos are allowed. We were able to get up close though and spend time admiring them. By the time we left the tower later that day, the crowds were crowds and I’m sure tough to see the jewels. Ask lots of questions. The staff is very informative. Great views of London Bridge from the Tower. Don’t forget to visit the birds. "
"February 26, 2022",Great day at the Tower of London.,"Brilliant, there are so many interesting areas to explore. Every area we visited had amazing informative dusplays.Buildings are amazing. I can't believe how old these buildings are. Lots of walking to be done with plenty of steps and walkways. If you have mobility difficulties, some areas will be hard to access. I think we arrived at the right time, as the day went on, many of the areas were packed with tourists, which is to be expected.The crown jewels are amazing you are not allowed to take pictures. The whole area is kept spotlessly clean, with plenty of seating areas to rest your feet.Loved the Yeoman Wardens, who I stopped to have a quick chat with. Very enjoyable and knowledgeable day. I'm looking forward to our next visit."
"September 18, 2021",Loved it!,"Came in the mid-week with my girlfriend. It wasn’t too busy which made it even better, plenty of time and space to see everything without feeling too cramped or hurried. A wonderful (£5 extra) audio guide really helped to enhance the experience and I learnt so much! We also learnt a lot from a Yeoman who was positioned near the Chapel of St Peter Ad Vincula - funny, friendly and very informative. So much amazing stuff to see from the etchings in the walls by prisoners, Henry VIII’s armour and of course the State Crown Jewels which were absolutely amazing. Well worth a trip, would definitely recommend looking at going when it’s not as busy!"
"March 14, 2022",Fantastic Tower,"Despite numerous trips to London, I had never been to the Tower of Lindon, so decided to rectify that!Online booking was very straightforward, but I didn't realise you need to go to the ticket office to get a carer's ticket (my daughter has a disability) and as such, the person at the entente was a bit grumpy with me.However once inside we had a fantastic day! We elected not to do a 'Beefeater' tour due to my daughter but took our time to walk around and take everything in. We were lucky enough to have a chat with Chris the Ravenmaster and also Emma, one of the lady Yeoman Warders.Absolute must see are the Crown Jewels. We were lucky at that it was relatively quiet on our visit, so we didn't have to queue and went through twice! You really won't believe they are all genuine.Lots more to see, such as the White Tower, exhibitions, the Chapel, the 'prison room' with it's fascinating graffiti and of course, the Ravens.Food - we got hotdogs at the Raven cafe not cheap,but expected Gift shops available.As I mentioned it was quiet on our visit and I'm glad about that.  All in all, we had a fabulous day and would definitely recommend."
"November 9, 2022",Must see,"Wonderful history in an overwhelmingly grand place. All staff were wonderful and a highlight was meeting one of the Tower ravens up close while it was casually perched on a bench! If you like old buildings, gory history, the Monarchy, Ravens, any history at all, architecture, pompous displays of wealth, great views of the Thames, or implements of torture, this is a must visit. Note on accessibility: staff are helpful and accommodating. Most of the towers and buildings are via stairs but they do have lifts in some areas. Lots of walking but also a fair bit of seating."
"October 29, 2022",Good but needs deeper William the Conqueror background.,"Great experience, but the history of William the Conqueror is only very lightly delved into, and it deserves more.  Before my second visit, I actually visited Bayeux, France whose tapestry museum explains him in much more detail.  With this information in hand, my second visit to the Tower was so much more complete.  Suggest you read about William before you go to appreciate the historical significance appropriately."
"October 13, 2023",Great morning at The Tower of London,"Enjoyed our morning at The Tower of London. We were in at 10am and went straight to see the Crown Jewels display,  as heard later there would be a queue. Was good advice.Then did the free Beefeater tour - our guide was Shady , an interesting , humorous and informative 40 minute walk and talk on the history of the Tower. Then explored on our own. Would definitely recommend."
"October 21, 2023",A long time overdue visit,"Wifey, myself & friend visited here on the first day of half term and glad we booked our tickets online because, when we arrived, there was a 5 hour wait if you hadn’t !We took the Beefeater guide and, because of the really bad weather, storm Babette, we were taken into the chapel for a brief 25 minute chat which was really funny but enlightening and entertaining talk. We then left to explore the rest of the castle which the Crown Jewels exhibition, which I hadn’t seen since i was 8 0r 9, reduced me to tears in heir scope & beauty…The Ghosts walking around in celebration of Halloween were a great addition…My only criticism would be the 30 minute talk we decided to listen to in the chapel in the white tower which was very very dry…Overall, despite he weather we had a great day !!!"
"September 3, 2021",Excellent for sunflower families. Staff go above and beyond! ,"I have just returned from a day out at the tower and have never felt so compelled to write a review! I was with my two children, the youngest of whom has special needs, and my mum (who had an injured foot) I had chosen to come post covid as I knew it was slightly less busy and my son would cope better - however I really needn't have worried, as soon as we entered I got chatting to a Yeoman Warder, he showed me his sunflower wristband and told me about his family members similar to my son, made such a fuss of both of my kids and I felt so welcome straight away! This theme continued with all the staff, my con often touched people's legs, and got the rear end of another warder, I was mortified as usual, but he and another warder laughed it off and made us all laugh too, again making a fuss of both of my kids, as my elder child can often get a bit left out when her brother takes priority, this wasn't the case at the tower! When in the main, white tower the staff again went above and beyond, due to the steps we were all on foot and my son was tired, and lying on the floor, obviously although I try not to react to onlookers it makes you feel stressed, but the staff were able to approach us in such a relaxed manner, I didn't feel stressed or like we were a problem, only supported! One staff member magically got through to my son who has very limited communication and convinced him to walk to the dragon, once on that floor another staff member found his way to us and took both of my kids under his wing, showing them all the interactive games and helping them work them all in a fashion where they could both be involved! We were then offered the staff exit stairs so that it would be quieter, however we wanted to see the dungeon, so this guy held the crowd for a minute so that we could go down an otherwise very busy staircase a little more calmly! Throughout the day Yeoman Warders we had spoken to came over to chat and check we were okay, always including the kids, they also advised the best places for my mum to join in or sit out as she had injured her foot. I became a little overwhelmed with emotion near the end of the day when chatting to one warder because I have never quite experienced a whole venue that is so inclusive of autism and special needs, I would reccomend this venue to any and all families, I really felt like we might miss out not being able to have a guided tour (as my son wouldn't tolerate that) but I feel that we, and all visitors really, totally got the star treatment! I can't wait to come back, possibly on a girl's evening with my daughter and mum again to see the ceremony of the keys. We all had the BEST day! "
"October 15, 2023",Good visit,We really enjoyed our trip round the Tower of London. Lots of things to look at and the kids loved it. Need to sort the pricing out to make it affordable for the average family so more people can experience this great facility
"October 26, 2020",Safe but disappointing during covid,"After an enjoyable  visit prior to covid restrictions when we had an excellent guided tour by one of the Yeoman guards, I wanted my granddaughters to have the same experience.  This was not to be as the tours have been suspended due to Covid safety restrictions. I abandoned  the audio guide as although the facts were given, it was dry and boring for teenagers.  There are Beefeaters dotted around the Towers who will answer any questions, but if you don't know the questions to ask.......My recommendation would be to delay a visit until normal service is restored in order to have a 5* experience "
"February 3, 2020",Fantastic Day of being a tourist,"Americans, living in London, loving ""tourist days.""  This is a must.  Yeoman Warder tour is the best part of the day, retired UK military guys, devoted to maintaining traditions and sharing with others.  As a retired military myself, was proud of their professionalism and thoroughly loved their stories.  My wife and I love to read all the bits around the castle.  If you do too, plan 3-4 hours, nice cafe if you need a break."
"July 8, 2021",Just brilliant,"It's been a long time since my last visit to the Tower and it felt immensely special to be there when there were so few other tourists about, time to linger in the rooms and read all the information without being jostled or feeling like you were in the way. But any time its a fantastic place to visit and certainly a half-day or more activity - we were there from 1pm til closing and didn't see everything.A special thank you to the guide in the armoury who told even us history nerds thins we didn't know about jousting, destriers and the connection between Henry VIII and the moon landing."
"June 29, 2023",Very interesting but way too crowded,"Amazing place but I had to deduct 2 whole stars as the crowds had a big impact on my day. You are herded like cattle through all of the attractions and it’s really too busy to enjoy properly. The queue for the Crown Jewels was over an hour long (I went Monday morning) and you had to queue for the majority of other things for a while. At over £30pp they must be making a fortune! Would be good to see limits on amount guests per day. Otherwise staff were very nice, attractions were interesting and place looked great. Wild garden at the most was especially lovely (and nice and quiet!). I’d love to go back without the thousands of people there"
"February 24, 2020",Too much to see,"We arrived around 11 and bought our entry through the bus tour so got 20% off. The place is steeped in history and make sure you go on one of the tours, they are free, very interesting and highly amusing. My only piece if advise I would give is arrive early and expect to spend most of the day here. We were there for a good 5-6 hours and we didn't see everything. (Good excuse to go back!!!) I can also imagine if you went in peak times the queue for the crown jewels would be unbearable!! Definitely worth a visit."
"April 9, 2023",A walk through history with one of the Beefeaters!,We did ours via a London Pass in 1st week of April. The narrated tour with one of the beefeaters was great and very informative. The stories they tell and the history was very fascinating. Highly recommended!! We didn't get to see the jewels etc since the lines were too long and we were slightly pressed for time that day.
"August 3, 2022",See the crown jewels!,Wee opted not to take a tour and just go on our own.  It was broiling hot outside but the interiors of the tower are reasonably cool.  You are provide with a map upon arrival and it is very easy to negotiate your way around depending on where your interests lie.  The crown jewels are a definite must-see but so many of the aspects of this amazing property are fascinating.  Enjoyed it very much.
"July 22, 2021",Yeoman Warder Tour with Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly hashtag Beefy409 ,"When in London come on down to the Tower of London. Come and explore the vast wealth of history that is buried within the inner and outer walls. A must do is a Yeoman Warder tour. I would highly recommend having a tour with none other that Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly hashtag Beefy409. If you want blood, sweat, shock horror and gore and I mean gore then he is your Yeoman to give you it all. Well worth it and then you can explore the rest of this Royal Hostorical Palace in your own leisure. You will get a glimpse of the Crown Jewels, see the Ravens and the guards. There is something for all ages. You can even have a photo with your favourite Yeoman Warder.."
"August 17, 2023",Suprisingly Good,We were slightly late that morning but we didn't miss out on the tour. We joined a Beefeater tour! The best tour we had on our trip. He gave all the gruesome details but balanced that with a great sense of humor. I overheard an American tourist tell her child that British people have a very different sense of humor based upon word play. I love that sense of humor - it is a very intelligent sense of humor. We also spent time in the cafe - the food was fantastic and all the food was labelled for allergens. My son also went and spent time with the ravens and was very impressed with that exhibit as well.
"July 21, 2023",Go somewhere else!,"10'oc in the morning and the place was well on its way to being jammed packed. Twice took audio back as it wasn't working , 3rd time gave up and just went with the flo of reading what was available on walls. Most rooms had nothing in them apart from written history on walls.. crown jewels was a nightmare with no control of crowds and pushing and shoving. Queued for about 25 mins...Can't tell you how many times I got attacked by a pushchair!. Got round the whole place in about 2 hrs and every beefeater we spoke to was so polite. Thank god for them ! but absolutely would not go back, total waste of money spoilt by no crowd control."
"November 12, 2021",Beautiful day overall but I do hold a grudge,"Absolutely beautiful place to visit with so much interesting information and history to learn, beefeaters  all very helpful and we really enjoyed our time there. Great value for money and the children loved every part of it, my only issue was with a rather large round person who seem to be called spike ( sure that’s not what his mother named him ) anyway very very rude and patronising who seemed to have a rather high opinion of himself and was rude and offensive to quite a number of people in the crowd that day. He really let himself down and the team around him because of his behaviour ! I’m thinking he is someone who thought he was way more important than he actually was.Because of how he made people feel I would not return  but other than that easy to get to and a lovely day out."
"April 3, 2022",Tour with friends,I visited here on Friday 1st April 2022 we had a very informative and humorous tour with Gary. Highly recommend for a good day out in London. We also got a good deal on days out 2for1 tickets
"November 3, 2022",Tower of London,We spent several hours at the tower of london. So much history and the people there to assist you were great. The way it is set up it is easy to get around. We recommend the audio tour which was very interesting and told us about things in depth which was really nice. If you go plan on 3 hours to just see everything that is available to see. 
"July 14, 2020",Amazing ,"Very much enjoyed our trip to the Tower of London-our tour guide was very funny and had a lot of information to give us-he answered all our questions very well. Even though it was raining, it was a very enjoyable visit and lovely views over to the London Bridge. Great gift shop with a good range of stuff and a nice café to. Enjoyed the horse museum upstairs and also the walk around the walls."
"April 19, 2022","Family trip to the Tower of London, in the Easter Holidays.","A Family trip ( 2 adults 2 children) on a Wednesday morning, during the Easter Holidays.Prepaid and booked a family ticket, which was easy to collect no queue.Straight in through the front gates staff were friendly and welcoming, again no queue. Once inside we shot straight into see the Crown Jewels, glad we did because a little later the line to get in was enormous.Spent just over 3 hours there and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. You could easily spend a day in there but I would say 3-4 hours will cover the main attractions and general experience."
"November 23, 2023",Tower of London tour.,"Started promptly at 11:30, quite a small group of about 35, and led around by Yeoman warden 420 GaryMcCormick was both fascinating and informative. I don’t know if they have to pass exams to do this job but his knowledge is immense. Humour also arrived but unfortunately some people don’t have experience of army humour. All in all a fantastic experience led by a devoted guy to the job. Ps no I don’t work there!"
"July 22, 2023",Well worth the money,"What an absolutely fantastic day. Totally surprised on our arrival to be met by an original beefeater who took us on a guided tour for 1 hour, he was amazing, funny and very very knowledgable. Beautiful place well looked after. Advise to wear comfy shoes. Down side if you have limited mobility this will not be for you."
"July 22, 2023",Fascinating history," Our party of 2 adults and 2 teenagers spent 5.5 hrs here exploring all buildings. The Yeoman’s talks were amusing and informative inspiring us to research English history in more detail. Id like to say the highlight  was the crown jewels but  I think for me, it is the history- Henry VIII, Richard III, Lady Jane Grey and the royal beasts."
"July 22, 2023",Excellent,Beefy 409 was the best !! Made the entire experience ! Honestly thank you so much to him a true hero and a great story teller 
"July 21, 2023",Go somewhere else!,"10'oc in the morning and the place was well on its way to being jammed packed.

Thank god for them ! but absolutely would not go back, total waste of money spoilt by no crowd control."
"July 20, 2023",Interesting,"We looked on trip advisor and some people said allow 2-3 hours to visit. I would say you need all day, we were there 5 hours and could have stayed longer. When we arrived we did the yeoman/beefeater tour, the guy who did this was so funny and knowledgeable, made the tour fun.  We then queued for the crown jewels, it did say 45 mins from where we started, but it wasn't that long. There are so many thing to see and do, it really was worth visiting"
"July 20, 2023",Overpriced,"Over priced for what you get. Plus, they don't make it very clear if key pieces of the collection of crown jewels are not on display so it's hard to make an informed decision before buying tickets.All the staff members we interacted with on the day were lovely to speak to."
"July 20, 2023",Great views and architectfacts,"Would have been awesome experience, but it started raining during the middle of exhibit.  Still inenjoyed the Crown Jewels"
"July 19, 2023",Great day out.,Great experience made all the better for the humorous tour with the Yeoman Warder. We arrived early and did the Crown Jewels and White tower before the masses arrived. After that we could leisurely wander around the walls and other bits without queuing. Take a packed lunch if the weather is good.Plan on about 4 hours with small ones.
"July 19, 2023",Good to sightsee but guide needs better volume,The tour was ok and the Crown Jewels were lovely.  I would like to suggest that the Beefeater tour guide could use a device so we can hear better.
"July 17, 2023",Very Enjoyable ,We had a very enthusiastic Beefeater…he was very entertaining and informative and made for a very enjoyable visit to Tower of London.
"July 8, 2023",Amazing Experience!,A must visit stop when in London! Really great tour of one of the oldest structures in London. And the guide for my tour was fabulous! He was funny and very informative. He also gave great advice for which places of the Tower of London are a must see!
"July 8, 2023",Wish we'd had more time!,"Despite several trips to London as an adult, I've never visited the Tower and this was my first trip with my 9 year son so did the National Rail 2 for 1 deal which was a great saving. We initially just wandered but then I thought it wise to join a Yeoman Warder tour and so glad we did. Nev was our guide and he was brilliant. Informative, engaging and suitably dramatic when required! I was in stitches. Saw the Crown Jewels - the queue looked long but moved quickly. We had a good wander after the guided tour, saw the ravens, some of the White Tower (too many stairs for the limited time we had). Could've easily spent a lot more time there! Fascinating place and well worth a visit."
"July 8, 2023",Excellent ,"Beefeater Scott Kelly is the best person ever !!!!!  Beefy409 ! Made our visit so special!! Fountain of knowledge, really made everyone laugh  and a true hero. "
"July 7, 2023",Beefeater’s!!,Do the beefeater tour. Great information!  Great energy!  Experienced professionals who love what they do. Thanks SMG!!  The rest can be done on your own and is very good. You will need at least two hours.
"July 7, 2023",NEV rocks!,"Amazing tour with NEV! The best Yeomen Warder of them all gave the tour. Funny, friendly, knowledgeable and professional. Nev is the rock star of the “Beefeaters”. Excellent tour. Educational and fun."
"July 7, 2023",10 out of 10,All exhibitions well organized and easy to access. Overall an amazing historic attraction. A highlight was NEV who gave us a free tour. He is informative and speaks with great affection and  humor. Throughly enjoyed his tour!
"July 6, 2023",Tower of London and a real live Beefeater!,"Visiting the Tower of London, was one of the highlights, of my London vacation.  Our tour guide was a gregarious Beefeater!"
"July 6, 2023","Overcrowded by midday, would need 4+ hours to see all exhibits at peak times.","Too crowded by far.  Due to minor illness in our party we weren’t able to attend until 1230 and needed to leave at 230 for another commitment.  We would have wasted most of the time queuing for the Crown Jewels if we had committed to it (theTower advises it takes 9minutes to complete the exhibit).  I’m sure it is worth a reasonable wait if you have the time.  However I was not expecting the lengthy queues for most of the other exhibits.  We managed to do the white tower, the battlements and the section on imprisonment and execution only in 2 hours.  Queuing 20 minutes for prepaid audio guide (same queue as those paying on the spot) was also disappointing and the commentary itself was underwhelming (compared to the Roman Baths and Stonehenge audio guide tours, as examples of quality).  Go early if you plan to go at all, unless you have the whole day free and enjoy queuing!"
"July 6, 2023",Go early!,"The Tower of London is a great visit. We especially loved the Crown Jewels. If you’re going to visit here, do it as early in the morning as possible. The Tower grounds get CRAZY packed by mid morning.  Otherwise, it’s a really interesting way to spend a good 2 1/2 hours. Definitely worth a visit!"
"July 5, 2023",Busy school holiday - but fascinating,"My mother and I were there during May half-term,  (which we didn't realize, being from Canada) so it was very busy. The Yeoman Warder was an excellent and funny tour guide, and the stories in the outdoor areas were fascinating! Mom had some trouble exiting Sir Walter Raleigh's study - some of the staircases are uneven, twisting and narrow for those with balance or mobility challenges. The White Tower was chock full of history for those that love it - which I do. We didn't get the chance to see the crown jewels, as the line was insanely long. I can't imagine less than a 1.5 hour wait, given the school holiday - there's no way we could have stood that long, so that was quite  a disappointment. Overall, a beautiful UNESCO heritage site, well presented, with lots of history. Just go with a good understanding of how busy it's likely to be, and your own mobility needs."
"July 17, 2023",Crown jewels,thanking all the others who pointed out you need to beeline to the crown jewels.  Getting there after 10 am is courting fate.  
"July 16, 2023",A Must See!,"A must see for anyone in London.  I recommend adding the guidebook to your purchase, we found this to be very informative.  We also recommend going on the included tour that meets at the front of the Tower.  The tour guide was very informative and entertaining.  We did not use the audio guide, and the line was very long to get them.  If English is your primary language, I don't see the need for the audio guide.  The line for the crown jewels seemed very long, but it moved very quickly, and was well worth the wait."
"July 16, 2023",Too crowded to see much of anything,"First of all, we booked online because they said they had limited entry. If so, their limit must be an incredibly large number. We were there on a weekday morning. There were so many people that it was absolute chaos almost everywhere we went. We tried to join a free Beefeater tour, but the tour was so crowded that we couldn't hear anything the guide was saying. So we took our map and wandered off. The line for the crown jewels was about 2 hours long, so we scratched that off our list. Ended up just going to a few museums, (including the Fusilier Museum and the Imprisonment in the Tower exhibit, which were very interesting), walking along the tops of the walls, and eating a sandwich outside on a bench because the restaurant was so crowded there were no tables available. I was there back in 1982 and the tours were limited to about 10-15 people. I remember seeing the crown jewels without standing in line for 2 hours. I think they need to really put a limit on how many people can come in at once. I'd say, if you like to fight crowds and stand in long lines, then this is the place to go. Unfortunately, I feel like it was a waste of money for what we got out of it."
"July 16, 2023",Great glimpse of Royal British treasure,Amazing jewelry and world famous koh-I-nur diamond that  was taken from India. Other great diamond one if the largest in the world taken from Africa was also in the royal treasure
"July 16, 2023",Tremendous Tower.,"Wonderful visit, and the highlight was the Beefeater tour led by Darren Hardy, who kept all the crowd highly entertained with the history of the Tower and the terrible tortures and execution that took place. As we toured around the grounds, we were also enthralled by the other Beefeaters doing the tours. There is so much history to enjoy, and many thanks to all the staff and volunteers for such a great day out."
"July 16, 2023",Make sure you have a QR code. TripAdvisor is not help,QR code would not work. They did not let us in. I bought different tickets. Be careful. TripAdvisor needs to do better or else will lose customers
"July 15, 2023",Brilliant place to visit,"We had the most amazing tour guide Nev. His sense of humour was perfectly British and you can see he loves his job. My Husband and I visited the Tower of London on our wedding anniversary. We were very lucky with the weather as they predicted rain but it was clear all the time we were at the Tower of London. Although the queue looked long to see the crown jewels, it moved very quickly. I went on the travelator 3 times to get a good look at the jewels. I was more impressed by the jewels and intricate details of the  Sceptre ! Would definitely recommend a visit. Brilliant tour and place to visit. God save King!!!!!!"
"July 15, 2023",Very interesting but huge crowds,Very informative and entertaining guide. Site is very interesting. Crowd was huge. Would be better if they limited the size of the group
"July 15, 2023",Don’t Waste Your Money,"If you go in the afternoon you’ll not get the tour, and if you realize the London Pass is a better choice for you after you purchase this, they don’t give you a refund. So money straight to the bin."
"July 14, 2023",Absolutely Awesome!,"We went to the Tower of London with a group of teenagers, had a great time.  We ate at the cafe, excellent food as well.  The highlight was the Ceremony of the Keys, fantastic experience one we will never forget!"
"February 25, 2022",Great time spent in an historic area.,"When we first walked into The Tower of London we were greeted by a Yeoman who explained if we waited for 5 minutes a tour was about to start. Clive was our Yeoman/Beefeater who took us around. He was incredibly insightful, and his jokes weren’t too bad hahaha. To be honest he made our trip in the Tower of London really enjoyable.I would recommend you do a tour (free)."
"May 21, 2022",London Tower and Yeoman Warder tour,The Yeoman Warder tour was great. Warder Scott Kelly gave an enthusiastic retelling of many of the historic events that have taken place at the Tower since it was first built. The tour was free and was definitely worth the 15 minutes wait at the entrance. The armor collection inside the White Tower was impressive and the Crown Jewel exhibit in the building across the courtyard is incredible.Would absolutely recommend for anyone visiting London.
"February 16, 2022",History brought to life.,Tied in with the kids’ school curriculum at the moment and helped bring the history to life. Went to see the Crown Jewels having lived abroad for six years so this was a kind of cultural thing for us. There are plentiful bathrooms and refreshments. Things to improve on: the gift shops offer truly terrible and tacky merchandise and if you visit in the summer when it is busier and have to wait outside in the switchback area then you won’t have shade from rain or shine so be prepared.  Staff were great in all cases.
"June 18, 2021",Don't leave this off your London list,This is definitely a highlight of London and must-see.  There is so much history here and presented in a great way for families of all ages.  The Yeoman are wonderful and give great information.  Definitely go to the Crown Jewels first as queues do pick up later and the White Tower had a queue after we had been in as well.  A couple of places were sadly closed but the majority was open and my family had an enjoyable time.  Toilets were clean and the shop was full of nice trinkets.
"July 22, 2023",Fascinating history," Our party of 2 adults and 2 teenagers spent 5.5 hrs here exploring all buildings. The Yeoman’s talks were amusing and informative inspiring us to research English history in more detail. Id like to say the highlight  was the crown jewels but  I think for me, it is the history- Henry VIII, Richard III, Lady Jane Grey and the royal beasts."
"April 17, 2023",Amazing day…,"After visiting London all throughout my childhood, the only attraction I haven’t done is the Tower of London. My fiancé and I decided to do this as part of my birthday weekend away and it’s safe to say it didn’t disappoint! We had a fantastic day, spent around 4 hours round there, spending time reading all of the history about the Tower of London. The highlight of our trip was seeing the Crown Jewels. We had to queue for 45 mins but was so worth it. The only downside was not being able to take any photos in that area- would have loved to have done this as a keepsake.100% worth every penny!"
"August 13, 2022",Get there before 11 & Go to the Crown Jewels 1st before the queue starts,"I’ve been so many times to London and never been here but after watching the show I knew we had to go and we’re not disappointed. So easy to get too, get around and the amount to see is fantastic. So much history all in one place. We were there 5 hours and didn’t see it all. Mainly because it was the heatwave and we were all in need of a rest and shade but saw 90% of it. Definitely be back to see the rest. Go to the Crown Jewels 1st"
"January 26, 2020",Great fortress to see from in and out,"This well maintained fortress used to be a prison where were settled well known prisoners. Building itself is huge and amazing, worth to see in the evening as is highlighted. It is located just next to Tower Bridge. Worth to admire it from Tower Bgidge upper level where you can get for aprox. £10."
"October 25, 2022",Spent day queuing,"Really disappointing visit. Appreciate it was half term but the queues were so long for everything that we spent most of the day queuing. I can live with queuing for the Crown Jewels but for every other tower, exhibition and area it was just too much. The only thing we didn’t queue for was initial entry. When we did get into the different areas it was so packed you couldn’t appreciate the exhibits. So sad as what we did see was really interesting. The Crown Jewels were stunning to see in real life."
"January 2, 2020",Amazing! English history at its best,Been here a few times and it does not fail to amaze and excite me. There is so much history in these walls and they way that it’s exhibited is brilliant. The Yeoman Warders are fantastic and there is not a piece of knowledge that they don’t know and share. They also bring a good amount of entertainment with their humour. Can’t wait to go back again!!
"February 17, 2023",Family visit,"First time at the Tower and will definitely go back.Easy to  get to.Good value.Beuatifully maintained.Incredibly historic building with an enormous amount of artefacts, especially armour.The queue for the crown jewels was one hour, although we didn't bother as only the replicas were on show."
"April 7, 2023",Remarkable,"The Tower of London is an impressive and imposing fortress with remarkable architecture. It is a unique and must-see monument that has been standing for centuries. Its history and architecture make it a must-see for any traveler. The Tower's imposing walls and imposing architecture make it a truly remarkable site. From the White Tower to the Crown Jewels, the Tower of London is a unique and impressive experience."
"April 21, 2023",Great place to visit,"Hadn't been since we were children  (now both 70). Have watched the really interesting TV series and wanted to visit. It was great, definitely do the Yeoman Guards tour - it's free and great fun and informative."
"June 12, 2023",Huge Crowds,"The overwhelming amount of visitors detracts from the experience. We went directly to the Crown Jewels before a line had been formed, and it was certainly the most impressive part. The other stations and buildings not so great. Interesting but average. You spend a lot but expect crowds."
"October 26, 2022",Highlight of our trip,We had a great time with our guide Mark who made history come alive. He was informative and entertaining as he led us around the grounds pointing out the basic outlines of the history. After the tour we went around the battlements and got such a sense what life might have been like so long ago. Truly a worthwhile experience. Then we visited the ravens and stopped for a refreshing bite at the sandwich shop. That was a surprisingly nice moment of calm featuring great food at reasonable prices (for London). So glad we went.
"January 12, 2020",Amazing Historical Site,"The original London settlement this site is quite the history lesson. Be aware, lots of small stairs and very few lifts. Also, this is a Top 5 attraction so get there when the doors open or you won’t get to see the Crown Jewels. "
"October 17, 2022",Tower of London - Pleasurable Visit,I am so glad I visited when I did. The Crown Jewels were simply splendid. Amazing place of history as gruesome as some of it were. The architecture of the buildings are absolutely amazing. The Beefeaters were so knowledgeable and had brilliant ways of talking about the history of the place. Would definitely recommend a visit with children. Great place to spend the day and have a picnic in the ground as well. Plenty of shopping to do around the area.
"June 9, 2023",Terrific Tower,The tower was unlike anything I have seen before! I could spend all day simply walking around. The tour guide was comical but also gave very interesting information as well as providing background about the touchy subjects and events that occurred there. It took us around 3 hours or so and that was without waiting in the humongous line to see the crown jewels. There is definitely stuff I didn't see and would absolutely go back and spend the full day there!
"July 27, 2022",Lots to see and take in...history!,"We got the audio guide of the Tower and found it it be a really good way to move through the site each at our own pace. The Crown Jewels were fine, but it was the stories of all that took place on the site that was the real gem. Imaginging the fortress in days of old as anyone came up the river, it would have been an intimidating site."
"July 7, 2021",Somethings have got to be done in life,I lived in London for a decade and never visited and thing visiting an iconic building like the tower should be done in life - Its massive taking up 2- 4 hours of historical interest. Lots of steps i don't think those with accessibly issues would find it easy. I learnt so much didn't know it was the coin place and practically a zoo at one time. 
"October 29, 2023",History overload,"This is one of the can't-miss items on a list of things to do in London.  For Americans who have a casual familiarity with British history, there are a lot of aha moments as you recognize various stories and names of monarchs who a not as visible as Henry VIII.Everybody wants to see the Crown jewels, so the line to get in can be over an hour.  Luckily for us, it was not high season so we only waited about  5 minutes in line.  Unfortunately, anything worth looking at had people piled up 3 deep which made getting any appreciable look at something almost impossible.  They have tried to alleviate this problem with the best and most important of the crowns by putting in a moving walkway past them.  They should do this for the entire collection.For history buffs, the buildings have as much fascination as the jewels."
"May 21, 2022",Always wanted to visit here - loved it!,"Important piece of history not to be missed.   It was not very crowded during our visit, which was great because some of the steps in the castle area are narrow and we had to move slowly - my husband has poor sight.   The staff were very helpful and helped us up a couple of short cuts at the White Tower.   I went through the crown jewels twice since there was no line.  Apparently sometimes there is a very long wait, but we were lucky and had no waiting at all.    A must see if you visit London."
"March 14, 2023",Good history lession,An afternoon trip to the tower of london was good to be exposed to some English royal history.The line to the crown jewels was really really long so we had to skip it. Probably best to visit first thing in the morning rather than after lunch
"May 21, 2023",Great historical visit,This is a great place to visit on a first London trip.  The history is amazing and everything is very well presented and maintained.  The audio guide helps give lots of information to enhance your journey through the various areas of the Tower.  Great views and helps with the understanding of what things were like in their time.  Staff was great and very helpful.  
"October 15, 2023",Worth a visit,We went around without a guided tour but the tower of London is easy to navigate. It was really informative and there was plenty to see. Most things were accessible and there was enough information at each stage to make it informative and enjoyable.
"October 25, 2020",Fantastic ,"Booked tickets on the morning of visit very easy. Due to covid it was a lot quieter then I've been before but I felt it was better that way. Had time to visit all the aspects that are normally too busy, tho a couple of the attractions weren't open as not able to adhere to social distancing didn't spoil the day. "
"March 6, 2020",WOW!,"Pre purchased tickets that were at will call, no lines when we visited.Pros:  Get the guide tour head phones as it provides lots of insights. Make sure you circle back to view from both sides of the Crown Jewels."
"June 24, 2020",Lovely Historical Place In The City ,Went with my son and early January this year and we were very impressed with the architecture and the up-keeping of the tower plus the Royal jewellery that was in exhibition at the time. It was lovely to see the grounds are well managed m by the resident workers and was unchanged from when the Tower was occupied. We enjoyed meandering through the buildings and passage way. I’ve been here twice but still love it.
"January 5, 2023",Fantastic yeoman mark tour,"My husband and I visited The Tower of London on the 29th of December . We did a tour with Mark the yeoman. He was amazing, so funny , engaging with all age groups. You will need a good few hours to spend here, we queued for an hour to see the Crown Jewels but all other areas there was no Queue . Definitely prebook before going ."
"September 8, 2020",One of the best days out,"My son has been learning about Henry VIII so we brought him here. The Beefeaters are always so friendly and eager to chat, but it was great visiting soon after it has reopened as there were no crowds. Although a couple of parts were still closed, there was still plenty to see and we didn’t feel we had missed out."
"January 4, 2020",Second time with family,"Top attraction for families with kids! When I came here the first time there were not so many queues for each ""attraction"". We all had fun, anyway! The interactive section and the crown jewels are the parts that most interested the children (and the adults!). You can spend here the entire day with a break for lunch.Do not miss it!"
"June 22, 2022",More than one tower,We went on the guided tour and learned a great deal of history by a jovial guide dressed in period costume. Many of the anecdotes gave a little black humor to some rather grisly events that occurred over the centuries. We also saw the changing of the guards. This was suitable for all ages.
"August 22, 2022",Not just prisoners and beheadings.,"I admit, my view of the Tower was exactly that-prisoners and beheadings. There's so much more to it than that. The beefeaters are happy to share their knowledge and information with you. While we were there, an enactment of some historical scene was happening. It's a great morning activity. "
"November 16, 2022",Beefeaters,Wife and I spent a lot of time here. This is the London I was looking for not all the ugly new buildings around. My opinion only. This was a Palace Fortress and a prison. Walking ramparts or diving into every room this place is a step back in time. You have guided and unguided tours we chose to explore on our own. Crown Jewels my god the money. Put this on your list. 
"September 5, 2020",Visit with our grandchildren,We came here today and I hadn’t been in about 25 years. My husband and I loved it but my grandchildren thought it was awesome. My granddaughter thought the Crown Jewels were her favourite as did my husband. My grandson like the artillery exhibition which had the armour and the horses. I loved the torture unit. This had some sinister items that were genuinely used as punishment from some time ago. This is probably one of the best days I have had in such a long time. 
"June 2, 2020",Best Part of My Trip,"I loved the history that fairly oozes from this place. Lots of things to see and experience, you really need a whole day to explore it all. Grab lunch at the Hung, Drawn and Quartered when you're done, and a quick visit to All Hallows at the Tower after will round off the perfect day."
"December 8, 2022",Worth the £ and time if you have both.,"Excellent history lessons in Central London steps away from Tower Bridge and the turbulent Thames. The Crown Jewels are housed inside. Plan the time of your visit to get a short, free, and fun guided tour by one of the Yeoman Warders. Plan way ahead to possibly get in to watch the daily closing ceremony for a minimal fee. The souvenir booklet is worth the £5 in my opinion. Prepare to spend a few hours, there is a LOT to see. Wear sturdy shoes as there are cobblestones everywhere inside and outside the walls. Food is available inside and outside. There is a water taxi/river cruise to Westminster just steps away also. Tower Hill Underground station is <5 minutes away."
"September 20, 2021",10/10 - a must see in London,Amazing! I’ve wanted to visit for ages and I wasn’t disappointed . There is so much to see and do that you really need at least 4 hours to do this beautiful palace justice. We joined Andy on the yeoman warder tour and it started our visit off perfectly. He was able to whet out appetites to learn more and really explore the site fully. Definitely on the to do list again next time we visit London!
"April 12, 2020",Bigger on the inside,"I had a TARDIS-like experience walking through the Tower of London.  This castle has a long history in London: a royal residence and palace, armoury, treasury, prison, and the home of the Crown Jewels.  Keep an eye out for the ravens, as they have a special place in the Tower, and the ghost of Anne Boleyn is said to haunt the Tower as well.  We spent an afternoon exploring everything here, and every time I turned, there was something else to explore here.  It could easily take an afternoon."
"January 18, 2020",Must do ,"I loved my visit to the Tower of London, it is a place filled with history. The Ravenmasters who acts as tour guides are AMAZING, they gladly share their knowledge and are super fun. I normally like to visit the places on my own but I loved having the Ravenmasters in our group, it sure make the place even better. "
"July 1, 2021",So much to learn,"This is such a place of historic interest,  it really needs 2-3 hours to see it properly.However as I am in a wheelchair it really was not a great visit for me, you need to bear in mind the age of the place and that it really is not a site suitable for wheelchairs, cobbled streets etc.  Trying to please my husband I went along for the ride but was left sitting outside for long periods on a rather cold and overcast June day."
"November 14, 2021",Great Attraction,"There is a lot to see at the ToL.We are very quick around most attractions and we were still there 2 hours.You must go to the Crown Jewels first thing (before 10.30) if you don’t want to queue for long. Otherwise, you’ll lose an hour before you even see anything.A great way to see old and new London."
"May 3, 2023",Majestic and grand piece of history,"With its many towers, fortified walls, and royal palace, the Tower of London is a must-see for any visitor to London. From the iconic White Tower to the Bloody Tower, there are so many stories to explore. The Crown Jewels are on display, and the Yeoman Warders provide an informative and entertaining tour. The Tower of London is also home to a variety of wildlife, including ravens, which are said to protect the Tower. Whether you're a history buff or just looking for an interesting day out, the Tower of London is sure to leave you with lasting memories."
"May 23, 2022",A super trip and visit on a rainy day,One of Londons gems. I was born within a stones throw of the tower but this was the first time I visited. I found the whole experience amazing. Also it was suitable for children. I strongly recommend one of the Beef Eater guided tours. They seem able to blend history with amusement.
"May 18, 2020",A haunted experience,"The Tower of London is full of ghosts and spooky feels.  A lot has happened there through the years and no matter how sensitive or not you are, it's impossible not to feel something.  If you want an extra spooky experience come dressed up in Renaissance clothes.  Everyone will think you're part of the place including the ghosts.  It's very interesting to walk in the steps of all the people who came to have their heads chopped off."
"September 4, 2021",Plenty to see and great views,Two of us went on a bank holiday Monday morning and although busy we somehow managed to avoid the crowds so walked straight into the crown jewels room and had plenty of time to look at the exhibits. My favourite part of the complex was the menagerie exhibition as I had no idea wild animals were kept in royal palaces and we got up close and personal to a raven. Really friendly staff.
"June 15, 2022",Superbloom at The Tower,I visited Superbloom in the Tower moat yesterday. The event is late flowering and we have been offered the opportunity to revisit when more of the flowers are in bloom. Quiet and with lots of volunteers around to provide visitors with additional information.  However copper bowls covering drain covers all dried up and requiring re- filling with water. And Slide into the moat closed due to weather conditions…. Very disappointing!! Overall quite disappointed……
"June 22, 2022",Plenty to keep you busy!,"We were quite rushed for time and only entered near closing so we only saw the Crown Jewels and had the Yeoman's Tour, both of which were very good. Yeoman Warder Tom O'Reilly was our guide and he was well versed in the history of the palace. We were impressed with his knowledge and we wish him well. :) We spent the remainder of our time there wandering the grounds and it was a lovely time. Will return for a longer stay and a good look around. We were bummed that we couldn't get there earlier in the day, but we made up for it in the gift shop!!"
"September 19, 2020","Historic gaol, fortress and Palace.","Always wanted to visit, I did the trip and did so now as without the crowds especially the large tour groups, you could take your time and we enjoyed the extra space and time.we had.The crown Jewels, The Armoury and the Architecture were all just really awesome, as were the knowledgeable Beefeaters who were very welcoming. If you get the tube to Tower Hill make sure you take in the Roman wall as you walk to the Tower. The Romans chose the spot due to its unique dominant location, as did the Towers builders.."
"October 27, 2020",Glad we visited,"I’d not been to the Tower of London for years so I’m glad we finally got around to doing this. Everything was efficient and well organised. Have to admit I was slightly underwhelmed by the Crown Jewels. Although the walkway moves slowly I didn’t feel there was time to fully take them in. Staff we met were all very engaging, informative and friendly."
"May 22, 2023",Great day out,"This is a great attraction to visit whilst in London. There is so much to see and you could easily spend the entire day there. There was a huge queue at the entrance but it moved quickly. Definitely try and get there early. The Beefeaters tours run frequently however there is no cap on numbers so there could be over 200 on each tour. These tours are very informative so worthwhile. The grounds are huge so wear appropriate footwear as you will do many steps throughout the day. We queued for around 30 minutes to see the Crown Jewels but again the queue went in fast. It was worthwhile as the jewels are spectacular. Be sure to go see the ravens whilst you are there, such beautiful animals."
"May 21, 2023",Great historical visit,This is a great place to visit on a first London trip.  The history is amazing and everything is very well presented and maintained.  The audio guide helps give lots of information to enhance your journey through the various areas of the Tower.  Great views and helps with the understanding of what things were like in their time.  Staff was great and very helpful.  
"May 21, 2023",History and Jewels,"You can't go to London and not visit.  If you like British history or royal jewels, this is the place.  We had our own guide.  This was really nice.  The Beefeater tours looked like they had too many people on them.  We were there just a few days after the coronation and most of the items were back.  Amazing to see them up close after just seeing them being worn and used by King Charles."
"May 20, 2023",Not wonderful,Underwhelmed by sparse and dated display. Waited a very long time to see the Crown Jewels which were not at all well labelled. A shame to have paid so much for entry.
"May 20, 2023",Beef Eater Tour,My daughter and I visited today and joined in a tour with  yeoman warder scott Kelly #Beefy409 had an awesome tour Beefy409 was  extremely informative and entertaining anyone visiting I would urge to to take his tour if he’s available  Huzzah!!!
"May 19, 2023",Top notch,Always have a wonderful time in London we all went here as a family and spent the whole afternoon looking around. So much to do and very interesting. Superb . Only thing that wasn’t great was the weather.
"May 19, 2023",Big Castle,Speaking freely with the various Beefeater Wardens was great. We chose not to join one of the tours as it. Was just too many people. Pro tip.... Go early and go directly to the crown jewels . It took us less than 10 minutes to enter. Take the walk around the top of the wall.
"May 19, 2023",A fascinating place but beware of the crowds,"The Tower of London is an iconic tourist attraction and the tourists flock here in such vast numbers that it can be a trying day out to enjoy this historic site. Take the Underground to Tower Hill station and it is only a short walk away. I strongly recommend arriving before the opening at 9:00 as the queue was already about 200m long to enter when we arrived shortly thereafter. As soon as you get in, make haste to go straight to the Crown Jewels exhibit and don’t even think about looking at anything else. If you head straight there the queue is very short but leave it too long and the line up becomes out of control. There will be plenty of time later to back track and explore the other parts of the site. The Yeoman’s tours are well worth the time and leave every 30 mins. You will get a colourful and humorous presentation of the historic site, including details you otherwise would not ever know about. In my opinion, avoid the tour that departs at 10:00 because it is far too crowded. Other later tours were much less so. After visiting the site, take a walk over the nearby Tower Bridge and up the right to the Borough Markets for lunch. They have an amazing array of food to choose from."
"May 18, 2023",Great place to visit to learn about the History of London,"Had a great day at The Tower of London. So much more to see & learn than I realised. Lots of History , but not boring ! Great views of the Thames, The Shard & Tower Bridge too The Beefeaters were all lovely , friendly & helpful "
"May 18, 2023",Excelkebt- arrive early beat the masses,Excellent value. Arrived at 8.30 for our 9 entry and were able to see opening ceremony. Also very quiet to see crown jewels. Fascinating seeing graffiti left behind by prisoners. Friendly staff 
"May 31, 2023",Excellent Tower of London Experience,"We visited the Tower of London on 27 April 2023. Our Yeoman Warder guide was A.J., the 2nd female Beefeater in history. She was informative and highly entertaining. If you want to tour the White Tower, just know there are MANY steps! Because we visited shortly before the Coronation, the Crown Jewels had left the building. But wandering through the various open buildings was very enjoyable.  If those walls could talk, what stories they’d tell."
"June 29, 2022",Super bloom and tower,Did Superbloom and Tower what a great day….three adults and a six year old had the best time….first was Superbloom in the moat then the Tower itself - self guided - did crown Jewell’s. Wonderful value for money can only recommend
"August 25, 2021",A London Must See,Fascinating tour around this historical palace/zoo/prison/museum. Spent approximately 3 hours exploring it and loved it. Spent a bit extra getting the headphones/audio guide which was well worth it.  A London must see!
"April 9, 2023",Awful. Staff a disgrace (Yeoman excluded),"Horrendously organised, all staff bar Yeoman disgraceful. They were rude, highly unprofessional and swearing a lot regardless of who was in earshot. Queue for the jewels so badly organised. For an iconic landmark it’s an embarrassment and a shambles. "
"August 12, 2021",Must do!,"Great day out. We arrived for 9am -queued for a few minutes to get in (ticket check) and walked straight to the Crown jewels as there was no queue at this time and not many people in at the time. Spent the rest of the time exploring the other areas.  Lots to see, lots of history, some great views and photo opportunities. Suitable for young and old."
"June 11, 2022","Awesome Visit, A Must See",Took the 45 guided yeoman tour and it was well worth it. It comes with the price of admission so take advantage. You get to learn about 900 years of history in the short 45 minute time.
"January 25, 2020",Very interesting historical place,"First time visit, not too busy in January, no queues. The beefeater tour is a must, so informative and brings it all to life. The displays in the armoury are magnificent and the Crown Jewels are beautiful. It’s a great area too, we took a 5 minute walk to St Katherine’s Dock where we had a drink in the Dickins Inn. Will definitely revisit the area. "
"April 7, 2022",A day at the tower ,"Overall I really enjoyed checking out the Tower of London. First of all the grounds are visually stunning, especially if you're into older architecture in. Once inside, it's really just a museum detailing the history of the tower. There are several things of interest there my favorite being the crown jewels exhibit. The only thing I would caution about is that there are a lot of stairs so one should be extra careful if you're older, or bringing young children. Well worth checking out. "
"December 18, 2023",Tower of London tour,A wonderful tour. The Beefeater first introduced us to the history with great humor and facts. Don’t miss this part.  Then we went out on our own to see the Crown Jewels and the tower itself. The history is fascinating and worth the time.
"April 8, 2022",Incredible journey through British history,WOW! A fantastic visit where the Beefeaters hooked us from the first moment. From 10-70yrs everyone was hanging off his every word. The Tower is an incredible building but it is the Beefeater guide who brings it to life. MUST DO experience for everyone in London.
"July 7, 2022","Worth it, and bigger then expected","I was positively surprised about the visit to the Tower of London. The grounds, number of buildings, and also the exhibits are bigger and more as expected. We spent almost 4 hours there. We did not see the Crown Jewels, as the line was multiple-hours waiting long; our mistake, as when we arrived (early) there was no line, but we decided to visit the White Tower, when we came out, the line had formed, so when you see that the line is short, take it."
"December 6, 2023",A must see,"Its well-preserved and impressive architecture is a sight to behold. It is filled with fascinating stories and history that will make any visit memorable. It is a must-see for anyone interested in learning more about England's past. The tour guides are knowledgeable and friendly, and the grounds are beautiful."
"February 7, 2022",So Interesting,My wife and I have visited the Tower many times but it is endlessly fascinating. We have still not seen all there is to see. As it was fairly quiet when we visited we spent a lot of time looking at the Crown Jewels. Staff are very helpful and friendly. Highly recommended.
"January 23, 2020",Great day out,"I have visited the Tower on previous occasions as I live locally. Today I went with my family and joined the Yoeman guided tour for the first time. The tour and stories told by Yoeman Scott Kelly were fantastic and brought the Tower to life. There is a lot to see, we spent a good part of the afternoon there and shall be returning very soon. Thank you!"
"August 11, 2022",Grubby toilets,"I needed to use the toilets while visiting the area near the Tower. I was pointed in the direction to go only to find that it was wrong and was then given the correct directions. However when I reached the toilets I found there was a fee of 50p to pay. I paid and thought that the facilities would be clean, new and well maintained. Wrong. they were grubby, and could have done with some mointenance. A rip off."
"September 20, 2021",Overpriced and not that interesting,"A larger area than I expected. We did not have any guided tours available when we went, so meandered around. I personally did not find it interesting. Lots of empty rooms, some info in some rooms, the crown jewels were fascinating.Apparently, if you manage to find a guided tour, its much more immersive and interesting. A pity then, we could not find one.Would I go again? Not at the admission price for the experience we had."
"November 4, 2022",The Tower of London is filled with delightful and grisly information,"We went on a Tower of London tour and I'm so glad we did. Our tour guide was hilarious and well-informed. The stories he told add to the magnificence of the place. Pretty gruesome! The space was larger than I thought, with so many buildings, all with their own stories. And the Crown Jewels are spectacular. My favorite part was the armor worn by  horses. I have horses myself and I can't imagine hucking that heavy metal equipment on their backs. Tower of London is a must see."
"August 29, 2023",Great historical day out,Tower of London was a great day out. We had booked for 11am but wished we had booked earlier..there was so much to see! The tour was great and our guard was very entertaining. Kids (9 and 13) found everything really interesting and really enjoyed themselves. Food is pricey as expected (£17 for 3 slices of cake!). Top tips-would be wear comfy shoes…we did so much walking backwards and forwards and there are lots of steps. - wait till later in the afternoon for Crown Jewels..the queue was pretty much non existent mid afternoon onwards
"October 8, 2021",Magnificent eloquently description from past to present.,"Great history of London from the start, haw it has evolved to become the present. So much to see and learn. Advise to first take a guided narrative tour a must! Go about on your own or narrated headphone tour. Expect to spend around 4hrs average, could be more if you stop and enjoy every little detail. Cheers!"
"August 19, 2022",Incredibly majestic and beautiful,One of the highlights when one travels in London!  It is a must see. A sight with great character and a lot of tourism around.  It is very close to Chad Thames and all the River Thames nearby attractions. Very easy to go on foot from anywhere and it has wonderful places to sit as well as live attractions (specially during the summer time).  Check it out!
"May 2, 2023",Tower Tour,Wide variety of some of London's history inside. Be sure to take the yeoman warden (Beefeater) tour.
"May 2, 2023","Worth the visit - online tickets are non-refundable tho, so may be worth buying once you reach","Booked Tower of London tickets for the wrong date on Viator and then realized they are completely non-refundable. Really not sure why since later when I booked for the right date and we reached there a few minutes later than our slot, we were just waved in - noone even checked our tickets or scanned the QR code! I feel given this level of openness when we actually turn up there, the Historic Royal Palaces should allow for cancelling or rescheduling... Anyway the Tower of London itself is fabulous - the views, the turrets, the exhibitions inside. Do take the free beefeater tour from the entrance which runs every hour at half past, it is amazing. We had a lady (I forget her name) who was so amusing and had so many fun stories. Missed the crown jewels since we went late in the afternoon and the line was a mile long. "
"May 2, 2023",Good to see the English History,"The Tower of London, Looks amazingly well kept and as sold at the ticket counter is the oldest building in London. We arrived at 11am bank holiday Monday and There was no queue purchase tickets, adults were £29.99 each and our children had blue Peter badges so they go in free which was a bonus. Again no queue to get into the tower, we headed straight to the Crown Jewels, there was a small queue but went quick. We were told that some items were no on display due to the up coming coronation, which were a considerable part of the display, the conveyor belts were perfect kept people moving but then it was mayhem trying to see the gold prices on the cabinets, people did not want to move at all so this took some time. Conveyer belts throughout the Crown Jewels would be much better. We then made our way around the tower which was interesting and our children particularly liked the Torture chamber, there was also a great little Victorian era comedy show on the grass area all about the upcoming coronation of King Charles the 2nd. Very funny. We had a cake and coffee in the cafe on site, nice coffee shop, plenty of sandwiches, scones, cakes and drinks to choose from and reasonably priced too. Disappointingly we totally missed the white tower entrance so missed seeing the armoury, we also couldn’t seem to time the Yeoman warden talks so missed those too but they were really busy and had crowds around them when we saw them going on. I was surprised to not see any yeoman just walking around the grounds really. Ravens were kept in enclosures I assume this was due to bird flu, unless they are always kept in cages, I remember going as a child and I’m sure they were free roaming. There was plenty of clean toilets which is always good!"
"May 1, 2023",Tower of London,I loved the tour to the London tower! It was probably the highlight of my trip. So much history! Our beefeater was very knowledgeable and extremely funny! 
"May 1, 2023",Entertaining but…,"Tour was good, but too many people in the group.  I had taken a tour previously and a much smaller groups where you go inside with the guide too.  I don’t recall through which tour group, but thought that was better.  Go early as the line for the jewels was too long."
"May 1, 2023",Great Beefeater Tour!,Had the best Beefeatertour with yeoman Hardy!!! We enjoyed it very much and would highly recommend it when visiting the Tower of London!
"April 30, 2023",Bucket List - check,"The Tower of London tour WITH one of 35 Beefeaters.  He lives, with his family, and works in the Tower grounds and helps maintain the Crown Jewels. He will be in the coronation parade on Saturday. Great tour and he is a great speaker and entertainer! This was a bucket list item.  "
"April 30, 2023",Very historic but overall lacking in content.,The guided tour was very informative and the tour guide made it fun.  The historic nature of the site is amazing.  However the amount of items on display is lacking.  I was there many years ago and have pictures of many more artifacts on display.  There is much to be improved upon and for 37 pounds you would expect more.  7.9 out of 10.
"April 29, 2023",Great Place and Great History,"The Tower of London was amazing. I had no idea how old it was yet its in fantastic shape. Just loved learning the history of what happened there. We got there before it opened so we were able to walk right in and see the Crown Jewels. It was cool to see them, but bummed that we couldn't see everything cause some were not there, as they were being prepared for the coronation. I did buy a book about them and got a few other cool things. Well worth the time!"
"April 28, 2023","Underwhelming, but ok","It was ok, but kind of overrated and underwhelming. I like history, so it was kind of interesting but it just wasn't as good as some of the other places around."
"March 30, 2022",Fantastic Yeomans tour,Our second visit but this time we joined a Yeomans tour and we were so glad we did. Really informative and great fun. Crown Jewels are amazing. Lots of things to see. We took our own food and sat on a bench in the sunshine. A fantastic day out. We used bogof voucher on daysout website with our train ticket.
"January 4, 2020",Must visit,"This is a must see. Crown Jewels, robes and other Royal artifacts are incredible.  The  prison and other historic events that even if you aren’t a history buff, is fascinating. US has nothing like this  This represents London as much as Buckingham palace does"
"January 18, 2020",Tower of London,We saw the Tower of London on the left when we walked across the Tower Bridge. We saw the Tower where the Crown Jewels are kept but didn’t go in as it was closed. There was a ice rink at the other end of Tower but we walked towards Tower Hill Underground to get back. 
"July 25, 2023",Tower of London Jewel of the crown, So I have tried 4 times in my lifetime to visit and in particularly the Jewels.  Managed it today after the typical British queue system  . Liked the travelator  in crown room  could be done elsewhere too.  Ideally needs more seating along queue  routes .    Need more than one day to see it all.    History at its best. Sad to see Ravens are caged . But can understand why. 
"February 18, 2020",Awesome!,The Tower of London was an awesome trip. Our tour guide was funny and made the area actually fun. It was nice to see the Crown Jewels as well. It was a very long line but it went quickly. The jewels were beautiful. 
"July 8, 2022",Superblooms on display,"Pre booked free tickets to Superblooms , the flower display in the ditch/moat. Not fully in bloom due to late season but still excellent. Have been to the Tower before but you see and learn something new each time. A slice of history and would recommend it to anyone. Can spend a day here."
"August 15, 2021","Educational, Scenic & Entertaining - So Pleased We Made the Effort","Such a lovely day out! Educational and entertaining, we really enjoyed our visit. So much trouble had been taken to ensure it was Covid-friendly.  Beautiful surrounds - very atmospheric and grand. So much space, so even when it was busy we felt we had lots of room. Friendly and attentive staff. Kicking myself it took a pandemic to visit. Funny how we don't support UK tourism until going abroad is not an option. My husband and I got as much out of it as our children did. Learnt a few new historical facts! Would highly recommend "
"August 1, 2023",Bringing History to Life.,"Pre-booked our tickets and decided to visit early on in the day to avoid the queues. The whole place is enchanting and steeped in history. You can have a Beefeater tour, and their knowledge is second to none. You do have to be fairly fit to be able to explore many parts of the site, and there are a lot of steps, but it was a truly fascinating place to explore, with the crown jewels being centre stage. There are a couple of places to regenerate the batteries, and a coffee cost £3.20. Well worth a visit and there a few hands on activities for children too. "
"May 19, 2022",Don’t miss this!,"Apparently the Tower lost its 1st place tourist destination to the London Eye some time ago. Having done both, this is the one I would go back to see again. The Eye is great but the Tower is in a league of its own. It’s easy to navigate if you don’t have mobility issues and is just chock full of amazing artifacts and history."
"July 12, 2022",What a walk through History,"The tower of London is always a must see! You can easily spend the day here and you wouldn't regret it. Between the crown jewels and the tower itself as well as the rest of the castle, there is so much.What a wonderful place. "
"September 12, 2021",An attraction on our London attraction itinerary,Just fantastic. Booked on line to ensure entrance. Probably the best day we had of the whole week. Spotlessly clean everywhere. Well organised entry and then left to do your own thing. Beefeaters on hand for questions and also to provide information.
"June 3, 2022",Excellent,Iconic location and for good reason.  One minute to get in and just a few minutes to wait for the Crown Jewels.  There is loads to see and great photo opportunities of Tower Bridge and the City.It's a definite must see
"April 9, 2021",History is Living and Breathing Here!,"A tourist destination for sure. But, if you at all enjoy or have read or studied English history. It is a MUST. I was honestly in awe that I was even walking the same ground that so many had walked before and all of the historical events that changed the shape of history. Take your time, really walk around. Talk to some of the ravens (beware, they love Pringles....lol). I would suggest you read before you go a recent book released by the Ravenmaster at the Tower. "
"July 16, 2022",So much history...,"We spent almost five hours going through the Tower of London. There is so much history in one place. We were lucky enough to get there first thing in the morning, and got in to see the crown jewels right away. When we came out there was a daunting line that went on and on and on. I was grateful NOT to be in it. Be sure to get the audio tour, as it is worth it to hear the stories behind the history of what you are seeing."
"June 14, 2022",London History galore,"If you want to see some history of London, then this is a great place to visit. There are a lot of towers to visit which will provide some background on various historical figures and events. Arguably, the crown jewels are the best part so definitely make a stop there. It can get quite crowded so prepare for a wait to see them. But it is worth it."
"July 15, 2022",Great Historic Experience,Visited the Tower of London later in the day and the crowds weren’t bad. Caught the last Yeoman Warden Tour with Andy and it was fantastic.  Andy schools you on what his position is all about and the history of the historic Tower.  All with a great sense of humor despite the dark history.  Very informative and entertaining.  Highly recommend the experience.  The facility has a lot going on so plan to spend some time.
"February 25, 2020",One of most famous and interesting place in London,One of the most famous place of interest in London! I was dreaming about visiting it and I wasn’t disappointed!! It takes about 2-3 to walk around there. I would suggest coming early so you won’t stay in line to see the crown jewels. The night view of the Tower of London is fascinating!
"September 4, 2020",Definitely worth visiting,Great day out at the Tower. Quite a lot open and no queues for anything so we were able to relax and take our time. The exhibitions in the buildings were good and the Yeoman Warders and other staff were happy to answer any questions. The Crown Jewels are really spectacular and we had them almost to ourselves. Social distancing etc well managed without feeling intrusive. Definitely recommended to visit.
"June 23, 2023",Oozing history,My suggestion is go early to avoid the lines. It's fun and informative specially chatting to people working there. Beefeater AJ was a delight and Warden Luis was just so knowledgeable. They really make the history come alive.
"June 7, 2022",A Must Stop for a First Timer,The Tower of London is a must stop for a first time visitor. I recommend getting there on opening and starting at the back of the complex and working you way up. Pro tip to escape the crowd going from the front to the back. The crown jewels are a sight to be held. We intended on spending an hour or so here but ended up spending 3! We really enjoyed it and highly recommend.
"January 30, 2023",Tour of London tower,"Guide was awesome.  Chatty, detailed explanations & very funny. Our Guide, a Beefeater,  was Andy.. or Shady!  He really made our tour worth every step.Fabulous tour, incite, and humor really was great."
"June 4, 2022","Historical, interesting","Really interesting, full of history place. Might not be push chair/wheel chair friendly if you want to see displays in the towers. Beefeaters everywhere and keen to pose for pictures. Allow good 3 hours to see everything and read all the displays . Kids started to be a bit bored, but ice creams half they though the visit kept them going"
"January 19, 2020",Tower of London,"Excellent trip to tower of London yeoman guide was excellent, great fun but also gave great information.When paying for ticket lady was rude asking us were we from northern Ireland or the other one. We are indeed from the Republic of Ireland ."
"March 10, 2020",Great place to go for history ,"Great visit enjoyed the history, fantastic especially for foreign visitors to learn about London. Cafes and shops on site, toilets clearly signed. Can get great photos in front of the guards outside where the Crown Jewels are. "
"January 23, 2020",Fantastic yeoman beefeater tour with Scott Kelly,We took the after lunch tour and it was fantastic. Informative and entertaining. Totally the best thing we did in London this trip. Cannot recommend more. Scott was outstanding. So glad we did the tour with him. Do not miss. Well done!!!
"September 1, 2020",Not what I expected,"Only took about an hour to get round, Not really much to see even if everything was open which it wasn’t.Queues for white tower and Crown Jewels were never ending.Best bit was walking along with a raven as he didn’t seem at all bothered by humans."
"January 26, 2020",A London Must-See,"Plan to spend at least a half day.  Highlights include the Crown Jewels and the armor display in the White Tower.  The chapel is also interesting as are the various displays on incarceration and torture in the tower. Make time to do a tour with a beefeater.  They are very informative and humorous. Beware, pavement is not always smooth and the armor tour has a lot of stairs. "
"May 10, 2023",Really worth a visit - free carer ticket,"My boyfriend and I visited here as part of our trip to London and it was so educational. The guards did a tour about the background of the tower, and how it came about. There are museums in the tower, as well as The Crown Jewels, which is the only place where you are not allowed to take pictures. Everything is beautifully set out. "
"August 19, 2022",Must Return,"The Tower of London has history all around it, literally. While enjoying a walk along the riverside, you can also enjoy stopping at the many plaques that line The Tower. You get to learn a lot of history and fun facts of select areas of The Tower. Unfortunately when we arrived, it was just before closing, so we were unable to access The Tower. There are a ton of food vendors along the riverside to sit, enjoy something to eat, and overlook the massive impact The Tower has."
"July 18, 2021",Could be better.,"We visited today and had an okay time exploring this historically amazing place. We did feel more could be done to bring the tower to life, lots of huge rooms that are almost empty. This place has so much history, yet what’s on show and portrayed barely scratches the surface.The staff weren’t particularly helpful, the team on the gate weren’t friendly and the guy serving ice creams by the white tower was a miserable so and so. He made it clear he hated his job.Would I visit again, probably not."
"February 18, 2023",Took the grndchildren at holiday time,"Fantastic place to spend a few hours , also taking ina cruise along the Thames form Westminster and back. Fairly crowded and long queues for some things.Best , if not with children to go in term time. Or persuade the teacher to let them go in term time asa superb educational day !"
"March 11, 2023",Very interesting,"Fascinating. Only wished I could have stayed longer than the 2 hours I had allowed.  I used the audio tour, but personally found it better without the headphones, as there is enough information everywhere and I felt I could soak up the atmosphere better."
"July 7, 2022",Beautiful,"The Tower of London was fantastic. You marvel at the history that happened here and the overall historical significance. The grounds were terrific, with many buildings and exhibits to explore. Make sure you arrive early and head to the Crown Jewels first, a must, as lines get extremely long. Make sure you chat with the friendly Beefeaters and/or hit one of their tours up."
"September 24, 2022",Excellent visit,The Tower is a very interesting place to visit. There is such a lot to see. Go early and get straight in to see the Crown Jewels which had just been returned after Her late Majesty's   funeral when we visited. Amazing!! Really good cafe as well. Allow at least three hours to see most of the place
"March 11, 2020",Birthday visit ,"The Tower Of London is always a pleasure to visit, and we always find something new that we've never seen before. It's quite a trek in some places, especially the White Tower which has over 200 steps, so if you have problems in that department it's going to be quite a struggle. Other than that it's a perfect place to discover England's troubled past monarchy, with help along the way from the trusty beefeaters. Well recommended. "
"October 30, 2022",A beautiful piece of history,"Loved visiting the Tower.  Truly excellent, should have done it years ago.  We entered on a 10 am slot and left just after 1.  Not long enough!  You need five hours minimum really to see everything.Worth a visit."
"March 28, 2023",Interesting,We went into The Tower of London not having a lot of knowledge. It was a huge place. I wish we would’ve had more time to spend there. I feel that we didn’t get to see everything. It has a fascinating history.  If we come back to London I’d like to go back and spend more time there.
"August 20, 2020",Brilliant  !! ....really worth a visit ,"Getting to the end of the long Summer holidays with kids trying to think of something different to do. This really was a great  day out for us all.The staff were delightful , very helpful and. informative . Seeing the crown Jewels was definitely the high light of the day. It wasn't  busy so we went round a few times to look  at it all again."
"December 31, 2022",Long queues,"Came here on the weekend of the queens jubilee for a walk around. The area was packed, the tower looked impressive. The grass verges round the outside could’ve done with a tidy up, didn’t go inside due to queues"
"January 8, 2020",Tower of London,"Lots to see on this great visit. We were lucky that there weren't big crowds, didn't have to queue for anything. The Crown Jewels were amazing. Simple things like the Ravens were great to see, and the place where Anne Boleyn was executed. Highly recommended."
"March 12, 2023",Tower of London tour,"Had the absolute pleasure yesterday (11th March) to join the tour lead by Beey409. What a star! Brilliantly funny, informative and exceptional people skills. He made our day at the tower.  Thank you for a marvellous experience."
"June 28, 2021",Loose yourself in History,Spent five hours enjoying the Awesome History of this incredible castle. Wonderful experience. The only downside was that the Beefeaters were not carrying out their usual tours due to Covid restrictions. Do have the Audio Tour as this gives you so much information. great day out.
"August 13, 2021",Great time had by all,Got there at 10am and went straight to the Crown Jewels as advised and there was no queue. Went another couple of hours wandering around the sight. Very informative. Spoke to a guide who was very knowledgeable. Great morning out. Even the teens enjoyed it.
"July 14, 2022",Second visit,"Our daughter’s a true historian so was desperate to return to this place. Loads to see on a hot sunny day, with a welcome AC break inside the buildings. Not a lot to occupy younger visitors (unless they’re great readers) but otherwise very enjoyable."
"May 20, 2022",Don't lose your head,"Spent a whole afternoon exploring the Tower and all it's nooks and crannies, a great experience.Got to see the range of crown jewels and learn about the history of the items, many in use since the 1600's!Loved the way the crown jewels exhibition operates using a slowly moving level travellator......... meaning everyone gets to see the artifacts without having to push and shove :-)Check out the Railways 2 for 1 admission offerAn excellent visit topped off with a stroll across Tower Bridge."
"August 26, 2021",Crown Jewels Amazing,Highlight for us was the Crown Jewels.  Amazing how close you can get.  Bit disappointed with the dungeons etc - was expecting a bit more if you have been to Warwick Castle I think you will be disappointed.  Cafe expensive e.g. £2.30 for a can but it is London. 45 min tour free which was ok but expected more of a tour than being talked at.  Kids free with their blue Peter badges.
"April 25, 2022",Do Not Miss!,This is a must do attraction whist visiting London.  It will take you a half day to tour completely.  Difficult if you have a wheelchair and some parts are not wheelchair accessible but still worth seeing.  Beefeater tour/commentary are fun and informative and free!  Crown jewels are not to be missed.  So much history within these walls!
"July 28, 2021",Family visit,"Excellent day well laid out, we were able to visit all attractions without queuing. Lots of interesting places to visit. We saw some filing taking place. Staff were friendly and helpful and we look forward to visiting again"
"September 25, 2023",Visit whilst on London,Visited whilst on a trip to London. Only had 2 hours but managed to see most things. Very interesting historically. Beefeaters need training in customer service ( which is ultimately what their job is) bit impatient  and miserable. Most looks a bit overgrown and scruffy 
"November 5, 2023",Not the best today,"Plus points: Historic site and lots of different things to see including the Crown Jewels. Downside: staff rude and unfriendly (not the Beefeaters), not very mobility friendly (expected to not be flat/escalators etc, but asking for the easiest route should have not led to such sarcasm), gluten free cookie so hard we couldn't eat it and was just told ""I'll tell the chef"" . £4.95 wasted. Only there 1.5 hour as went early so no queues which great but meant a quick visit. "
"May 3, 2006",Absolutely Unmissable,"I'll start by saying - if you visit London, visit the Tower of London at ALL COSTS!!We booked in advance over the Internet, this way you avoid having to queue at the ticket machines etc, you can just walk straight in. The tours start from just past the entrance, and are done by a Yeoman guard (Beefeater). They are free - and timed, and are WELL worth doing - the Beefeaters reveal lots of facts and are really amusing, making jokes about various things. You also get to go into the Chapel - which you cannot do otherwise.Other things to see in the Tower are the Crown Jewels of course, Traiters Gate, Bloody Tower, and the most famous of all - the White Tower (which you can explore, it holds many things like guns, suits of armour etc).Make sure your camera has a massive memory card!"
"April 24, 2005",Bring your walking shoes!,"The Tower of London is an absolute ""must see"" for anyone visiting London.  The exhibit of the Crown jewels is breathtaking.  And don't miss the armor in the White Tower- it is outstanding. It was a relief to realize that they have toilets inside the tour area.  But bring your favorite pair of comfy shoes- the lines were long, and the walking up the stairs, and down the stairs will set your feet on fire if you're not careful.  Hint- if you are using the London Tour busses to get around, be sure to buy your Tower tickets from them.  The price is the same, and you avoid the queue at the Tower ticket line."
"March 30, 2005",Great place to spend a few hours,"My daughter and I spent several hours at the Tower of London.  There is a lot to see. and it's all very interesting.  Be prepared for lots of walking - particularly up and down narrow stairs and circular staircases.  If you have young children, you may want to skip the Bloody Tower - they show how several forms of torture were performed.  Even I found it disturbing."
"February 9, 2005",Loved seeing crown jewels. but the Beefeaters are wonderful,Very interesting.  Beefeaters stories are wonderful.  Must Must wear comfy thick sole shoes..cobblestone and stairs are hard on the feet.  I would love to see all the sites there again.  Fabulous. The chapel and story is intriguing. 
"July 11, 2003","""Whose keys?""  ""Queen Elizabeth's keys!""","Security makes for ceremony at the Tower of London. Every night for 700 years, the Ceremony of the Keys has been performed inside the walls of the Tower. Of the thousands who visit the Tower each week, only a handful of visitors glimpse this after-hours pagentry. We'll give a quick overview of the ceremony and tell you how to arrange tickets to this special London event.While the Tower of London has evolved from palace and prison to tourist attraction, the ritual locking of the Tower's gates has changed very little. The Tower's gate is locked, the keys are accompanied uniformed escort, and the Chief Yeoman Warder and Tower's military guards recite a precise challenge-and-pass routine:""Halt, who comes there?"" demands the guard.""The Keys!"" replies the Chief Yeoman Warder.""Whose Keys?"" counters the guard.""Queen Elizabeth's Keys"" is the Chief Yeoman's response.""Pass Queen Elizabeth's Keys"" replies the sentry, ""and all's well""An assembled guard salutes, the Chief Yeoman shouts ""God preserve Queen Elizabeth"", a bugler sounds, and the ceremony ends. Only ten minutes has passed, but those who see the Ceremony of the Keys seem to have stepped back through 700 years of history.How can you attend the ceremony? Send for a ticket as far in advance as possible (six months ahead is not too soon). Write to:The Ceremony of the Keys Waterloo Block, HM Tower of London London, UK EC3N 4ABIn your letter include the date you want to attend (give a few alternate dates), the number of people in your party (maximum is 7 6 from April through October and 15 during other months), and the names and addresses of everyone who will attend. Send the letter along with a self-addressed envelope and an two international postal reply coupons (available at US post offices) to cover the return postage."
"November 4, 2005",Great Experience,"We spent about 3.5 hours at the Tower of London, well worth the price of admission.  If you have am AMA membership there is a 50% discount on the second ticket.  We did not take the Beefeater tour, but took the self guiding audio tour instead.  Really enjoyed it, the audio tour was very informative and it allowed us to go at our own pace.  Followed the advise of all the guide books and headed straight to the crown jewels.  They really are incredible, went around the circuit several times to get the full effect.  The White tower is not included on the audio tour, but is well worth checking out.  Take the time to explore this building.  There are lots and lots of stairs at the tower and it is all built out of stone including the sidewalks so wear good solid shoes.  No heals, and nothing fancy, wear shoes with good support and some cushioning.This is a great sight for all travellers and all ages.  Highly recommend it."
"September 21, 2004",Tower of London Key Ceremony - well worth the trouble,"The Ceremony of the Keys is the short ceremonial lock-up of the Tower, which is done every night with a limited attendance- you get to get into the Tower at night, without crowds, witness centuries-old pomp, with enjoyable commentary by one of the ""warders."" You need to send to the Tower for tickets - directions are on the Tower's website; the visit is well worth the little bit of trouble."
"April 9, 2019","Good, but pricey ","This was an amazing experience for our little ones, learning about the history of kings and queens. The crown jewel sections were really fascinating! However it was massively overpriced for what it was. It took us 2 hours to go round it all. It’s open gardens and buildings for you to stroll around as you please. It’s easier if you go in order but it’s not necessary. Had to pay extra for the audio guide or any books or leaflets associated with it. Was £30 a ticket! Booking online makes it cheaper"
"June 25, 2018",Expedia - Bit of a con,I bought the tickets through Expedia only to find the Crown Jewels and the Beefeater Tour are free.  There was no speedy entrance as we all went in through the same entrance.So just go and buy them on the gate.However - the place and tour and jewels are really great to see and was great to walk about and see the place at our own leisure.  
"October 10, 2007",Fantastic! Be prepared and you'll love it!,"I absolutely love the Tower of London, something about all the history and so much happening between those walls really intrigues me, and obviously a lot of other people too if its popularity is anything to go by. To get maximum enjoyment out of your day there I suggest you read up on the history of it and the people it involves before you go, it makes the stories you're told on the tour all the more fascinating and greatly increases your enjoyment of the entire Tower. I bought a book from the gift shop and carried it through with me and read about the individual buildings as I was standing there, the impact is bigger than if you buy it later and read it when you've left.The Tower has so much to see and is usually pretty packed, so you'll need a full day at least. Try and get in the queue for the Crown Jewels early so you don't have to wait as long and don't miss the guided tours, they're brilliant.Over all it's one of Londons highlights and it's one attraction you definitely don't want to miss!"
"March 16, 2023",Fantastic stop,"The entire place is loaded with history and kept in pristine condition! Personal favorite was the crown jewels, we did have to wait about 35 minutes to get in but well worth it."
"March 16, 2023","Looks expensive, but when you add up what you get for your money, I think it's good value.","You get a site tour, the crown jewels, the White Tower, a museum, a church, the walls walk and the ravens. I last visited 10 years ago and was concerned the tour guides might have gone 'woke' over the years - no way.  The Yeoman Warders are just as 'salty' and humorous as they were in 2013. And they are also informative.The easily offended may force themselves to be offended, but the crowd reaction underlined that he (Scott Kelly)  hit the right notes for his audience.If you've got the time to spare (I was there for 4 hours - and I don't dawdle) get yourself along to the Tower. Great place."
"March 16, 2023",The Tower of London tower,"Absolutely had an amazing time, soo much history and knowledge learned through an amazing guide Mark the beafeater. Thank you soo much to everyone"
"March 15, 2023",spring 2023,"well worth the money,travel by train and get a 2 for 1 voucher.Try to get in early and head for the crown jewles first,then do the battlements and other places"
"March 14, 2023",Good history lession,An afternoon trip to the tower of london was good to be exposed to some English royal history.The line to the crown jewels was really really long so we had to skip it. Probably best to visit first thing in the morning rather than after lunch
"March 14, 2023",Great place to visit.,"Once inside, we had a free tour with the lovely and very funny Yeoman Warder, David Coleman. He told us all we needed to know about the tower.  Very much recommended."
"March 13, 2023",Jewel in the crown of a weekend,"We had a wonderful visit to the Tower of London and it is at least 30 years since my last visit. my wife, her sister, and my brother in law had never been before. We did not join the Yeoman Warder tour as we wanted to discover things for ourselves. It meant that we had time and space to read and look at all the exhibits, also taking in the spaces that they were being housed, the tour was so large that it could not get everybody into some rooms. The Fusilier's museum and the Bloody Tower, gave an insight to the history of the people involved and the battlements and gates gave the history of the changing face of the tower. The rooms where prisoners were held and the places where executions were carried out were graphically described. Although the piece de resistance being the Jewel Vault and it's contents. The door to the vault is interesting in itself but the magnificence of the contents of the room took your breath away. I cannot really find words to describe the instruments and paraphernalia of the symbols of Monarchy. All in all a wonderful visit, so much so, we bought a yearly ticket to revisit because we were sure we missed  a lot. Maybe we will join a Warden Yoeman's tour next month when we revisit."
"March 12, 2023",Amazing experience!!,What an experience! The tour is about an hour and a half but it goes fast…you get to learn so many facts and the beefeaters are very funny!  If you’re in London it’s a must do tour!
"March 12, 2023",Compared to the big skyscrapers it looks small from outside ...,". . . but from inside - wow! It is very important to have enough time to ""enjoy"" because there is so much to see."
"March 12, 2023",Tower of London tour,"Had the absolute pleasure yesterday (11th March) to join the tour lead by Beey409. What a star! Brilliantly funny, informative and exceptional people skills. He made our day at the tower.  Thank you for a marvellous experience."
"March 24, 2005",A great history lesson and a must for Brits,"I personally am not bothered by the Royal family, but this tells you your own country's history that they don't bother to teach you in schools. I learnt more about it here than I ever did in school! It really is informative and educational and you get to go around practically the whole thing. It really should be made a compulsory school trip for kids in this country. The best part of it was the crown jewels for me.Just a shame it was ruined by a group of school age tourists that had asbsoultely no respect for others and where they were."
"February 6, 2005",JEWELS,"Extensive museums showing weaponry gets a bit tediuos if you're not into that sort of thing, but the part you can't miss is the Crown Jewels.  Breathtaking.  Very easy to loop back into line to see them again if you want as long as it's not a hugely busy day.  Be sure to walk across Tower Bridge and perhaps visit The HMS Belfast for some great WWII naval history and just enjoy the few from the other side of the Thames."
"November 25, 2021",Gorgeous,Stunning buildings and the crown jewels are gorgeous. I really liked to see the ravens. The exhibitions are well-made and interesting.
"June 30, 2018",Great attraction - very crowded!,"We loved the Tower and the history. However, knowing how crowed it can get ( visited 3 years ago) we got to the location extra early and were among the first people to arrive and bought our tickets in advance on line.  We wanted to be given a tour by one of the Yeoman warders and told to wait until 10 o clock in a designated area. Well by 10 there were over 300 people waiting for the tour to begin. We tried to follow him, but with the large crowd could not hear his presentation. Realize you cannot do anything about the crowds, but would hope the first to arrive would be rewarded by fewer people. "
"April 4, 2017",An amazing attraction steeped in history.,"We had another enjoyable visit to the Tower of London.There is so much history and my favourite part was seeing the Crown Jewels, they are so beautiful and well displayed so you get a good look at them.The ‘Beefeater’ tour was brilliant and the Yeoman Wardens are so friendly, knowledgeable and witty.  They can certainly keep you entertained with their interesting stories.We learned that the Duke of Wellington was Constable of the Tower of London from 1826-1852 and in 1832; he moved the troublesome wild animals out of the Tower of London to Regents Park to join the others in the newly formed Zoological Society of London.  I never knew they kept wild animals in the Tower of London!This attraction is a ‘must see’ when visiting London."
"June 24, 2006","Tower of London- pretty much required, but....","The Tower of London is fine: you get to see the crown jewels, lots of weapons, some prison cells, a nice view of the Thames.  If you're coming to London for the first time, it is pretty much a required stop on the standard tourist trail.However, I would not be nearly as sanguine if you could only visit during prime visiting hours, i.e. if you have to fight massive crowds of tourists and visiting schoolkids.  Frankly, I'd skip it if I had to wade through the masses.I strongly suggest: buy your ticket in advance (in the underground station at tower hill, or at your hotel).  Tickets are 15 pounds for an adult.  Take the tube and arrive at the Tower Hill station at 9:30.  You'll be in the T of L by 9:40.  Go straight to the Jewels (since that's where the crowds tend to congregate quickly) and enter.  You'll pretty much have the place to yourself, like we did.  Then go to the White Tower and get through that.If you're inclined, go back to the traitors gate (near the entrance) and hook up with a tour led by the Yeoman Warders.  If you like to go at your own pace, skip the YW tour, spend 3 pounds, and take yourself on a self-guided audio tour.We spent about two hours total.  I guess you might be able to stretch it into 3 if you want, especially if you buy lunch but by then the crowds will be unpleasantly enormous."
"June 21, 2006",Want to walk around bored out of your mind? Visit the Tower of London,"Despite the many glowing reviews, we were disappointed with the Tower of London. It is not that big or interesting, and how many old weapons do you really want to see? It is so touristy that it has a Disney world feel.  I did not feel close to history at all.The crown jewels did not interest me; I doubt they would be of interest to most men. Women might enjoy seeing them. I found them gaudy and garish and not worth the wait.Here's a tip: if you must go, go later in the afternoon.  It's still crowded, but not nearly as busy as earlier in the day. Avoid the overpriced gift shops selling items made outside of England. I would never go here again nor would I take first timers to London here. Point it out from a distance; save your money."
"October 29, 2005",Lots of History,"We really enjoyed the Tower of London.  Wait for the free guided tour by the beefeaters, even if it means you are part of a big crowd.  They are entertaining and point out things to look for inside.  The jewels were fabulous, though clearly there can sometimes be a long wait for them, and I don't know if they would have been fabulous if I had had to wait through all the queues they had.  We were pretty much able to walk right to them and stay as long as we liked.  They were pretty unbelievable.  Outside of that, there were lots of rooms to explore and displays to see, a lot of history to be had.  An overall very interesting experience."
"June 24, 2005",The Tower in 2 hours,"The Tower is a must see for anyone who has interest in English History.  That being said, I strongly recommend reading up a little on your English History before touring the Tower.  This will provide you a much greater appreciation of what you are viewing.  There is a lot here to behold, take your time and begin your tour in the early morning, if possible. When my family recently toured here, we had already had a long day of touring Westminster and Whitehall, so our feet were tired and, after having seen the glory of the previous 2 sites, we were left a little unimpressed by these older, less ornate buildings."
"September 16, 2019",Steeped in History,"My wife and I visited the Tower of London recently and were extremely pleased we did so. We spent the best part of six hours walking around a fascinating piece of history. The Yeomen of the guard conduct amazing tours that both educate and entertain, and are more than happy to have their photo taken with you. The spectacular buildings with the walls are a testament to the genius of the builders of the past."
"October 2, 2018",Sad to see it comply with the present day.,"The last time I visited the Tower of London It was probably twenty plus years ago and it was such an interesting place. I visited it again a few weeks ago and was so shocked by what I saw. Gift shops all over the place with coffee shops and kitschy looking people walking around in period costumes. I have to say that all the atmosphere has all gone behind sterile half inch thick glass and audio things dished out to tourists. The one place I remember was the building housing all the armour and arms. Its now got a monstrous dragon made out of guns, armour, and swords to greet you! It now reminds me of Ikea. Once you enter a single tower you have to just follow a stream of tourists going at one speed and one way only until you have completed part way to yet another gift shop or gift shop! I bought a season ticket and decided to probably go mid winter when it's less busy. The stream of people for the crown jewels was like a snake that never ended in it's twists and turns until about two hours later you would make it to the door!Unfortunately this wonderful place of our heritage has fallen foul of the tourist trap. Even at the top of one of the most famous parts of the tower was subjected to interactive games for children! sadly I couldn't wait to find an exit. Very sad. "
"January 25, 2006",My favorite place in London!!,"This was my 2nd visit to both London and the Tower.I started with a brief look at the Crown Jewels 1st thing in the morning.  Then I took the Yeoman Warders tour.  This is an excellant starting point for history of the Tower.  Also, ont he tour you get to go into St Peter's Chapel, which is closed to everyone else.I could have spent all day here and still not see everything.  I took 3 rolls of film this trip.One night I attended the Ceremony of the Keys.  It was quite eerie to be in the Tower at night. I felt like I was all alone - a little spooky.  The Ceremony has been happening nightly for over 700 years, so i really felt like a part of history.  It is nice to see the traditions continue.  The Ceremony lasts for 7 minutes, but you get a history lesson first.  You also need to write to the Tower in advance for tickets becasue the number of attendees is limited each night.I felt that the Tower is a must do place to visit! I will visit again on my next trip too."
"January 4, 2005",Great..a must see in London!,Don't pass up the Tower of London when visiting the UK.  A guided tour led by one of the Beefeaters is a MUST!!  They do an outstanding job and really bring the place alive.
"July 23, 2019",A Must See in London,"Allow at least 3 to 4 hours to properly explore the various towers and learn more about the rich history behind them. It can get very busy, especially on weekends, so try to get a ticket online. I booked through Klook and got an eticket which had to be redeemed at the group tours window before entering. Bear in mind that there is a queue at this window (although it's shorter than the ticket queues), and you will have to wait in another queue for the security check afterwards, before entering the tower. It's advisable to join a Beefeater tour, which is free and starts from 10am every half an hour. The Beefeaters are all very knowledgeable and have the craziest stories to share. Rather wait for the later tours as the first one is always packed. It's also a good idea to view the Crown Jewels exhibition first, as the queue gets ridiculously long during the day, and you really only get about a 20 second viewing period on a platform that moves past the jewels on display."
"June 13, 2019",Missed the Jewels,"Great historical site but there are queues for every attraction and the one for the Crown Jewels went on for miles! Despite booking tickets you still have to join what seems is an unending journey just to get to the entrance, then it's queuing again and waiting which takes away what the attraction is meant to offer. What was really disappointing was that even though there were so many visitors, the venue continued to sell tickets which made it impossible to get to see what we really went there for because the queues were just too daunting and having stood for 45mins we decided to let the jewels lie!"
"January 21, 2019",Tower of London,"The key is to get to the Tower of London EARLY!  We arrived when it opened & had no line to see the Crown Jewels.  By the time we exited, there was quite a queue!  We used Chase Rewards for the admission ticket."
"January 3, 2019",Great visit and (oddly) great food,We went to the Tower of London October 2004.  The Beefeater's Tour was great.  We spent a full day there.  The lunch we had was the best meal in 2 weeks touring the UK (and we ate at a lot of pretty expensive places!)  Try the icebox cake!
"November 5, 2004","This is a 1-star review of TripAdvisor’s advance tickets, NOT the Tower tour. The Tower of London is a Great attraction worth your visit. HOWEVER, if you get advance tickets, be advised ... the information printed on your ticket voucher is misleading and INCORRECT. To exchange your voucher for tickets, simply go to the Tower ticket windows, Group Tickets. It’s easy! But the voucher gives you a redemption address that Goggle Maps nor 6-8 locals could locate. What a waste of 45 minutes and a lot of worthless walking!  TripAdvisor ... get your info worthwhile!",One of the amazing ancient heritage sites
"September 11, 2019","One of the magnificent towers of London, this tower is one of the ancient heritage sites. At the same time, tourists come from distant places to see the beauty of the Tower Bridge built on the river Thames. Standing above the bridge, watching the city of London is just another fun.",Must visit..Kohinoor diamond
"June 7, 2019",A must visit tourist place..stone throw away distance from Tower Bridge..It house the Kohinoor Diamond from India and another 510 carat diamond from Africa..you can see the black and red colour dressed security..has a moving platform to keep people moving inside the Tower..,Don't miss it!
"December 17, 2015","We took the advice of other posters and arrived just after the doors opened at 9. We had purchased our tickets the day before from a shop near the London Eye.  There are many places in town that sell them, not just tube stations.  Again, following advice from other posters, we saw the Jewels first.  They were beautiful, but the best part came after we'd seen them.  We sat down on a bench just outside the exit from the Jewels, and watched a Yeoman Warder approach a family with a young boy, aged about 4 years old I'd say.  They were asked if the little boy would like to go back in and try on a real crown - no pictures allowed.  When they came back out, the little guy appeared to have been transformed by the experience. It was hilarious and adorable.  Then we took a Yeoman Warder tour, and ours was excellent.  They vary tremendously in what they say and how they say it, so if you don't find one appealing, wander around a bit until the next one gets started.  I was thrilled to walk on the old wall and  mused on what it must have been like for one of my ancestors who was confined there for nearly 2 years during the 1600's.  When the crowds increased, we decided to move on to the Museum of London, a short bus ride away.  Someday we'll go back to  the Tower and see some of the things we missed on the first trip.  Having lasted a thousand years, it's likely to be there a year or two more!",Tower of London
"July 9, 2006","Amazing fortress full of history. Prepare to spend at least half a day, so much to see. Very well organized, there were lots of tourists but everything went smoothly. If you are interested in history of Britain, this is a place for you. ",Tower of London - wear athletic shoes!
"September 28, 2004","Every traveller knows to wear comfortable shoes, but, when visiting the Tower of London, wear athletic shoes, or the thickest, most cushioned pair of shoes you own.  The pavement of the Tower ranges from asphalt to cobblestone, all unforgiving and rife with potential ankle-twisters.  In addition, be prepared to do a substantial amount of going up and down steps.  I wore a pair of rubber-soled SAS loafers, normally very comfortable, but after two hours, I was in serious discomfort.  By the time we left, I was sure I would be crippled!  So, wear those thick-soled sneakers with pride and comfort and enjoy every step.",A must see
"January 21, 2006","If you have one day in London you must see the Tower of London and Westminster Abbey.The Tower is stepped in history.  A fragment of Roman ruins, the White Tower, the various captives - Elizabeth I, Saints Moore and Fisher, Walter Raliegh, the Princes in the Tower, Kings and nobles of Wales, Scotland and France, the chopping block, the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula and St John the Evangelist (this is in the White Tower), the Crown Jewels, the Fusiliers Museum, the Guards (check out the Ceremony of the Keys), theRavens and of course the Yeomen of the Guards and their entertaining tours.  I rather liked the mock up of how they think the Medieval Palace would be during the reign of Edward I.  Easily a 1/2 day if not the whole day.",Extremely Disappointed
"March 20, 2019","I had scheduled this tour 3 months in advance. 2 months before our actual tour, we had a change in our schedule that prevented us from taking this your, so I tried to reschedule to a different day. I know it says no refunds, no schedule changes, but I would have thought that given 2 months to make a change, they would accommodate this request to lets us RESCHEDULE to a different day. Instead they refused !!! Only saying there would be no refund, no ability to even communicate with anyone but the person on the phone. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I WILL NEVER BOOK with VIATOR AGAIN.",Amazing to see 
"January 18, 2019","Really interesting, great couple hrs and a good history lesson. The jewels are amazing. It was a walk from start tonfi ishikawa but nothing heavy",Take a tour with the beefeaters!
"May 8, 2008","The Tower of London was a fun stop on our trip. Take a free, guided tour with one of the Beefeaters - the crowds are pretty big in the afternoon, so try to go in the morning on if you can. Our guide was hilarious and informative.",Worth the visit
"October 7, 2006","A definite must see if visiting London to enhance the London feel.  The history here is what makes it great - even if it is a little pricey:  15 GBP/adult, 12 GBP/senior.  We took the advice of other posters and got there at the opening.  Since we purchased our ticket in advance from the Big Bus Tour people (located at all Big Bus Tour stops), we did not have to buy it at the Tower (although at the time we arrived - Friday at 9am, there were no line ups anyway).  You can buy tickets in advance at your hotel concierge, or any info booth at the train stations as well as at the Tower.   You can also buy them online if you prefer.  Anyway, once you get there, go immediately to the Jewels and get that out of the way.  There were only 2 other people in the room (and 2 Tower employees) when we got there and therefore we made a couple of trips around the room (there is an automated walkway that takes you along the jewels, but when you get off, you can just walk back to the beginning and do it again.  We had to ask where the Koh-i-noor diamond was - as we were looking at the top of the crown, not on the front of it - so keep your eyes open or ask questions.  After we did the Jewel Tower, we went back to the entrance gate and picked up a Warder tour - a definite must do as you'll get much more out of the visit.  They have quite a dry sense of humor and oh - don't forget to ask them first if you can have your picture taken with them, as I saw one poor woman harrassed by the Warder when she just stood beside him to have her picture taken!!!  They are very agreeable if you ask.  After the Warder tour, you may want to walk through the White Tower and have your own look around.  To get the most out of your day, you may want to also include a trip up to Tower Bridge 5.5 GBP/adjust, 4.5 GBP/senior (a must do for the views alone), and you could stop for a pub lunch or a pint at the Dicken's Inn on St. Katherine's Docks.  Oh - be prepared to pay anywhere from 2 GBP to 3.3 GBP for a pint (it seems to vary all over London).  If you look at the US dollar as equivalent to the British Pound you won't flinch too much at the prices.  Everything is about double what it is here!!!  Sorry I'm getting long winded on this post, but if you have ventured to the Tower, and you want to get a ride on an original Routemaster bus (the type you get on from the back), you can do so at Tower Hill bus stop in front of the tower, and take it back to Trafalgar Square - bus #15.  The Routemaster will be gone for good in 2010 since it is not handicap accessible.  The busroute is known as the Heritage route.  There are 2 routes left with these buses #9 and #15.  The #15 Heritage route goes from Trafalgar Square to Tower Hill (both directions).  If you are there for a week - get a 7 day TravelCard which includes tubes/buses and gives you a discount on Thames River cruises.",Tower of London great!
"April 28, 2006","My family visited over Christmas 2003 and it was our first time to London except for my dad.  I thought this place was the most interesting thing we saw in that city.  I am not a history buff by any means but this really captivated me.  The place was awsome, and when you are aware of the history of the Tower, it makes it sooooo interesting.  My favorite places were the crown jewels and the display where the battle armor was.  Even the horse's armor was on display and that was very amazing.  We did not take a tour, just strolled around on our own.  I would recommend a tour and next year when I go again, I would go and do one of the Beefeeter escorted tours.  The waiting in line was rough.  It was super cold that day and their computers broke down.  We probably waited 2hrs in line to get in.  Next time I will by tickets prior so there is no wait.  You just jump the line and go on in.  We didn't know that then, but it really is a time saver!  You can buy tickets on line and my friend told me about ----.  Check it out.",Get there early!
"February 19, 2006","It is quite a few years since I last visited the Tower of London and I must say it has changed a lot - only for the better!  The Jewel House is extremely well-laid-out and all the displays in the White Tower are well organised and signed.  Staff were very friendly and willing to explain and answer our questions.The new restaurant does good food at reasonable prices too !I would certainly say you havent visited London if you havent been to the Tower, but get there early to avoid the coach parties and the queues. Its worth every penny!!",pros/cons/advices: great place!!  A must visit!!
"October 10, 2023","PROS*  Amazing iconic mesmerizing and riveting British history*  A totally classically British place*  Tremendous architecture almost 1000 years old and intact for visiting and exploring*  Be enthralled by entertaining and informative free tours by yeoman warders (Beefeaters) in full traditional regalia*  See the Crown Jewels of the British monarchy*  See massive exhibits and museums about and of historical dress, lifestyles and uniforms of (medieval) warfare*  See informal staged performances of historical events- in full costume of the time period*  Walk along the ancient ramparts*  Explore the moat that surrounds the wall and is massive and long and is no being cultivated with colorful flowersCONS*  The cost- it is at least 28 euros*  The crowds- this is a very very popular (maybe #1) attraction""I VISITED THIS PLACE""...... as part of my goal to see and visit every tourist spot in London, and as stated, this could very well be the #1 attraction.I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here, and I was so glad that I visited.Even though the conventional wisdom is to rush and see the Crown Jewels first, I was drawn, attracted and immediately mesmerized by a yeoman warder tour at the entrance, so I did that first.  Then, I even joined another one- it was so so much fun and educational and informative.  I loved being where so many historical events had been.The line for the Crown Jewels after 10am was not long and moved quickly.  There are many rooms and many historical displays of the crowns and jewels of historical British monarchy, going back many hundreds of years.  Finally- finally, one comes to the end- the crown and cape worn by King Charles III at his recent coronation that very month.I viewed an impromptu staged animated active recreation of historical events from several hundred years ago that took place exactly where we were standing.  It was tremendous and entertaining and funny- see my numerous attached photos of the actors!!I also toured the White Tower and the Salt Tower- the exhibits of incredibly massive amounts of medieval knights' armor and regalia were stunning, along with the metal covers of the horses.  I descended at least four flights from one of the turrets- I tried to video and take photos- it was dizzying.I then walked along the turrets and ramparts and observed and photographed modern London.In summary- a fantastic visit and almost a full day affair.WAS IT WORTH THE PRICE?it is expensive, but it was worth it and I don't regret paying  the (reduced senior citizen) cost.WOULD I VISIT THIS PLACE AGAIN?Sure, but not for 26+ GBPADVICES*  For sure you must go- buy tickets on line and get there early when it opens*  Be sure to go on (at least one) yeoman warder tour*  See the Crown Jewels display as early as you can*  Visit the White Tower and salt Tower and see the stunning exhibits*  Walk along the ramparts",Highlight is free Beefeater tour
"September 10, 2019","I would like to share my tips in order to have a great experience:1. Buy your tickets online in advance and print them at home2. Come early (at opening hours; 9 or 10 am)3. First go to see the jeweles4. Go back to the entrance and take free Beefeater tour (which is absolutely excellent)5. Wander around (visit white tower, etc.)This expirience lasts for about 3 hours",Could have been Better
"June 26, 2019","A few things about this tour.  First, I was lead to believe that purchasing tickets through this site was going to get us ""Priority Entrance"" AND the ""Crown Jewels"" entrance.  There is no such perk as ""priority entrance"" as explained to us by the ticketing counter at the castle.  The entrance into the facility automatically comes with access to the ""crown jewels"", this is not a separate charge.  You are not getting a bundled package here, just a plan admittance ticket.  You still have to wait in a line to get a facility ticket, the printed paper copy is not good as the admittance ticket.  Besides the disinformation by this TripAdvisor offering, going to the facility was really crowded and felt like we were at a Disneyland attraction. They have turned this space into a bit of a theater act.  Advise, just for the pure purpose of seeing such a historic location, go towards the end of the day.  The crowds will be diminishing and you don't have to wait hours on end to walk the crown jewel exhibition.",More to see than we thought
"July 16, 2018","We visited the Tower of London and really enjoyed our visit. There was so much more to see than we thought, the artifacts and jewels were mind blowing. Grab a toru guide because it makes the difference.",Fascinating 
"December 30, 2016","Hadn't been to the Tower since I was kid many moons ago so took the opportunity. Booked tickets on-line for collection immediately, which attracted a discount on purchasing from the ticket office.You can spend ages looking around the different towers and learning about the history of the site including the Crown Jewels which are magnificent.I could spend ages describing this attraction, it wouldn't do it justice. Suffice to say, the best way I can put it is go and see for yourself, you will not be disappointed.",Very unfriendly response to children needs
"July 31, 2015","The Tower is an amazing place to visit and this time I brought .my daughter and grandchildren down from Yorkshire to have a great day. Readers will probably imagine we are very permissive parents and grandparents complaining, but that is not the case. Having brought 4 children aged between 6 and 14 as well as a 10month old baby....spending over £100 entrance plus ice creams etc.etc. we suddenly heard the Yeoman announce it was 5.30 and it was closing time. We immediately moved to exit and asked if we could take the children to the toilet as we left. The reaction of the Yeoman could not have been any different if I had asked him to allow me to leave with the Crown Jewels. I do not exaggerate. After turning a corner we asked a female Yeoman the same question and had a similar if less aggressive response. Why? It was so unnecessary. So uncaring. Such poor service. A very poor example of English service and hospitality. The whole impression suggested an arrogance that should have embarrassed the guilty staff. Earlier we had all visited the London Eye. I can't believe I'm saying this, but the staff and service was of a much higher standard for families than at the Tower. As I left the Tower, I politely asked how I could register a complaint. I was directed to the visitor centre. We were passing anyway (trying to find a toilet) so I called in. Send an email was the response!. I thought I would tell Trip Advisor users, instead.",The best London Landmark
"April 10, 2013","Allpy for tickets for the ceremony of the keys, its free at around 9pm ever night for the lock up a 10 sharp, I think you have to write in or look up 'ceremony of the keys' on line.",The Tower of London
"January 28, 2010","Walking through the Tower/buildings was like walking back into time. The wind whipping through the breezeway and the chill in the rooms added to the atmosphere of being thrown back into time. After having read so much about the tower, it was such an unreal experience to actually walk the grounds, touch the walls, peep out of the windows, and imagine what it must have been like to live there, to rule from there, to be imprisoned there, to defend the place or know that it was your last stop, your gaze out upon the river the last sight you'd ever behold!Many people view the tower as a prison, forgetting it was also a palace and a residence, a fortress, a treasury, a mint, and much more! During my visit there was an exhibit ""Henry VIII: Dressed to Kill"" , a display of weapons and armor that was truly amazing! The Crown Jewels are absolutely spectacular, and luckily it took mere minutes for us to get to them, as the crowd was very small.  There are plenty of exhibits, plaques and such, little touches here and there to give one a quick note of history.Maps are provided and it's wise to allow 2-3 hours to see everything. You'll want to linger and not rush through, paying attention to the smallest of details. If you're in the mood, you can stroll along the river after you tour the tower.There are gift shops offering typical souvenir fare as well as some truly unique gifts.To enrich  your tour, guidebooks and audio guides are available.Restroom facilities are conveniently located on the grounds and cafes and coffee shops are convenient as well.Get there early to beat the crowds! Being there even during low tourist season got a bit claustrophobic at times when walking some of the narrow staircases or trying to view exhibits at leisure. Even with the gathering crowds it was still a great experience, allowing me to put more of a face to history.Tips: Wear comfortable shoes; dress weather appropriate and take into account that you will be near water where it tends to be coolerA personal tip -- Really pay attention to what you see!  The fun is in the details, so enjoy your time and try not to rush through it like some tourist attraction in a long line of things one must do. You're visiting a part of history! Really take it in and have loads of fun.  :=)Enjoy!",Highlight of our London experience
"January 8, 2008","We loved The Tower of London. What made it great was the tour given by a Yeoman Warder (Beefeater). I can't believe we almost skipped this and did the audio tour instead. The Beefeater who gave us the tour was marvelous. He was a real character- just hilarious. And I'm not one who laughs at everything. I'm a pretty tough customer in this regard (my idea of hell would be having to watch the insipid and totally predictable humor of Friends for back to back episodes, to give you an idea). During this tour I laughed so hard my eyes teared up. The guide poked a lot of fun at Americans.  Australians and Germans, among others, got teased too- so no one was spared.We had tea in the restaurant and it was the best tea of our trip to Britain, incredibly. The pastries were heavenly. The scones and cream were yummy. Better and cheaper than tea at The Orangery at Kensington Palace, that all the guide books recommend. Although the orange cake at KP was matchless. I would love to get my hands on the recipe. The restaurant was crowded but the tables were kept cleaned and we found a table with no problem. The best advice I could give you would be to save your money by skipping the audio guide. The information given is practically the  same as the information provided for free at the various plaques posted about the place.Warning: The ticket lines are pretty long and it gets quite hectic. Sadly, a Japanese man tried to cut in line. It was so blatant that at first I thought he must be joining the party in front of us. After a couple of minutes it became obvious that he was on his own. When I asked him if he was with the party in front of us, he immediately stepped behind us without responding. He knew he had been called out. Then I heard the people behind us exclaim in British accents ""Hey, where'd he come from?"" The guy played dumb and,being in a foreign country, we didn't want to make a scene or we would have responded that the guy had tried to jump queue and should be asked to step to the BACK of the line. So be aware of your surroundings and make a note of who is in front of you when you first enter the queue. The lines are very long and you might have some unscrupulous characters who will be tempted to cheat.",Taken by the Tower
"August 19, 2004","Just returned from 8 days in London - 2 adults and 2 teenagers on what might be the ""last family vacation.""  Everyone loved the Tower, in part because we waited for an escorted tour with a Beefeater. He was marvelous. If not trained in the theater, I would be surprised, because his presence was extraordinary. The crown jewels are great to see - but take the time to hear the history from these men who make it come alive. 5 stars.",Get there early to avoid the summer crowds!
"August 24, 2007","Got advance tickets from our concierge and got there about 10:30 a.m. on the tube.Had heard we should see the jewels first, before the crowds arrived, so we hustled over there.  We all loved seeing them, and there were very few people, so we were able to keep circling back and spending as much time as we liked to really enjoy the experience.  Even the teenage boys thought it was tremendous.  A highlight of our trip.Then the crowds began to get large, even though it was a rainy day.Tried to get on the recommended beefeater tours, but didn't think we could manage or hear in the crowd of over 100 people.Watched the actors simulating a medieval scene and fighting (fair).Toured the bloody tower (OK) and the torture exhibit (fair, but quick).Tried to enjoy the White tower with the exhibits of weapons but by then the crowds were overwhelming.  We felt liike we were salmon swimming upstream to spawn, and got out as soon as possible.Lunch was excellent.Recommendations:1) Arrive early, as soon as it opens.2) Take the first early beefeater tour3) See the jewels4) Then White tower5) Then do as you like",Passing along a tip
"February 27, 2007","Some fellow travellers offered us this tip over breakfast at our hotel. Get to the Tower early and make a beeline for the jewel room. They said it fills up after 10 or so, and they weren't kidding. We did just what they suggested, head for the farthest corner of the Tower immediately after entry, and skip the video presentations. At 10:15 AM, there were all of 4 of us riding the conveyors back and forth past the crown jewels. We could take our time. Then we went back to see the rest of the tower, which was overrun with schoolchildren on field trips by then.",See the Beefeaters at the Tower of London
"October 13, 2004","A London attraction you can't miss.This historic site is well worth spending a half day site-seeing. The Beefeaters make the one and a half hour introduction tour so interesting that the time is up before you know it. These purveyors of entertainment make the history of the Tower a joy to learn. Too bad we couldn't of learned history like this in high school. The Crown Jewels and other artifacts were sensational. The armory is impressive in its content of armour, swords, guns and other early period armaments.All in all, I highly recommend taking in the Tower of London.",Have to visit
"February 3, 2004","The Tower of London is rightly known as one of the must see sights of London. I have been there a few times, most recently in March 2003. It is a good idea to get to the Tower as early as possible (not sure what time it actually opens though) and head straight for the Jewel House. It is quiet at this time of day and gives you an oppurtunity to get in and see the Crown Jewels without a crowd around you 'oohing' and 'aahing' After that you can set your own pace and explore the walls and the various buildings. I have never joined one of the Beefeater tours as I have a great love of history and therefore know a lot about events and people who inhabited the Tower. However the tour is the only way you can get into the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula and having never managed to do that before I tagged on to a tour just before they got to the chapel and was able to get inside. The restaurant inside the Tower is quite good but I did see all the school parties tucking into their packed lunches so that is also an option. Bottom line - it's expensive but well worth the visit.",Top historic spot in London
"March 1, 2003","I missed the Tower on my first visit to London, and made it my first stop this time round. It's a wonderful experience, especially given the fact that the admission fee includes a fabulous guided tour with a Beefeater. You can skip the tour and walk around on your own, but I highly recommend it. Each fellow has his own style; our tour was with Mick, a very theatrical and funny man who brought the scenes to life (and recited a stirring passage from Shakespeare's ""Richard III""). The crown jewels are here, as well as armor and various other displays. I was less interested in that stuff than the awe-inspiring surroundings of this town within a town. Not to mention the resident ravens. History really comes to life here.",Amazing & Stunning
"November 23, 2019",My first visit to this part of London especially to check out the Tower of London & Tower Bridge.Both are breathtaking beautiful and a great part of history.,Beefy 409
"October 19, 2019","Visited the Tower of London a number of times but this was the first time we chose to do the warden tour! We were taken around by beefeater Scott Kelly, he clearly loves his job and his interaction with the crowd was brilliant. If you visit please wait for one of the tours, every 30 minutes I think, and if your lucky you’ll get Scott Kelly, beefy #409! ",Not Quite What Advertised
"June 22, 2019","The ""skip the line"" concept was misleading. You don't have to stand in line to purchase tickets but you still have to stand in the group ticket line to redeem your voucher for actual entry tickets. The group ticket line doesn't open until the same time as the tower so you then have to take your entry tickets and get in line to actually enter the Tower. This was the extremely long line and we didn't get to skip it. If we had known this I would have had a member of our party get in the group line while the rest of us waited in the long line for entry. The good news was the Tower staff moves things along quickly and we weren't delayed to much. The tower itself was great but very crowded.  The Yeomans were very informative and we really enjoyed it.",A MUST if you visit London
"October 20, 2018","We had a week to visit London's many historic attractions [I am a historian] and two places stand out: the Tower of London and the British Museum.  If you can - save a day for each !  The tower's various sections are truly a delight and show you what life was like without electricity and modern plumbing.    The displays of armor and weaponry are awesome, as are the Crown Jewels.   Leave time to walk and see the surrounding grounds, including the canons, outdoor stage under the huge tree, the crows [smart birds !], and the masonry.  ",Very poor customer service
"March 30, 2018",Whilst appreciating the actual venue and it's historical importance we found the overall experience very disappointing due to the rude staff. They all seemed completely disinterested and absolutely no idea of customer service. Poor service on every level - would not recommend because of that - spoiled the whole visit. ,Great place to visit
"October 24, 2007","In my opinion, one of the best places in London to visit. The outside is photo-worthy with areas to sit and just relax if you want. The inside is broken up into a couple of different areas that you can go to. There are tours that you can take (free) on set intervals starting from the bridge at the entrance and they last for maybe 45 minutes. The tour is ok, but it skips over some of the larger buildings such as the White Tower. There is a lot of walking and a lot of stairs, so be prepared.If you wanted to look at everything it could probably last 3-4 hours so budget accordingly. Saying that, a fair bit of it is old weapons and war related material that you may not be too interested in. However, the guys can look at the guns and the girls can look at the crown jewels, win/win situation! You can also take pictures here, unlike many other London places where they prohibit it.If you want to avoid the line-ups remember that you can buy tickets in advance on line.",Over priced and not informative
"May 31, 2007","I visited the Tower on Bank Holiday with my partner and a friend.  We paid £16 each and seemed to get very little for this.  There was very little information anywhere because they want you to pay even more for a guide book or audio tour.  You can join a tour if you have time but there were huge crowds for this and long queues for the Bloody Tower.  We were conveyor belted past a series of crowns with just the name next to them '1937 Imperial State Crown' but no other information.  The same was true of St.Pauls, Westminster Abbey and other sights.  They are all such amazing buildings which are part of all of our heritage and yet they seem to be run purely as a money making enterprise.  I cannot see how a family can spend an entire day here ( I am a History teacher and 2 hours was enough for me) yet the high price is justified because it is a 'day out'.",A Must See in London!!
"December 12, 2006","I love the Tower. There's just so much to see! A lot of history and you can tell/feel that in there with all the Kings' heads, traitor's gate and all that. Admission is £15 and it's all worth it. Don't forget to take the Beafeater tour (included in the admission).",It was a lot more interesting than I expected
"June 27, 2006","...especially since i really hate museums, galleries and the like. I decided to visit the tower of london after reading some good reviews on this site - and i'm glad i did. it was very interesting. it can easily take up a whole day. too bad i only had a short time to spend there so i missed a lot of narrated stories by the beefeaters, I would definitely reccomend for you to go there if you have never been.",Great Tour!
"September 27, 2023","We really enjoyed this tour!   The Tower is large, so plan on spending a few hours here.   It took us about 4 hours total.  We opted for the Beefeater tour first followed by the self guided audio tour.  It would have taken longer had we read everything there was to read, as there was so much information to take in!  The Beefeater was funny and entertaining with his stories.   We did have a hard time hearing him a few times as we weren’t close enough but I would still recommend doing that part of the tour prior to the rest of the Tower.   I was surprised they charged an additional fee for the headsets/audio tour but it was helpful.  Highly recommend!",Beware of booking on TripAdvisor
"December 28, 2019","I give this a terrible rating due to my experience with Tripadvisor.  TA sold me tickets for Tower of London for Christmas Eve 2019. I was told that it was opened on x-mas eve when I booked it the month+ before.  Lo and behold, when I got there with my family, THE EXHIBIT WAS CLOSED!. I am disappointed with TA and I am feeling crossed. I expect them to have known this exhibit would be closed on x-mas eve since they were the ticketing agent, and at the very least told me before my trip so I could I would have made other plans.  But instead, I had to find out that it was closed as I was reading the sign in front of the Tower regarding the x-mas eve closure.  I would have loved to review this exhibit if I was able to see it. Thanks TA for the screw up.  I will try to get a refund and make another report on the experience.  TA will probably not post this review.",RIP off expensive

"October 1, 2015",See the Queens crown Jewels and all the collections of jewelry belonging to her and the family. Worth the visit.,"Poorly Managed, Will At Least Partially Disappoint Most"
"March 19, 2015","There is no question that this is an iconic attraction in London, and if you have dreamed all your life of seeing it, then you should.But, so that your expectations are tempered:1. Very expensive - 25 pounds for an adult. Much farther walk from the Tube than it looks. Much colder and windier than most of London.2. At all times of year, the crowds and queues are horrendous.3. The Yeoman Warder Tour is not worth joining. It consists of a stand-up comic in costume, making cheap jokes about a variety of subjects, including ridiculing members of his audience. It is a total waste of one hour's time. Instead, go out on your own.4. The grounds consist of many essentially separate structures, and it is very hard to decide where to go. Aside from the Two Murdered Princes, all you will get (history-wise) from any of them is obscure facts and anecdotes about people you never heard of. William the Conqueror built the Tower around 1066-1090 AD after winning the Battle of Hastings, and since then, almost nothing of interest has happened here, except for the incarceration of enemies of assorted monarchs. The management should set up a Suggested Short Tour with numbered stops, and an In-Depth Historical Fanatic Tour, also numbered. Instead they leave you to your own devices.5. If you are interested in seeing the Crown Jewels, know that everyone else is, too. Though of course you have to see them now that you've paid this much to get in, you will get a number of videos first, then about one minute on a moving conveyor sweeping you by lots of crowns. You have about 5 seconds per crown. If you want to see the Kohinoor Diamond, take the closer conveyor, and it will be visible on the last crown. Washington's Smithsonian has a display of famous jewels, too, and it seems to me I got to take my time there.6. If in a group of more than 3, you might as well each go your own way, and agree exactly where and when you will meet up later. Otherwise you will just waste each other's time waiting for one of you to finish a structure.Whoever is in charge of the Tower, they need to bring in some theme-park and crowd-management expertise, so they can deliver more value to different kinds of visitor.",Give This 'Monument' A Miss
"November 4, 2014","I'd like to give this No Stars but I have to give it one to get the review published.  What a waste of £22.  The last time I visited the Tower of London, at the beginning of the 90s it was a really good experience.  We thoroughly enjoyed a guided visit with the Yeoman of the Guard, who gave us little tit bit stories at each stop; near a locked gate, a brick wall, the moat.  He managed to bring the whole visit alive.  However, this time, 8th October 2014, what a waste of time and money.  For a start, on queuing up for your expensive ticket you have to listen to the poor cashier having to repeat the same sentence again and again with, obviously, no interest in our answer 'would you like a guide with that', over a microphone so that we can hear it for the next 15 minutes.  I felt sorry for her first and then us as our experience started to tumble to a drone like feeling.  We got in to the Tower and waited at the appropriate place for the Yeoman to take us on the tour, an hour as is promised on the internet.  He arrived and due to the rain (hardly any, and he was wearing his shower proof cape anyway) he told us that the talk would be in the chapel and would only be for 30 minutes as due to the bad weather.  Ok.  We all dutifully followed in our drone like state, we arrived at the chapel and he addressed us with the news that the talk would now be for 25 minutes.  mmmmmmm!  We all piled in to the chapel and he then told us that he would speak for 20 minutes.  Whilst telling us the piddly stories of dead people under the chapel he continually looked at his watch.  Really uninteresting and a total swindle on the part of the Tower of London.  We then went to see the Crown Jewels.  What a larf!  We were led down dark corridors with lots of pictures of coronations projected on to the walls and trumpety music wafting all around us.  After a long time of shuffling along we finally got into the room with the Crown Jewels.  Unbelievably we were now transported on the moving floor so that we couldn't linger in front of each crown.  There was no history to read of, just a lot of bling.  You felt that there really is 2 worlds of the haves and have nots and how the haves have absolutely no taste or subtlety.  Unfortunately, whoever is in charge of brining this stage show in to town, went the nationalistic route and just made a mockery of any sort of seriousness as to how were the jewels are put together, who made them, what is the history of the larger jewels, how many people died in the obtaining of them - just simple things to make it a bit more profound.  On leaving you couldn't help but notice the collection box at the side.  We looked around the tacky shops and then didn't bother to look at anything else as we were completely disenchanted.  This building looks great from a distance, you do not have to pay a fortune to go inside as there is nothing of intelligence to see.  The poppies, however, were really interesting and for those that are interested, you don't have to pay to see them.  Give this 'monument' a miss!",Unjustified Money Making
"October 30, 2014","My family and me visited the Tower on 29/10/14 having pre-booked a family ticket. On arrival at about 1130, I thought the excessive queues in Tower Hill tube station were due to visitors for the poppy exhibition but the queues of people waiting to pay for admission to the Tower itself were staggering and although we had pre-booked we joined a queue that took almost 30 mins to get access. As soon as we entered the Tower we realised this was going to be a shambles. Everywhere you looked there were queues. We waited 20 mins for a Beefeater tour (which was very good) but due to the crowd this was condensed into a visit to the chapel. After that we queued for about 40 mins to enter the Torture In The Tower which turned out to be a 1 minute walk through of a tower displaying 3 poor replicas of torture instruments. The bigger torture was the queuing to get there !After that we thought we' d head for the White Tower and didn't appreciate that the crowd that wouldn't embarrass Old Trafford at full time was in fact a queue to get in. As rain was now falling and we were told the estimated wait time for entry was 90 mins we decided to explore the walls only to find that the confined space (understand that) coupled with the congestion meant moving between towers was worse than the M25 on a bad day.We dipped out and thought we'd try the Crown Jewels. You've guessed it ......1 hour minimum queue. By this time the rain was more steady so we thought we'd cut our losses and left. It was now about 1430 and as we left the ticket booths were still selling tickets which brings me to my point.The queue management outside the Tower was appalling, no-one giving directions, people queue jumping but the administrators must have been aware of the unacceptable queues for all the Tower attractions at the time we arrived but were still selling tickets to people who, before the place closed, would just spend their money queuing. An attraction such as this should serve its paying public much better than this. We saw disabled persons and infants in queues stretching right across the paved areas, unsupervised and without any regards for their needs.MONEY GRABBING IN THE NAME OF HISTORY.I'll never return",Remarkable place - fascinating history
"August 21, 2014","We came on August when they displays poppies all over the place as a memory to ww1. They called it ""blood swept lands and seas of red"".  The tower is huge place with lots of things to see. Recommended!",Way more than I expected
"August 15, 2014","This is certainly a place worth your visit. It's a collection of dozens of buildings and towers, each with historical exhibitions inside. We easily spent 3 hours here. Plus, you get great views of Tower Bridge while you're walking around the Wall Walk.Here are my suggestions for a pleasant visit: 1) Purchase tickets online ahead of time and have them mailed to you, so you can skip the entire ticket line and walk right in. There was a small processing fee added to the pre-order, but it was absolutely worth it. 2) Go on a weekday (if possible). 3) Get there right at opening time. I mean, get there 5 minutes before it opens. 4) Walk directly to the Crown Jewels building and visit there first. 5) Then, go to the White Tower and see the floors and floors of exhibitions inside there. 6) After that, do whatever strikes your fancy (Beefeater tour, exploring the other towers, having lunch, walking the wall walk).We did exactly what I suggested above and didn't wait at all, nor were we herded through any of the major buildings. There was a bit of a line (not even 10 minutes) to get through some of the smaller towers, but by this point it was almost noon so there were a lot more people in the complex.","Must-See, But ..."
"January 3, 2014","... Disappointing.  That's the best way I can describe the Tower of London.  This is one of those sites that you must see while visiting London.  It is so much a part of the London experience that if you sidestep this attraction you'll leave feeling you've missed something.  That said, the Tower of London left me feeling disappointed.The Tower is a self-guided experience.  There are numerous and informative placards throughout the buildings and the grounds.  You can linger in areas of interest, and move quickly through areas that fail to hold your attention.The highlghts of the Tower experience are the crown jewels, the torture chamber and the armory.  All are interesting and help tell the story of England's history.My disappointment came from the commercial feel of the Tower grounds.  Clearly there has been a lot of work done to restore the castle, and understandably so.  However, it takes away from the historical feel of the Tower, especially if when compared to other historical sites that remain true to their historical roots.  The experience reminded me of the Renaissance Festival ... Medieval times as seen through the eyes of 21st century reenactors.  It just has a false and commerical feel to it.",London tower with london pass
"November 5, 2013","Just recently visited the london tower using the london pass. The tower itself was ok, and yes worth the visit. The lines for the Crown Jewels was long and ok.. I saw them and were impressive. I happened to be there on a Holiday week for Europeans along with children out of school. Not a good time to tour, but my only window of time for travelling London.Still,London was worth the effort...What a amazing city of sights and attractions to fill ones days of never ending things to see or do. A great city full of never ending energy.My main reason for writing this review is to like others who have suggested is to question the purchasing of the London Pass and London dining Pass. In which I did and afterwards, did not have too...and over paid for attractions now seen after the trip it seems. I could have just paid seperately for each entry and would have paid less! Why? Unless, you are the type of person who can run from one entry to another in their book antractions at least cover 6 attractions within the book within 3 days of their Pass Book...really not worth it! You will also be within an attraction for some length of time, walking, taking pictures, and taking in the free entry attractions as well. The ""British Museum"" which is free and a wonder in itself could be used for one day entirely for it alone! Unbelievable Museum full of world wide artifacts of ancient times! I have been to the Lourve in Paris..and many other museums in Europe...this museum takes second next to the Lourve in my opinion. So? add it all up...costs for the London Pass Card and time for all other attractions...unless you can run! in and out of all the listed wonders...you will see like myself...Pass for two? I overpaid! I used it for 4 attractions only..And? the Dining Card? Forget it! First you have to find the places to eat. When I did find one ...I was told it did not work for this mid week day? Then, when I did eat at a place in the book "" Mela""...Was told I had to order two starters? and then two main dishes...and then?..cost me more to eat there than purchasing dinners on my own! Yes, dinning in London is and can be expensive ...like all of London. I ate at two pubs that had ok food with a great British local feeling atmosphere, and paid less than using the card with its' added rules. "" The Bag of Nails "" near Victoria Underground had a fun atmosphere and good food. Also, "" The Museum Pub"" across from the British Museum was good.I hope that I helped some travellers who are considering the London Pass or Dinning card? If I return to London, I would not purchase either...and would consider other un costly options. Just get a tube pass and go! Lots to see and do in London..Yes, a great city to see in ones Lifetime...but, a costly one also. The British Pound will pound you! but, worth it...smilesTravelling Rig..Usa..CaliforniaPs? Please excuse quick review with non editing...spelling, etc...I hope tripadvisor does? My first time review..On the run here...travelling",Only visit if you truly interested in English history
"April 29, 2012","If you have read my previous reviews, i normally give tips and advice to travellers. Therefore I am going to give you top tips for visiting Tower of London.Tip 1: As per title of my review, only visit this site if you are truly interested in history of Britain. Tip 2: Admission fee is £21.50 (including £1 donation fee) therefore please make sure you tell the cashier whether you want to make the donation or not. We didnt make a donation.Tip 3: Food like hot sandwiches and coffees are quite expensive in the Tower so make sure you eat before you visit the Tower.Tip 4: There is a free tour walk done by the beefeater (not sure if they were?) every 30 minutes and i highly recommend you to take the tour because its very informative. Tip 5: Make sure when you enter the Tower, go straight to the Crown Jewel museum because it always get very busy when the free tour walk finishes.Tip 6: If you want to save a bit of money and grab something cheap to eat, there is a Subway store outside of the Tower.If you think my reviews are awesome and helpful, click 'Yes' for 'Was this review helpful?' Thanks!",BEST attraction in London; a must-see!!!
"February 6, 2007","The Tower of London was at the top of my list of things to see before my January 07 excursion. It did not disappoint. While it may seem pricey, I guarantee that you will find yourself immersed in it's history/culture/drama. If you take the Tube to the Tower, you are hit with it's stark, medieval architecture upon exiting the underground...a menacing view to be sure, but much better than entering through ""Traitor's Gate""as they did centuries ago. Beefeater tours generally begin near the front entrance; you can choose to skip it (the tour is included with the price of admission) but I highly recommend joining as you will be made privvy to factoids of history (as gory as they may be) that you may not hear elsewhere. Such as: Anne Boleyn's lips were still uttering a prayer after her head had been chopped off. After the Beefeater tour, you are free to explore the Tower at your leisure. You can peruse the various towers/chambers, view the armory of Kings, or bask in awe at the Crown Jewels. The latter is the only part of the day that I found to be tedious...perhaps it was because of the pushy tourists or the fact that it just didn't really interest me. Or maybe it was envy. All in all, if you do one thing whilst in London - be sure it is a trip to the Tower.",A gymn visit before you come here
"June 24, 2022",This is a very fit person's tour. The walk and steps that you walk up and down sees that you need a visit to gymn before you come here.,Go early - and other key tips
"December 27, 2019","The Tower of London is an icon with incredible historical value. Tips to make the most of your visit:* Go early. It is a key tourist attraction and the nature of the tower means a lot of the things to see are in narrow winding corners so to avoid excessive queues do this first thing* As soon as you enter, go to the queue for the Crown Jewels. You will be waiting 30 minutes whilst seeing paintings and some artefacts before actually seeing the Crown Jewels. If you don’t go first then you will be potentially waiting 90 minutes. The most important crown, the one used for state occasions is actually at the end after the moving walkway and doesn’t seem to get as much attention.* Next go to the Torture room - this is very small and also tends to get queues. You see a few items only and it isn’t gruesome at all* Definitely get a guidebook, audio guide or download information beforehand to appreciate the true historic nature of the tower. Many people think it was a prison but in reality it was so much more - part safety deposit box, part storage of records, part royal mint, part royal home in times of trouble, and part tourist attraction/zoo as well as a prison. A must visit.",Book direct and save money
"December 16, 2019",The tour offered dosnt give over 60 discount and is more expensive than booking online direct or via ebookers  - Just paid £38.80 for 2 tickets -with free cancellation  some one is making a BIG profit!,Historical site 
"October 30, 2019",We joined the beef eater tour.  It was great to walk where history was orchestrated and being told the stories associated with it.   I also enjoyed visiting the Crown Jewels.  We didn’t get to see it all because it poured rain which dampened our enthusiasm but enjoyed what we did experience,Fascinating historical site
"September 14, 2019",Take the Beefeater tour when you go in.  It's included in your fare and worth the time. Not only are they knowledgeable but they are a part of the history and are assigned there. They aren't the usual tour guides because that isn't actually their job.  Just go and you'll understand. The crown jewels are nice to see and the history behind them as well as all the buildings was fascinating. Well worth the visit,Wear comfortable shoes because your legs are going to be sore!
"September 13, 2019","You’ll be pounding the cobblestone paths for hours at the Tower of London but the inevitable sore legs are a small price to pay.  This place is phenomenal. We arrived at opening time having pre- bought tickets. This allowed us to queue for even less time but in all honesty, there weren’t long lines. Not sure if this is normal for the shoulder season but as per TA advice, we headed straight for the Crown Jewels which didn’t disappoint. No photography allowed in this exhibit but do get the recorded commentary as you hear a lot about it this way. We then joined the second Yeoman Warder tour of the day. I think they go every half hour and the 10am one had too many people on it for my liking - roughly 150 so I opted for the second. Our Yeoman Warder’s name was Clive and even though we had a big group, Clive had a fantastic voice that carried beautifully and we missed nothing. He really brought the venue to life for us and told the best stories. The experience wouldn’t have been near as good without Clive. After this, our sore feet were demanding a rest so we took an early lunch in the cafe. We then tackled some more of the exhibits such as the White Tower. In all, the grounds are beautiful, the history is compelling and I would rate this experience right up there with the top things I’ve done in this European trip. ",must visit for all Indians
"August 25, 2019","I believe that if an Indian wishes to see how much the British exploited Indians and how much money they took from our land to eradicate their hunger and poverty, then the tower of London is the place to be. SEE the diamonds the rubies and all precious items they stole from India to satisfy their impoverished needs.","""Skip the Lines"" - NOT!!!"
"July 31, 2019","Want to pay MORE and then be told to get in line with everyone else who paid less? Then, THIS is the tour for you!What a rip off! I should have just gone up to the ticket window and bought my tickets outright. It would have saved me money, and I still would have had to wait in all the normal lines.",Very beautiful Place
"July 21, 2019","The Tower of London is a must see, but if you come in the touristy season, plan to be there as soon as it opens to avoid massive crowds. We came around 10:20 and the crowds weren’t bad at all, but when we were done the crowds were big. It’s a very beautiful place with lots of history. I’m glad we got to see it.","Go early esp if it’s summer. Kids 10, 13 and 15"
"July 12, 2019","This is a must see. Of all the sites we crammed into our short 2 night stay in London this topped the list.London Tower is not only picturesque (Palace, on the Thames, with prisons, next to Tower Bridge) but fascinating (Jane Grey imprisoned and executed here, you can see her graffiti on the wall) historical (more monarchs lived here in this palace than any other), and the Beefeater experience only adds to it. Crown Jewels at a must do and kids rode the moving walkway twice to get a view of jewels from either side. Go early. Ticket line is short but entry line long. We arrived at 10am first entry with online tix bought, but the entry line already snaked along two sides of the Palace. Line moved quickly and we were in under 30 min. Go immediately to Crown Jewels line skipping beefeater tour and all other sites. The Crown Jewels line only gets longer throughout the day.  Our wait at 10:35 was 5 minutes to get in. When we exited 30 minutes later the line was 10x longer. ",Overcrowded and misleading info 
"July 2, 2019",I came here 25 years ago and it was the highlight of my trip... I was a bit disappointed this go round. I was led to believe this was a fast pass or skip the line which it is not. The beefeater tour had over 100 people swarming the beefeater so it was quite disappointing. The line for the crown jewels was so long we didn’t go because we had already lined up forever to get in to the place. ,Majestic Tower of London - One of the best things to do in London
"June 28, 2019","Tower of London is one of the most recognisable icons of London often shown in the same image as the adjacent Tower Bridge.It offers a magnificent view from across the river Thames, from Tower Bridge and a sense of well preserved history as you get closer even before you explore it from the inside.Wonderful visual treat for visitors and locals.",GREAT!
"June 20, 2019","We went on a weekday around 11 am, and there was no line! Make sure to meet up with a Beefeater (guy/lady in red uniform) to the left of the entrance for a free tour! It was super informative and entertaining! Give yourself a few hours for sure to see all the Tower has to offer, including the ravens. We just watched them for at least 30 minutes. So much history! The Crown Jewels line looked lengthy, but moved very quickly, so don't let the line deter you. These are THE crown jewels, so YES, wait in the line. :) Also, the view of Tower Bridge is great. Even if you only have a short time in London, make SURE to include The Tower of London.","Be sure to use the Yeoman Warder ""Beefeater"" Tour available at no extra cost"
"June 17, 2019","While I generally enjoy taking guided/walking tours, after ten very dry ones in Britain, I was burned out.  Glad I opted to take the “Beefeater Tour"" on my visit to the Tower of London; my final tourist stop.   Yeoman warder, Scott Kelly, the 409th yeoman warder of all time, was our entertaining guide.  The current 37 yeoman warders all live and work in the Tower of London.  It’s a ""massive honor"" to become one. You need to have completed at least 22 years of military service, earned a Good Conduct Medal,  and attained a rank of warrant officer.  Scott's humor kept our attention.  I'm very hard of hearing and although our group was large, I was always able to position myself where I could hear Scott.  It helped he had a voice that carried and was mindful to speak loudly so all could hear.  Good tour.  Fun.",Vacation! 
"June 16, 2019","I have been wanting to see the Tower for ages, and I was not disappointed! Once you are on the grounds, make sure to take the guided tour with the Yeoman Warder.  Our guide was Jim, and he was incredible.  I would strongly recommend giving yourself lots of time, as there is so much to see.  The Crown Jewels and the ravens were my favourite! ",A must for anyone with an interest in English history
"June 15, 2019","While the Tower of London is a must on the list of any person with an interest in English history, and while the site as such is impressing and worth a visit, just as the displays are well made, something is lacking: character. An example: One of the more interesting parts of the history of the Tower is that of the Royal Mint. The exhibit does not reflect that: it is small, and uninspiring, which means it is too small and cursory to satisfy anyone already interested in the topic, and not tempting anyone who isn't already read on the topic to learn more.A recreation of the mint works during, say, sir Isaac Newton's tenure would had been one way to make it better.The same could be said about the White Tower. Displays of armour is all well but a recreation of the interior from one or two of the more interesting periods had better tickled my fantasy.It was worth visiting, but I'm not expecting to return.",definitely worth a day or two visit
"June 12, 2019",never went because thought it was just a tourist trap - which it is - but it's also something that you have to see to believe - you can read about all the history of it but untill you see where it happened you can't really get it.  total wow!,Don’t do it
"June 5, 2019","In the 1980’s, I visited as a pre-teen when I became obsessed with British history and culture, largely based on what I had learned at the Tower.  I visited again in 1999 after college, and once again had a wonderful visit that was so informative and interesting.  This time was 100% pure chaos.  I took my teenaged niece, and intended to join a yeoman tour.  Ugh—the one starting up when we arrived had about 100 people in it!  So, we got the audio guides.  The audio guides are a complete waste of money.  Nothing is marked on the audio guide to match the building, so we never knew what button to push.  We never heard about Henry, etc. other than about his armor.The line to see the Crown Jewels had hundreds of people in it, so we bailed.My niece learned nothing beyond what I, a non-Brit, told her about Henry VIII, his wives, Lady Jane Grey, etc.  She was bored to death.  We wasted an entire London morning and plenty of GBP on this dreadful experience.There were about a million screaming children everywhere running around uncontrolled.  We visited on our last day in London, which also happened to be a bank holiday, and it really threw a pall over what had been an amazing trip up to that point.With so many other incredible places to visit in London, buy a book on British history, and skip the Tower.",April half term break
"June 3, 2019",i loved this place.  we did the official Yeoman tour which was free rather than wander around on our own and i was so glad we did.  it was so informative and the guy leading the tour was hilarious.  we booked our tickets on line prior to the visit which proved to be advantageous as the queues at the ticket office were really long.  we also saved money booking it this way.  my 8 year old really didnt want to do this but as soon as the tour started she enjoyed it.  definitely worth a visit,Scott Kelly Beefeater is awesome
"June 3, 2019","Dramatic presentation, good humor and he brings history to life! Wish the tour was longer. So many beheadings, so many queens wronged. So many outspoken people tortured. ",National embarrassment
"May 30, 2019","Today we experienced a very underwhelming visit to the Tower.  This should be an iconic landmark. The Tower is very significant in British history and let's face it, not many museums have world-famous crown jewels to work with. Because we visited with someone who has life membership of English Heritage, we did not have to pay. Fortunately. If I had wasted the amount of time on queues to buy tickets, get onto the site, get in to the crown jewels, follow the crowds to see the jewels etc etc. and then paid more than £70 for the privilege, (two adults and a child), I'd struggle to be polite!  There are lots of characters in costume, but frankly, most add little except cost.  There is an absence of engaging displays for children (Beasts of the Tower looks very tired and limited), and little guidance is provided to parents on which parts of the Tower experience might suit different age groups. The whole site feels tremendously inefficient, lacks investment in meaningful visitor experience and fails miserably at bringing history or the significance of the jewels alive (there are so many ways this could be done especially given the money collected!).  This could be an experience which really entices international visitors to visit more and explore more of the history of England.   Instead, I'm amazed that more visitors don't complain about time and money that could have been better spent!",I cancelled and was given no refund
"May 30, 2019",When you search online it has the heading Tower Of London Tickets | Cancel 24H Prior & Full Refund    but if you read the fine print it says no refund is given.   This is false advertising     horrible customer experience.   shame on trip advisor.,"Fascinating, a must see"
"May 9, 2019","Don't be scared off by the  idea of a long que. The Tower and the Crown Jewels are absolutely a must see in London. Purchase a ticket voucher online in advance, then you just go to the group ticket window and redeem the voucher for your tickets. Very quick. Do go early in the day and see the Crown Jewels first. The que gets longer as the day progresses. The Crown Jewels are amazing, and someone had the brilliant idea of a moving floor that carries people past them so the line keeps moving. But not to worry, you can go back and pass by them again, or you can move up to the overlooking stationary platform and look longer. The history of the tower is amazing. Don't miss the tiny, tiny staircase up to the ""Bloody Tower"" where the little princes were imprisoned. You can spend 2 hours, or and entire morning. It is fabulous.",Beefeater Tour 
"February 26, 2019","Seeing the Tower of London with a Beefeater Tour was an excellent way to view this historic property. This requires pre-booking which I did online prior to coming to England. It was pretty thrilling to see the Crown Jewels, unsettling to view the execution place of Anne Boleyn and then the chapel where she was buried. Walking up the winding tower stairs to where various prisoners were kept - some who never made it out alive - was eerie as many had carved their names into the stone walls. Definitely an important place to see and experience while in London!",DISABLED - DON'T GO to Tower of London . DISGRACEFUL accessibility !
"January 28, 2019","As a Londoner I am ashamed that London's most historically significant building is mainly restricted to the able-bodied ! I came here with my 6 year old son who is in a wheelchair. We paid a whopping £14 child ticket only to find out that only 10% of the buildings can be accessed by a wheelchair. Guess they don't want to spend the money !. Lots of excuses about no lifts in a historic buildings etc. Red herring - decent ramps are simple and easy to install. Come on Historic Royal Palaces, do the right thing and create a building that doesn't DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE DISABLED !",Amazing visit
"January 16, 2019","Must see when in London. As i remember entrance was about 30 Us Dollars(and it worth every penny). and it will take you like 3 hours to finish this tour.. consider visiting the tours bridge, belfast (the ship, and u can finish eating at the borough market.  ",Our guide Laurence was fantastic 
"January 15, 2019","Myself and my partner decided to go to the Tower of London because we were doing a bus tour of the city and felt it was something we should do. It was a bitterly cold , miserable day but our guide Laurence was just brilliant so we barely noticed that we were frozen solid ! He had a wonderful way of telling the history  to us & as horrific as the stories were he made them enjoyable constantly interacting with the crowd and especially involving the kids , I would think there was around 200 people in our group but his booming voice and wonderful attitude meant that nobody missed out on what he was saying .",sound and light show commemorating WW1
"November 12, 2018","During the week of Nov.3-10, 2018 the Tower of London was the site for an amazing event commemorating WW1. The combination of light, fog (technical and real), sound, voice and movement was brilliantly presented. The weather with its torrents of rain set a scene of trenches and misery. 45,000+ people watched for about 45 minutes, all in silence. One heart remembering the horror and sacrifice. We will always be thankful for those who served and fought for freedom. May we never forget and always work to find solutions other than war.",Wonderful visit
"November 10, 2018","The Tower if London is fascinating. It is amazing that it is still active. We could not get to see the the Crown Jewels on Saturday, the lines were just too long. Since we had a London Pass, we went back on Monday and walked right in! They are beautiful and with the second trip.",By all means PRINT your tickets before arriving!
"June 12, 2017",If you purchase tickets on line before your visit (and there is a substantial discount to do so) by all means PRINT the tickets before you arrive. The web site says you can go to the group tickets window to pick up your prepaid tickets. We are waiting in a crazily long queue on a Monday morning. If I had known this I would have paid full price for tickets on site (much shorter queue). Now we'll never get to see the Crown Jewels. So disappointed in the pre-purchase ticket pickup process at the Tower of London!,Incredible - Must do the Beefeater tour
"May 6, 2017","We got to the Tower before opening time so were among the first to go in which was great because we were able to go through the Crown Jewels display with hardly anyone else in there before heading back out to the first Beefeater tour.  There were so many people waiting (i'm guessing nearly 100) for the tour that we nearly decided to wait until a later one, but once the guide started he kept the whole crowd entertained, and involved.  It was fanastic how he well he presented the tour.  He was also very funny especially considering the grim and gruesome content of his talk.  I would definitely say this is an absolute must when coming to London. After the tour, we went through the White Tower which was really interesting and then explored the other sections. We used the National Rail 2for1 voucher here as well",One of our best days in London!
"April 24, 2017","This was a must-see.  Be sure the see the jewels, the line looks long but it goes fairly quickly.  Buying line hopping passes ahead doesn't save much time at this venue",Immerse yourself in history
"February 10, 2017","Be prepared for line ups...long line ups to get in because of bag checks. Line goes quickly though. Get there when it opens in the morning. First thing to do is get a map and go immediately to the crown jewels. If you wait for the tour, there will be a line up about a mile long to see the same jewels. SEE THE JEWELS FIRST! Then, you can go back to the moat for the crowded beefeater tour which is included in your ticket price. Very entertaining and informative with some humour thrown in for good measure. He will point out buildings, but will not go into them. Go after the tour. You can also get audio guides for a fee and skip the tour, but only get the guides AFTER you see the jewels. The jewels are pretty spectacular, and the bonus is that if you get there early, you can see them alone and go through as quickly or as long as you like, otherwise uou'll be snaking along in there like a snail; I kid you not.  As the day goes on, it will get really busy. You might want to go into the white Tower right after the jewels as there are line ups too, but no where near as long as for the jewels. The tower has armour. You can see a couple of armour suits from King Henry  XVIII; one was for a slim man in his 20s, the other was fitted for an obese man in his 40s. Quite a difference from his youth and the result of a severe jousting injury to his leg which resulted in a sedentary and very painful lifestyle for the unfortunate king. There are also cannon, guns, swords, pikes, horses armour and much more. There are also a few videos inside for you to enjoy.In the prisoner rooms, you will see the names of famous condemned people who scratched their names, initials or sayings in the stone. One of them was the young, 16 year old, princess Elizabeth who luckily was later released and became England's greatest queen.Outside, there is the place where the wretched Anne Boleyn met her death on the block by a French executioners sword by order of her husband. This is also the place where the teenage Lady Jane Grey, queen for just 9 days and beaten and forced to marry against her will was also beheaded by Mary I whose army overwhelmed the tower. There are many gift shops throughout the tower with different price ranges. You will also be surprised to find the eremains of the former zoo, once full of exotic animals who were gifted to various royals and who met their untimely demise in the dank London air and atmoshere.Throughout your visit, there are theatrical plays going on that encourage audirpence participation. Don't expect to be sitting down either as you will be moving around with the costumed actors from one place to another. It was quite entertaining! The one I saw told the story of William the Conqueror of znormandy, France and Harold I of England. The audience had to take sides on who they thought should be king, then plan their attack. Great fun for all ages, and lots of comic relief there too! You can see this in pictures of this story if you go to Bayeux, France to see the 1000 year old Bayeux Tapestry. The visit to the whole Tower complex easily takes 3 hours or more, and don't rush through as you can learn a lot. It is a must see important site of British history. Note, that there are cobblestones and narrow stairs everywhere. Not good for wheelchairs or strollers, but I did see both. ","Awesome, full of history!"
"August 20, 2016","So much has already been written about the Tower of London, so I'll keep it short.1. Buy tickets online to skip the line. Also, see the Crown Jewels first as the line grows throughout the day.2. Set aside 3-4 hours if you want to see everything.3. Go on a tour. The beefeaters are friendly, funny, and charismatic. ",Get a tour with the Beefeaters and you will love every minute of it!
"July 26, 2016","We had a great weather to visit this fabulous structure and while the ticket price is steep in my opinion (25 pounds for an adult!) thanks to to free tour with one of the Beefeaters it was all worth it!. We learned a lot of the gruesome history, the intrigues, the murders, while being entertain at the same time. The Crown Jewels were beautiful and we spend quite a bit of time just walking the walls and imagine the times of the Kings and Queens that inhabited this palace so long ago! Go in the afternoon, there is so much less people and you won't have to queue to go and see the Crown Jewels.",Amazing place full of history and great stories.
"June 26, 2016","This was our first visit to the Tower and we absolutely loved it! I researched for helpful tips for visiting and found some, which indeed made our trip here nice and fairly easy:- Choose the lesser evil: visiting during weekdays there's usually lots of student groups but then again on Saturday and Sunday there's bigger chance for large masses of people.- GO EARLY. Check the opening times and go there as soon as the place opens. If you want to see the crown jewels, DO THEM FIRST. Memorize the map of the Tower and learn the way to the jewels, so that you can walk directly there. When we did this, we didn't have to stand in lines, just walked right in. Two hours later there was a long line outside the building.- There are fair amount of stairs to climb, if you truly want to see as much as you can in one visit.- Do take water with you. You can buy bottles of water, beer and soft drinks among other refreshments from the Tower too (the cafe on the East side) but they are a bit costly.- Reserve hours for this sight. One or two hours even is not enough!- If you are under 18, you can not not buy things like letter openers (shaped like swords) from the gift shops. I saw someone wanting to buy a letter opener, but she was declined when she turned out to be 17.",Impressive Collection of Crown Jewels and Armor in Historic Castle/Prison
"August 13, 2015","Our trip to London was a bit last-minute so I rushed to put together a sightseeing itinerary. We knew we wanted to go to Tower of London to see the Crown Jewels (well, I did, anyway) but had no idea that we would be seeing multiple crowns (as well as staffs and swords) dating back to King Charles II (1660s); I expected only to see the current (Queen Elizabeth II) Crown Jewels. WOW!!!!  Spectacular. In addition, the armor of past kings on display in the White Tower, which we went through to get to the Crown Jewels, was amazing.Recommendations: (1) Plan a minimum of two hours. In this amount of time, you'll be able to view the exhibits in the White Tower, the Crown Jewels and take a brief walk on the wall surrounding the Tower of London and looking out onto the Tower Bridge. This was two hours at a fairly brisk pace. That said, don't be discouraged by the long line for the Crown Jewels. It actually moves really fast...about 10 minutes from the very end to the door. (2) check AT LEAST the day before you plan to visit  to see if there are any special events taking place on the grounds that you might want to see and plan your visit accordingly. We arrived at about 3 pm and had JUST missed a medieval jousting demonstration (horses, armor and all) because I wasn't aware if was occurring which was a bit of a bummer; (3) Realistically, you can easily spend a full day (or more) exploring the grounds and (4) No need to purchase tickets ahead of time. The grounds are quite expansive and can accommodate many people at once.",Nice for a day trip
"July 28, 2015","The ideal time to visit London’s attractions are in mid-summer. But there again most of the fellow tourists already know that and hence it is extremely busy. A visit to the tower of London, adjacent to Thames and near the iconic London Bridge is a nice addition to one’s tourist itinerary.","Interesting, Historic and Great Fun!!"
"July 3, 2015","I went here with my girlfriend recently.It is quite expensive but in my opinion it is well worth the money (£54 with a programme).The journey around took a long time which is great, several things to see, the crown jewels, the tower itself which is a 4 level museum, the royal fusiliers regiment HQ (I think it was theirs).Nice, reasonably priced cafe on site with great flapjacks.... and I know my flapjacks....All in all:Great visit.Super interesting.History is great.Architecture is beautiful.Loads to see.",Diamonds & Beefeaters
"June 22, 2012","I loved this visit, the diamonds are amazing, the Beefeater guides are very knowledgeable and full of fun... look out for the graffiti carved in the walls of the prison cells by their poor inmates awaiting the gallows!",History compromised for profit
"April 1, 2012","Bitterly disappointing since going as a child. £20 entry to overcrowded empty exhibits. Aside from Henry VIII jousting armour, little number of exhibits. Am sure the crown jewels were more exhaustive when last visited. White Tower was good on ground floor but got progressively banal as you climbed the crowded stairs.Then to top things off, after waiting a couple of hours for the church service to end, was told only Groups are allowed in the Chapel Royal!!!! DisgustingWill NEVER visit again and if you're in any way disabled or infirm, be prepared for many cobbles and stairs. Little evidence of disabled access. Such a shame for our heritage to be treated this way. ",Get ready to be processed.
"March 15, 2012","Pay the heavy entrance fee and then set off on the one way system through the Tower, miss anything and want to go back, forget it, bit like being in Ikea. And then! pay extra to get a glimpse of the Crown jewels after an interminable queuing experience. When finally getting into the jewel room I was tapped on the shoulder by an attendant and told to move along when I dared to stop for a closer look!   Give it a miss, go to the wonderful museums available in the city. Nearly all free!",Put This At The Top Of Your List
"January 9, 2012","This was a London attraction at the top of our ""must see"" list.  We are glad it was.We purchased our tickets ahead of time and saved a bit of time.  The line to enter the exhibit seemed long but it moved very quickly.Once in the exhibit, we were most impressed--from start to finish.  The swords, crowns, and other jewels are stunning.  I highly recommend this!","Great choice, tour a must!"
"October 27, 2011","We were low on cash whislt in London, so we could only see and do a smahll handful of things. I was debating whether this was going to be a good choice for our coin, but afterwards I was so glad we did. We went reasonably early on in the day, and lucky we did, there is so much to see and do. We spent all day there and still didnt see everything.When we arrived, we tagged along with a tour led by one of the Warders. He was so entertaining and was a great character. It was in no way cheesy and he managed to get many genuine laughs from a large audience. He was so informative and if that was the only thing we had of got out of our Tower visit, we would have left happy.We saw the Crown Jewels and explored the rest of the castle. There are so many rooms and pathways, we didnt quite get to see it all. We needed a break during the day so we went to one of the cafes and enjoyed some tea & scones. They were reasonably priced and were delicious. Being Australian, we didnt have a great deal of English History or Royal Knowledge, but this has really generated our interest and thirst for more.I highly recommend a visit here and definatly try to get involved in the guided tour.",More than a piece of history
"October 26, 2011","I'd never realized the tower was not just a tower, forgive my ignorance... It was such a good visit, I must tell you.Tips: Be there at 10 am, no queues. Buy your tickets at the gift shop at the exit of the Tower Hill subway station, way cheaper.The place is so well taken care of, it's worth a bunch of photographs. There's a lot to see: the scaffold site, the Bloody Tower, the Crown Jewels, the Fusiliers'Museum, the White Tower, the Medieval Palace, the Traitor's Gate seen in so many movies and tv series. It can take a couple of hours but it's totally worth it. The Beefeaters are really nice to you and answer all of your questions with a smile, great!And if you still can manage, go up Tower Bridge, the view is amazing!",Brilliant day out
"September 21, 2011",I went to the Tower of London with a friend while in london recently. We spent the entire day there and loved it. We arrived just as a beefeater tour was due to start (these are included in entry). he was fabulous. Very engaging and interesting. After the 60min tour we got the audio guides and self-directed around the tower. the only downside of this was that the handset is not one with headphones. there was a jack for the smaller insert but not the general one - only downside was that it is annoying carrying the set around at your ear. otherwise an very enjoyable day and a great attraction for all ages,History That You Can't Pass Up
"September 18, 2011","For those of you that will be staying more than 3 days or so I would suggest getting the paper travelcard.  They have 2 for 1 admission specials on their website and the Tower of London is one of them.  If you have time I would suggest taking free Yeoman ""Beefeater"" tour.  They do in fact live there so it's nice to hear from someone who takes pride in what they do.  The crown jewels are the main attraction and we didn't have to wait long as we went early afternoon before the crowds started to arrive.  There is plenty to see as you walk the grounds and on top of the inner wall.  There are plenty suits of armour as well as interactive displays in the White Tower.  You can easily spend more than two hours here so be prepared to take your time.  Afterwards you can go up the Tower Bridge, often confused for the London Bridge, there was only one walkway that was operational when we went but we also had a 2 for 1 admission coupon so it was pretty cheap.",Great Experience...well worth the cost
"September 11, 2011",I am so happy I chose to visit here. I was only in London for a day and a half and had to decide out of all the attractions which to take advantage of. Everything is a bit pricey but the Tower London which I ended up spending about half a day was worth it. There is so much to do and learn here... Much more than just the crown jewels if you enjoy history.,Getting to the roots of London
"August 27, 2011","Although whilst on  holiday I always visit a landmark or attraction to enjoy the experience, I always make it a point to get a little bit of history of the visited locality. Tower of London is surely a landmark in London just as the Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Yet to visit the tower of london you need at least three hours.  This place is full of history surrounding the attrocities committed by certain medieval kings and queens.  Make sure you get to the Yomen tour which is included in the entrance ticket. This tour starts every half an hour from the internal main gate of the tower of London. It is very informative and at the same time enjoyable.  There is so much to admire inside this place even though this place is more for adults. Yet children will also enjoy themselves even if if a bit tiring getting from one building to another. nevertheless a visit to the tower of london is a must and not to be missed,  Also do not forget the ceremony of the keys which is held at about 8.45pm. This ceremony is only for ticket holders which anyone can get for free at least two weeks before the visit.",Don't miss this one!
"April 26, 2009","The Tower of London was a highlight of my first day on a recent trip to London.  The history, the legend, the crown jewels, the yeoman warders and their stories all work together to make an unforgettable experience.  If you want a taste of authentic history, make this a priority.  Wear your walking shoes, climb the towers and soak it all in.",My favorite spot in London
"April 5, 2009","The Tower of London was my favorite stop in London during our four day visit this past week.  Although a little pricey to enter, the Tower is full of interesting sights and the Beefeater tour was outstanding.   Note that the Beefeater tours can get quite large, but our guide (and the others we saw) were very adept at dealing with such large groups.  Plan to get there early though before it gets to busy.  I would recommend planning to spend 2-3 hours there, if not more.",Excellent visit!
"February 13, 2009","I love places with history and Tower of London is definately one of them. I read here a couple of negatice comments about this attraction, but on my point of view these are due to lack of knowledge on the tower, or limited interest on historic facts and old building. But then, why go there then? Everyone is entitled to his/hers opinion of course, so...I visited for first time at the end of January. I made it there about 14.15, excellent timing as last guided tour was on 14.30 . There were no queues at all, maybe due to time of the year (no peak season).Our Beefeater was Alan. Alan has a nice singing voice, I first though that he is of Irish or Northern England origin, but he said he comes from South West England or something. Anyway, I loved hearing his voice, and I could understand him too (I am a foreigner and that's important!) Tour was informative and funny, and Alan helped everyone to create an image on his mind of how things were in the Tower some centuries ago. Very nice and lively commentary! We got to see the Chapel too, which is open only when on a tour I think.After the guided tour, I spend nearly two more hours there, but there were not enough! I saw the Crown Jeweleries, no queues here too, and I wonder in the various different parts of the tower, watched Beefeaters and Guards going on their usual buissiness and rituals, and of course I spotted lots of ravens. I liked the views towards Tower Bridge too, and towards the execution place and the ex-Port Authorities building which is now owned by an insurance company or something. Time was not enough, and I am sure I should have missed something, no matter how much I tried to explore around. Some maintenance seems to be going on parts of the Tower too.I'd like to come back,to take an audio next time. It would be interesting to have information on more details and smaller items that may have not be explained on the guided tour.A very pleasant visit if you are the kind of person that loves history!",very interesting place
"December 5, 2008","I visited the Tower of London with my 13 year-old son ( we come from Spain ) in May. I was happily surprised that the visit really was worth the ticket. The Beefeaters' tour was absolutely entertaining, they explained every aspect ( past and current )of the place in a very amusing way. We spent nearly four hours wandering in the fortress, listening to the Beefeaters and enjoying such a interesting place. I have visited London several times, but it was the first time I visited the Tower. We had Mr. Jones ( one of the nice Beefeaters ) touring our group and he was most friendly, helpful and profesional. Thank you Mr. Jones, we really enjoyed your guided visit, it was fantastic!I had just watched The Tudors TV series on TV and it was amazing and thrilling to be at the same location, especially when we got to know where Anne Boleyn was executed.My son, who was inicially reluctant to join the visit, enjoyed the place and the guided tour very much,I definetly recommend this visit.Greetings from Spain!",Definitely a must see
"October 24, 2008","One of the must sees in London.  We got there too late to get in the first day we were in London, so we got food from the street vendor and a bottle of wine and glasses from one of the pubs nearby and brought it back to eat and drink at one of the tables by the River Thames.  One of the most enjoyable memories I have of London.We did manage to visit the Tower of London later in our trip and it was spectacular.  The White Tower, as well as the Crown Jewels, are not to be missed.  The Crown Jewels had a little bit of a Disney Land feel, with the conveyer belts carrying you by the display to avoid people from gawking and creating a bottleneck, but are breathtaking nonetheless.",A Fun Afternoon!
"October 21, 2008","The Tower of London is a major reason for visiting London. The Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters) are funny, informative and give great tours. The Tower houses the Royal Crown Jewels which are a treat to view. The history lesson you get during the tour will stay with you, especially when you come home and watch historically based movies:)Buy your tickets before you get there as there are always crowds. Many hotels can sell you tickets and the Big Bus Tours both have stops right outside the perimeter so it is easy to get there. There is also a tube stop right outside the Tower area.",fantastic
"September 24, 2008","My daughter & I were in London for 7 days in late 2007.One day we walked  & walked and ended up at  the Tower of London. We hadn't planned on being part of a guided tour. But as one was starting when we got there we decided to tag along.It was just fantastic. The Beefeater who was our giude was sensational. He was funny, a great storyteller, & had  a vast knowledge of history.My advice to anyone visiting London is to make sure you do not forget to go to the Tower of London. I hope you are lucky enough  to have the guide we had. An experience not to miss.Shirley & Amanda",Must See in London
"June 20, 2008","Everyone should visit the Tower when in London (early in your visit so that you can get a good history lesson that applies everywhere).  Arrive early in the day, skip the Beefeater tour and head right for the crown jewels (before the crowds), then go back and get the Beefeater Tour.  The guards are very knowledgeable and tell funny stories (they do, kiddingly, pick on your children - my teens thought they were hilarious!  We also enjoyed a short show with peopel in period costumes doing some fencing and sword play.  The prices are high, but well worth it!",Great Place to visit!
"May 26, 2008","This is a great place to visit while in London. I would deffinitely suggest getting the guided audio tour as you learn so much more then you would just reading the descriptions.  The Tower Bridge is also about  a 3 minute walking distance from the Tower of London and worth the walk across (didn't pay to walk above but walked the pedestrian path across).  t was raining all day when we went to visit but it was still worth the trip.One other suggestion, if you have time, is to head over to the National Gallery (free of charge) once finished with the Tower of London so you can put a face to the Kings, Queens, prisoners etc. you just learned about at the Tower.",A must see experience in London
"August 10, 2007","The Tower of London is a must see for anyone traveling to London for the first time. When going there, I notice there was no line for buying tickets, which is great. The tours happen every half of the hour (ex. 10:30). But check on this as it may have changed. The best thing is the guild tours are free (by the Yeoman Warders dressed in red suits when I went to visit). It takes about 3 hours to see everything, but worth it. If english is not your native language they do have a rental place where you can rent a headset which will talk about the Tower of London as you walk around it (I think it is about 5 pounds in price). ***phil",Don't miss it!
"October 9, 2019",Be prepared for lots of stairs... But totally worth it! This is an amazing must see stop in London!! ,Tower of London
"October 8, 2019","We prepaid our entry to avoid the long lines and were very glad we did! We loved our history lesson from the guide who is a Yeoman guide, it was very interesting and being a great story teller he had us shocked and laughing within minutes.",Tower-ing history
"September 29, 2019","First and most important with all tourist attractions is Buy Your Tckets First, typically on line through multiple providers to get discounts and more importantly avoid the ques to enter which at times can stretch for over 1.5hrsOkay so you've done that and you're at the entry, with your backpack, camera, water bottle and or sunscreen / umbrella for London's uncertain weather. Next, take the guide booklet and enjoy the immensity of what is a renowned London landmark that has to be seen. Whilst its historical place is world known nothing prepares you for what you see until you're actually there. From the grand entrance, through the grounds with the various exhibits and demonstrations featuring recreations of the period to the crown jewels allow yourself a good couple of hours to absorb all the Tower has to offer. There is adequate seating in the grounds to rest, eateries to quench your appetite and thirst along with the obligatory gift shops for souvenirs catering to all tastes and budgets, it's a wonder Lloyd's bank aren't there to offer a personal loan or three... August through September weather was spot on for an Aussie used to the highs and lows our ever changing climate can throw at us, so if London is on your list of great cities to visit, plan ahead, get on line and get amongst it.",Wonderful castle 
"September 21, 2019",Always a great visit and the Crown Jewels are fabulous. It is well put together and you can also join a free tour with one of the beefeaters for a bit of local flavour.Children well catered for as well with specific activity book for them to follow along.,A fascinating series of buildings going back to around 1200
"September 15, 2019","Generally speaking well maintained, the are different areas with fascinating stories to tell, from zoos, to prisoners, and spies and historically it takes you right up to the World War II; there is a good cafe area, and events for all (period costume), Beefeaters with their wonderful stories, irony and sarcasm, resident ravens, display panels, etc. Routes are organized into one-way systems which assists the flow. Entrance fees per adult are now about 27.50 sterling (or 30 with a donation) per adult and 75+ for two adults and up to three children. So, if you are intending going ensure you make the most of your visit, go early enough and allow as a minimum three hours. At closing time the Beefeaters are good herders, which they do with a lot of wit, and very thoroughly and you will not be allowed to stay even a minute or so beyond closing time.",Great way to learn history of England
"September 13, 2019",This was a very crowded day for us.  We had to wait in the line to see the crown jewels for an hour.  But it was worth it.  So beautiful with some incredibly large gems.  There is a lot to see in this area.  Many families with children where there and seemed to be enjoying themselves,Ripped off by Trip advisor

"August 20, 2019",The Tower of London was the best part of our trip to London. The history of the building and the architecture makes you feel you are back in time!

"August 17, 2019","My wife and I visited here for second time as were here 7 years ago. Wanted to spend more time as we loved the site and exhibits. The key to this place is go early. Not sure why folks would subject themselves to crowds and long lines when it's avoidable? We took tube, got to Tower Hill station at 830, walked to entrance and were with the first 50 people there at 840. Buy your tickets before hand to avoid the ticket purchase line here and process, go straight to line for entry. There are no priority lines,everyone with a ticket is the same.They open promptly at 9, think it's later Sunday/Monday.Line was about 250 people by 900. We went right in and to the Building with crown Jewels display. Walked right in, no crowds, casual experience and amazing!By 1100 the lineups for the crown jewels section were over 2 hours long and the place was noticibly busier everywhere. By that time, we had enjoyed the most popular sections and without crowds for the most part. It was VERY busy when we left at 1200 and large groups strwaming in. This is a quality and unique experience, but not if you come at a the wrong time! Do yourself a favor and arrive 20-30 minutes before opening and you'll enjoy it so much more.",Must see the Crown Jewels

"August 2, 2019",I love everything to do with the Tudor era and was itching to come here on our latest visit to London as I haven’t been since I was a Teenager. For peak season we didn’t have to fight the queues too much. We booked the audio tour for £5 each but I don’t think we needed it and they got quite weighty by the end. Of course the highlight was seeing the Crown Jewels- we didn’t get rushed along at all. Would thoroughly recommend a day here. We spent 3 hours and still didn’t do everything! ,summer visit
"July 29, 2019","This is not a tour, merely a pass for all 3 places, we exchanged our paper booking into the tickets at the Tower of London. get there as soon as they open as the queues get crazy. you will be given a pass that is valid for 2 years. i would say it is impossible to visit all 3 in one day. but is easily manageable over 2 days. all the places are enjoyable and can be done at your own pace, plenty to see and do at all 3 places. there are security checks at the entrances so carry as little as possible, these do not take long. all in, enjoyable places to visit",Worth Your Time
"July 25, 2019","If you have even the slightest interest in English history, you have to tour The Tower. Myself, I am fascinated by the Tudors and many of them have spent time here.  After all, who hasn’t heard the tale of Anne Boleyn?The Tower is actually part of a huge fortress. I suggest you take a beefeaters tour (as I recall it’s free) you’ll learn the history of how this complex came to be. In any case you’ll see “Traitor’s Gate” through which Anne Boleyn entered The Tower just days before she was convicted and beheaded.Couple of tips, get your tickets in advance on line and go first thing in the morning. Best to arrive about 30 minutes before it opens. The line will be long but the area is photo worthy so you’ll be easily distracted by your surroundings. Also, once the doors open the line moves surprisingly fast.",History Overload!

"July 20, 2019","It’s a cliche and most people go here, but it is worth it. It is an incredible landmark full of Western history. This is a large complex. Most guidebooks said to leave 3 hours to visit—we spent 3+ hours and still missed a lot. Some tips: Go early. This is a popular attraction. We got in line about 30 min before it opened and the line behind us was pretty long. Go to see the Crown Jewels first. They have to limit the number of people who go in at a time. We went directly there and only waited about 5 min. An hour later, the queue looked like the line at Space Mountain. There are also free tours every 30 min. We skipped it because the crowds were huge, but it might be worthwhile. Make sure you print tickets before you go. They don’t accept any electronic vouchers, or emails. Those who failed to read this ended up waiting in the queue to get in only to be sent back to the ticket office when I hey reached the gate. The only downside is that by mid morning it became so crowded, it wasn’t really enjoyable anymore. That’s July travel in Europe. The other downside is that, interesting as it is, you are reminded that human beings can do some awfully horrible things to each other. ",More than expected
"July 19, 2019","So full of history. I was completely surprised to find that the Tower of London is a large white palace that is not visible until you are inside the walls.    So cool!   There’s almost 1000 years of history in those walls.  We chose to do the Yeoman Warden Tour with a beefeater and am so glad we did.  His name was Gary and he was so informative.  He was also very funny!  Look up the requirements to become a beefeater.  It’s actually quite fascinating.  The Crown Jewels were worthy to visit.  They are beautiful.   We got to the Tower about 10 on a Wednesday, did the Yeoman Warden Tour, then went to see the Crown Jewels.   There was no line at that time.   We went right in.  We did tour the Actual white tower.   There are lots of cool armor suits and weapons displayed. I wish there had been more about the actual building itself.  It is beautiful. We also at at the little cafe.  We both thought the soup and sandwiches were good. Glad we did this tour.   It is surprising how many people have been to or live in London who have never actually been inside.  Make sure to go ",Amazing historic site!  Get there early!
"July 12, 2019","The London Tower and Westminster Abbey are THE most popular attractions in London. (Well, and Buckingham Palace, but I visited in June and Buckingham wasn't open for tours until July). You MUST get there before opening if you want to avoid long lines. My friend and I only had 2.5 days to visit London, so we arrived at the Tower before opening the morning after we flew in. There were hoards of people walking to the entrance already and we headed there promptly with our London Pass cards in hand. While other attractions simply scan your London Pass card at the entrance, I soon discovered that The London Tower does not. You're required to go back to the ticket office and get a paper ticket. Lame. Luckily, we were there early and hadn't waited in line at the entrance just to be sent to a line at the ticket counter; otherwise, I would not have been a happy camper. But in June before 9, there were no lines, so we turned around and walked back to the ticket office and got the lame paper tickets and then came back to the entrance and handed them to the ticket collector. By now the Tower was just opening, so there still wasn't a line at the entrance. We just breezed right in. Sadly, in July and August, that is NOT the case. You can expect a long line before opening, and it only gets worse as the day goes on. *London Pass holders have skip-the-line (fast pass) entry at the London Tower; however, the longest line forms at the Crown Jewels room, which is found on the other side of the fort once you're inside. THAT is why you need to be there before opening. You don't want to miss that room.We power-walked straight to the crown jewels room across the fortress (as many sage TA reviewers have advised) where a line had ALREADY formed. What?? HOW?!  How did they all get there??  It was only about a 20min wait to enter the room, but it irritated me nonetheless. This girl does not do lines. Once inside; however, the line steadily moved past the paintings and exhibit items. A little TOO steadily. Visitors ride conveyer belts past the sparkling crowns and jewels, and while I appreciated not having to wait for a crowd to move so that I could see, it also meant one quick glance at each item was all I got.  *Sniff*  *Tear*    )':     Moreover, visitors are not allowed to take pictures in there. Boooo! The best thing to do afterwards is go back to the entrance and take a yeoman free tour of the fortress. A new tour begins every 20 minutes or so. We didn't take one, though, because we were pressed for time with only 2 days to see London, so we quickly ran around the fort, reading signs, listening to the audios, and taking pictures. I wish now that I'd taken one, but I still learned a lot about the history of the fortress. If you don't have time for a tour, at least walk the ramparts and take a picture of the Tower Bridge in the distance. See the weapons room and London's first ""zoo"" of exotic and wild animals that the royals kept from the 13th - 19th Centuries. Climb the stairs to the bloody tower and learn the history of the prisoners who were kept there and about the two princes who were imprisoned there by their usurping uncle, King Richard. The fortress building from the inside isn't that awe-inspiring; it's actually more impressive to look at the fortress from the outside. The portcullis is pretty cool, though, no matter which side you look at it from. I listened with interest as a yeoman explained the importance and function of the gate. When you leave, walk along the Thames and look up at the Tower Bridge ahead. Then turn back and look at the fortress and admire the sheer size and strength of it. Though impressive, it's not the architecture that draws most people to this fortress / castle / prison - it's the history embedded in its walls. Even if you aren't a history buff, seeing this site will help you imagine the traditions, customs, politics, and perils that were inherently woven into the fabric of English society.",Tower of London
"July 10, 2019",I tried to reach someone at Trip Advisor Corporate in Massachusetts on July 5th. Couldn't reach a anyone and several voicemails were full.I'll be home on July 30th. Someone from corporate should call me before I write my review.,Visit
"June 14, 2019",Great place to visit with a friends and family lots of nice things to do and see and learn about staff and guards are very friendly,Humbled as a US citizen. 
"June 14, 2019",The history is so humbling to walk in the same rooms as Henry VIII and other sovereigns. The tours given by the Beefeaters were well worth the time.  We had Scott Kelly who used engaging humor to educate us. The cafe had great coffee and some ok food.  ,Visiting Tower of London is a must do
"June 11, 2019","It was a bit of a rainy day - no big deal. Great yeoman tour + crown jewels. Give yourself plenty of time to tour battlements, see exhibits, etc. Friends (they were both from London) said it was a ""must do"". Certainly they were right.",Be prepared for crowds 
"June 10, 2019",This is a must to see but get there early to beat the crowd. Don’t fall for buying the tickets at the kiosk in the underpass as you have to queue up in the group booking line that can take longer than the normal ticket line. Definitely do the tour with the yeoman as they are very informative and funny. The queues for the Crown Jewels looks long but it flows very quickly. Worth the wait. All the other exhibits are excellent as well ,Brilliant visit.
"June 10, 2019","So much history, so little time.Visit. A must see in London Cafe; a bit expensive for what you get.Listen to the free Yeoman Warder Tours to get a real feel for the Tower.Enjoy.",Amazing historical site but priority ticket not helpful
"June 10, 2019","Enjoyed visiting the Tower of London in late May.  There's many amazing sights to see and the recommended three hours for touring the Tower is not enough if you really want to enjoy it.  I would recommend at least 4.5 hours.  As for the priority ticket, the group travel line is often as congested as the regular ticket line...even early in the morning.  Perhaps we will there on a very busy day but we waited in the group travel line for at least 25 minutes.  That being said, it is cheaper to buy the tickets online regardless.The Tower of London is worth well seeing but think carefully about if the priority ticket price is worth it.  ",Great attraction and even better with the free tour
"June 8, 2019","We went to the Tower of London a couple of days ago and we lucky enough to join a tour with tour guide Clive. He was fabulous! Very knowledgeable, articulate, and funny. I would highly recommend going on the free tour and seeing the Crown Jewels.",Worth the time spent
"June 8, 2019","There’s a lot to see inside. My suggestion is to buy tickets online in advance. This will remove the flexibility of your schedule but you won’t have to queue that much. Get the earliest schedule and once inside, i suggest go to the crown jewel first as that’s where the longest queues are. It’s worth falling in line for of course. The star of africa is unbelievable. It almost looks fake because of the size of it. Then probably do the beefeater tour (it’s included in the ticket). They’re funny and informative. Then do the tour of the white tower. There’s also a lot to see inside. Also, if you come very early, your photos will be a lot better because of lesser people.",You have to see the Tower
"June 6, 2019","My wife and I visited with our adult daughter. The Beefeater Tour of the Tower was provided by Yeoman Warden Scott Kelly. His charge of about 60 tourists may have been daunting but he led us expertly and confidently through the tour.  He gave a lively, descriptive narration to point out the facts associated with the Tower. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the stories and history of the Towers' significance in the British psyche. We spent about 1 hour with his tour and then about an hour wait in the queue to see the Crown Jewels. It was worth the wait and the Crown Jewels are very impressive. One last thing.  Be careful of the ravens at the Tower. Do not feed them. It was a great afternoon and would go again with friends or family.",I Was Left Wanting
"June 1, 2019","When you pay for entry and the tour I have certain expectations.  Sure we saw the crown jewels, but I think of the Tower of London I think of the prison and the likely fate of transgressors.  The chapel where Ann Bolin is buried was closed.  The tower where most were kept, and the prisoner graffiti I saw as a teen, was closed.  There is a exhibition of torture tools.  Closed.  But we got to see the garden and a couple of Beefeaters.  There were plenty of people . . . why is everything closed or off limits?!  It was a let down for us and wish we had our money back.",Take the tour
"May 21, 2018",This place is great. Definitely a must see attraction while in London. We opted to take the tour that was offered. Our guide (beefeater)  was excellent. She had a great sense of humor which added to the over all enjoyment of the stories being presented.,"Totally worth it, spend there at least 2 hours"
"May 10, 2018","The tower of London is full of history, I recommend taking the tour with a guard as soon as you enter (they are every 30 minutes and the last one departs at 15.30pm in summer time) and then go through all the different towers and the white tower later.There is a lot to read and learn, the tour with the guard is only 45 minutes, so add to that at least 2 more hours. You will see:- different towers where they held prisioners (it wasnt a prision though)- The King's rooms (this was the Monarchy house for around 500 years)- The Royal Ravens- The current Crown Jewels- The torture machinery- The Chapel- The execution areaand moreEnjoy it!",Must See in London
"April 29, 2018",If you are interested in knowing anything about English history this is a must see.  Spent the most part of one day here in April and barely scratched the surface.  Best plan of attack - get there early - just a bit before opening - and if possible buy your tickets on line in advance (avoids one queue).  This place gets more crowded as the day wears on. Plan on spending at least 3 hours here!,Visit Medieval London
"April 12, 2018","The Tower of London is the premier attraction in London.  This was my second time at the tower and the tour was full of new and riveting information I hadn't heard the first time.  The Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters) conduct the tours and they have all been specially selected for their service to the Queen and their oratory skills.  Their knowledge and story-telling abilities are sure to have all ages hanging on every word.  You will not be disappointed by the tales of intrigue and torture that happened within the walls of ""The Tower"".The crowds were quite a bit larger this year so, it's a good idea to try to keep up with the Yeoman Warder when he moves from one location to the next.  While they project their voices very well, it can be difficult to hear if you get stuck at the back of the crowd.The yeoman warders will recommend visiting the crown jewels but, if there are other things you're interested in, such as the White Tower, forego the jewels.  As impressive as some of the jewels are, the exhibit isn't the most interesting thing in the tower.The chopping block where HenryVIII's wives lost their heads is no longer there but there is a modern display that marks the spot where it occurred.  Your visit to the tower will take several hours but you don't need to leave the tower to get some lunch.  There's a fairly good cafeteria with a decent variety of foods but a somewhat difficult seating situation.  Long rows of tables are close together and it can be difficult to navigate to one of the middle seats, while carrying a tray of food.Overall, I recommend everyone visit the Tower of London on your next trip.",A must see... The Crown Jewels
"April 5, 2018","This is one of the highlights of our trip and traveling with young children was not easy but the kids did well.  And one of the highlights was getting to the Tower of London and seeing the Crown Jewels.One word of advice right from the start... get there early and head straight to the back where the building is for the Crown Jewels.  It gets busy quickly and then the line extends for quite a bit.  We didn’t have to wait at all and walked right in.  The tour is all ages and did not disappoint.  I learns a lot about the history of the Crown Jewels and how the collection came to be.  Fascinating!!  Then we went to the big tower to start our tour there where you learned about the history of the Tower of London, and the people who took part in the building, restoring, rebuilding, etc.  We also learned a lot about the kinds and the succession of rulers and the armor and weapons used in battle.Great walk around the battlements and multitude of towers and even a separate building which houses the Museum of the Fusaliers, which I enjoyed but the young kids... not so much.  Great time for all... highly recommend this site for visitors!!",very busy weekend
"April 5, 2018","Had the Yeoman tour, Spike was his name, and boy did he entertain, was a great tour which tells you so much more than just walking around, was busy but it was easter",My #1 London Attraction
"April 2, 2018",We had a brilliant visit to the Tower. The history and customs are fascinating. And its a treat to have a guide from one of the Yeoman Warders who live on site... thanks Bob!!Nice to get the boat down the Thames from Westminster to approach London Bridge from a different angle.,SO MUCH HISTORY
"March 18, 2018",This place is awe inspiring! The history the events that happened here. We had success early in the morning with getting in to see the Jewels before the line got bad- listen to the Yeomen. If your time is super limited- see the Jewels and the White Tower.....,Worth a visit
"March 1, 2018",I’ve been to London a few times and only went to the tower on this last visit and can’t believe I waited this long. It is very much worth it’s entrance fee and more. So much information to absorb and a lot of interesting different areas to see. I went with fellow colleagues while on a business trip and honestly weather you are solo or with a group you will have a great experience.  ,Unbelievable history
"February 17, 2018","This place it's a must visit, from all the history to the amazingly architectural buildings. From the Crown jewels to the Traidors gate.. Two tumbs up",Incredible—but I honestly would have skipped the tour.
"February 6, 2018","I love Tudor-era history, I love castles, and I love swords, so you know that I was excited for the Tower of London. I finally tackled it on my last day in London. I had bought a ticket in advance, which was useful. The Line of Kings was probably my favorite part, a museum exhibit of suits of armor, swords, and more. It's several floors, and has all kinds of fascinating swords, daggers, guns, and more, as well as several incredible suits of armor for horses and kings, displayed wonderfully. The Crown Jewels were of course incredible (although—and I know this is shocking—I think the Scottish ones were much nicer). The Tower and its history are huge, and hard to take in even in a full half day, but the guides and signs are really helpful in walking you through the high points and the history. I saw a reenactment, which was fun; the wall has one of ~the~ best views of the Tower Bridge; and afterwards it was easy to catch the water taxi to other tourist attractions. I even got to see two of the ravens, and while people warned me that those ravens are bigger than any ravens I've ever seen, I still wasn't really prepared for it. You get to see several historical places of note, like the Stairs in the White Tower where the bones of two children, believed to be the princes who disappeared just before Richard took the throne in 1483, often believed to have been murdered. You see Traitor's Gate, and the famous places where Elizabeth I, Mary Queen of Scots, and more famous royals and rebels were brought in, imprisoned, beheaded, and more—there is a memorial to those beheaded at the Tower. I had a really great time despite how much my feet hurt, and it was a day packed with history and wonder.I wasn't a big fan, though, of the famous Yeoman Warder tour. It had fascinating history for sure. The most interesting information was about the warders more than perhaps the Tower—who they are, that they sleep there, what their duties are. But considering that I had to wait a long while for a tour packed with other people, it seemed rather short, and I was also extremely turned off by the repeated sexist language and jokes by my tour guide—I let his first joke about women running off to the jewels and men to the swords go, but after he'd made similarly weird, gendered statements about a dozen times, I was really over it, and exchanged an eye-roll of a glance with the woman next to me.",Impressive structure and amazing beefeater
"January 28, 2018","The structure itself is impressive: huge, very well-kept and stunning in its old beauty. We loved the tour with our beefeater Spike (#402) who made it really interesting and even funny, thumbs up for him! (If you ever read this, thanks a lot for today's tour!) Unluckily we didn't know the chapel was closed on Sundays due to functions so that was a bit of a disappointment because we would have loved to have a look at it once we had paid the entrance to the complex but nothing that couldn't be solved with a visit to the Queen's Jewels that are completely worth the Sunday crowd.",Fav place in London
"January 25, 2018",Love love love!! This place is so fascinating. The history is incredible and you MUST DO A TOUR with a beefeater. It was hilarious. Best tour guide I’ve had in years. You learn AND laugh a lot. The crowd jewels are here and gorgeous. I could have spent hours here. Must see in London!! ,Spike the Beefeater guide on our tour cares and was excellent.
"January 21, 2018","Taking the Beefeater tour at the beginning of your visit to the Tower of London is a must. This will help to truly help to bring past to life.  I applaud Spike for his informative and really witty tour. The tour takes about 40 mins and then you are free to explore for as long as you wish, give yourself plenty of time,  perhaps 3 or 4 hours.",Classic London!
"January 19, 2018","The Crown Jewels are not to be missed! So much history. Great tour. It’s bigger and more elaborate than I’d anticipated so,leave plenty of time to see it all. ",A historical oasis
"January 16, 2018",I didn't know what to expect from the Tower and in the end it was a highlight of my visit to London. So much to see and it is like an ancient village in amongst the hubbub of modern life. ,First time visitor tips
"January 1, 2018","Here’s our tips after visiting for the first time.We were lucky in that the crowds were nonexistent for our Christmas week visit, but I would think with larger crowds this advice would be even more applicable.Buy your ticket online and in advance. Print them out and skip most of the lines to enter by following the signs for ticket holders. Once inside you’ll see groups waiting for the virger tours. Walk on by for now (we’ll take that tour later) and head straight ahead looking for the sign directing you to the Crown Jewels (second left). Walk up the stairs and the building housing the jewels will be right there and hopefully a small line or none at all if you get there early enough.Once you’re done with the jewels you can either head to the white tower which you will be facing when you exit, or you can head back to the entrance to catch a virger tour. We headed back and joined a tour. One tip here would be that the groups gather near the sign that points to where they actually start. Follow the sign and go down the ramp and wait there.Your tour will end at the chapel near the Crown Jewels so if you didn’t visit the White Tower before now is the time. After exiting the Tower, head to the South Walk. It will be down the road just a bit after you exit. Take your time to view the rooms and the views from the fortresses defensive positions.I would allocate 2-4 hours to see the Tower. Read up on the Tower and it’s history before you go. Get pictures with a Beefeater (they’re super helpful and nice), and watch for the Ravens.",Always Wonderful
"December 9, 2017","We get to London with some regularity and about every 5 years we go back to the Tower.  We went last week and it excellent.  Our ""Beefeater"" was full of facts and every bit a perfect ambassador for the tower.  While you can see the tower without the guides, they add greatly to the experience. One is in awe when looking at the crown jewels.  The White building is full of history and exit thru the modern, seemingly mandatory, torture chamber now know as the gift shop. If you have not been to London, put this on the must see list. If you have seen before, return to see it again as it is a glimpse into both the good and the bad parts of history",AN EVERGREEN!
"November 19, 2017","If you go and visit London, you cannot help visiting the Tower! Please, go there three hours before closing.",Fascinating tour
"November 13, 2017",The tour around the tower grounds was fascinating. One truly gets an impression of old London life and royalty with its happier and devastating historical moments.,Living History
"January 15, 2019","This is a must-see stop forAnyone coming to London. Almost 1000 years of history in one place. If you really want to get an overview of London and British history, this is the place. Kings, Queens, traitors, criminals, victims and their tormentors—it all happened here. Jewels, armour, implements of torture, ravens, a church, medieval and Tudor buildings, a slice of all aspects of life in London through the ages. Take the Yeoman Warder tour, it is not to be missed!",Felt like true royalty 👑 
"January 2, 2019",We did not have a lot of time so we did not visit every part of the expansive Tower of London but we did make sure to see the Crown Jewels. You will probably be amazed at the large size of the line but it moves fairly quickly and I recommend you do not miss it; it is by far the main attraction. ,Super Tour
"December 27, 2018","We booked ahead on-line for the visit, and it mentioned we could have the beefeater tour.  It wasn´t too clear how to get that part of the tour, but it was right after the entrance-- every 30 min a beefeater would come up and start a tour.  Our guy was SUPER, SUPER, helpful.  Very informative, super funny and very knoledgable.  Told us the history in a way that young and old found it easy to capture.  Porbably one of the best tours we had",Excellent mix of outdoor and indoor touring
"December 12, 2018","Fascinating attraction that is a must see in London. The tour by the Yeoman Warders or ""Beefeaters"" is a must. The Crown jewels (assembled from many lands), as with most things that glitter, are interesting. The different towers offer some interesting glimpses into the past.Perfect for families with little children as there is ample outside space for them to enjoy but enough history and inside space for those curious to be satisfied.",History

"December 11, 2018","This is a very wonderful tour. We spent a full day there with my family. However, please note that purchasing the tour via TripAdvisor does NOT get you in earlier at all. In fact, it delayed the entrance process as we had to line up to get the tickets from group ticket counter!!! So what's the point of purchasing the tour in advance. That said, Tower of London is a must see if you travel to London.",A must see when in London
"December 3, 2018",A very good overview of the history of England. The white tower give a pretty good idea of haw the Tower developed during the years. The crown jewelry is amazing.,Must visit! 
"November 29, 2018","Would recommend anyone to visit here with an interest in history. It was a lot bigger than expected so there is plenty to see, it goes through the ages in different areas of the attraction. Seeing the actual armour worn by kings gone by was so interesting, as well as the Crown Jewels. If you book online it’ll save you some money perhaps, I would say it’s a reasonably priced attraction! Also plenty of opportunities to take some good pictures and get a great view of London. ",Great tour with Yeoman Jason
"November 26, 2018",My friend and I went on this tour last week.  Mr Jason was fun and interesting.  He gave good info and answered all of our questions.  I have been on this tour twice before but it always so interesting and fun.  ,Go Early!
"November 25, 2018","If you want to truly enjoy the Tower of London without the crowds, I would suggest signing up for an early morning tour. This will allow you to watch the changing of the guards and get you into the tower to view the crown jewels before the masses of people start filing inside. ","The White Tower - and the Crown Jewels, too!"
"October 25, 2017","On a recent visit to London, we anticipated long queues, and decided to make the Tower of London our first stop of the day.  We arrived about an hour before the site opened; took some time to photograph the Tower Bridge; and then stood at the entrance in the London Pass queue.  We were among the first to enter, and made a bee line for the Crown Jewels.  We had easy access without waiting, and we got to linger a bit in front of this spectacular bit of British history. The jewels are magnificent to say the least.  The 530 carat Star of Africa diamond cut from the 3100-carat Cullinen is on the great Scepter.  The Koh-i-Nor is on one of the crowns.  It's really a thrill to see some of these legendary jewels and regalia.We also took some time walking the walls of the Tower; we visited the Traitors' Gate; ogled the ravens; and visited the Bloody Tower with its rack.  We saved the White Tower until last, and were rewarded with a stunning display of armor, and a half dozen other interesting exhibits.  I took time at the Tower Green to think about the executions of some of the more famous prisoners of the tower including two of King Henry VIII's wives, Thomas More, and Lady Jane Grey.  It's a chilling feeling to be right where it all happened.I loved arriving at the Tower of London so early in the day.  This move saved us lots of time.  There are a couple of gift shops to visit as well.  I loved the shop just next tot he Jewel House.  Enjoy this must-see site when in London.",Tower of London According to Spike
"October 5, 2017","We took a tour of the Tower of London under the guidance of the venerable Beefeater better known as Spike. The decision to tour the Tower and all it has to offer should be on everyone’s list of things to do when visiting London and you won’t be disappointed.The tour itself is only about an hour in length and anyone can tour the grounds and buildings using the map and other information available on site but the tour with a Beefeater guide is quite the treat.First and foremost you do get a very good explanation about why the Tower was built and the stories about successive Kings, Queens and the intrigue and violence of the Royal Court of the day. More interestingly are the stories and how they relate to to-days world and how history shaped us.Oddly we think of pollution, as a problem of to-day but not so, pollution was a problem several centuries ago. The moat around the Tower was so polluted with raw sewage that it became a significant health hazard and after about 400 years or so the Royalty of the day agreed to have the moat filled in with sand and shells. It became a parade and practice area for the soldiers. The stories of the intrigues of the court and the violence can be felt as the tour progresses.The tour itself ends at and in Chapel Royal of St. Peter ad Vincula where you really learn about the background of the church and the number of people who were beheaded and buried there.Spike himself has quite the vocabulary and challenges people with questions or comments about the history and present day events. There’s a continuous banter, about England and the United States that is very friendly yet laced with a dry wit. Unfortunately there’s nothing mentioned about Canada in the exchange. However this oversight is easily forgotten as soon as Spike moves onto the next subject.In the Chapel Spike did take the time to explain how he became a Beefeater, the requirements and the staunch loyalty to the “Crown”. In fact there is no doubt in his mind that Prince Charles will become the next King. This came, as he was explaining his uniform and the letters and insignia on his uniform. What will the new King call himself? The question is, to be answered at some future time.This is a most highly recommended tour but after that there is still much more to see such as the Royal Jewels with everything from rings, Sceptres, Crowns, Swords etc. Quite a spectacular array.Fortunately there was also a “Food Fest” being held is a large section of the moat so we were also able to sample a large variety of foods and beverages. The Fest itself was not part of the tour but the passes we had gave us access.Overall the major consideration anyone should make is the time required to do the tour with the Beefeater and just walk around the site is time. Don’t be in a hurry, do not think it’s an in and out. You can easily spend 3 to 4 hours visiting and there would still be things to see.Yes, definitely a must see and do when in London.",Get there early
"September 23, 2017","We were told to get there early by friends and this is definitely the case. With gates opening at 9am on the Saturday, we got there at 8.45am. Stood around for a few minutes and then we could start to go in. Being early, there weren't that many people around. We went straight to the Crown Jewels. Walking through, with no pressure of crowds, we could take our time and actually enjoy the experience. We could walk through a couple of times within jumping an queues.Could even get close and personal with guards on duty. Great photo opportunities.The rest of the attraction was easy to navigate and still without too many people around it was a pleasure. As we left around 11.30, you could see the crowds had built considerably.",A must see!
"September 14, 2017","We took a guided tour of the Tower. While I wouldn't recommend that specific tour guide, I think a guided tour could be a good choice of this place, which is quite expansive. There is a lot to see, which could be done in under three hours if you don't mind missing the crown jewels. Otherwise you definitely need more time.",An absolute must!!!!
"September 14, 2017","So much great history explained by the Yeoman who effortlessly guides you through the most important areas.  His tales were beautifully explained with great drama and made the experience very memorable.  Thank you, Steve.....a great story teller.Once inside the grounds inquire about the area to wait for the next guided tour.  The only way to get the real history.  After the tour ends, explore the exhibits on your own.  Something for everyone.  My favorite was seeing the Jewel House.We bought the London Pass which allowed us priority entry.  Also saves money if you are visiting the best London sights.",Highly recommended activity
"September 1, 2017","Our family absolutely loved this tour. My husband and son were not really up on their British history, but they learned a lot and really enjoyed it. There is a lot to see, more than we thought, so this is at least a 1/2 day, if not more, excursion. I recommend waiting for the tour guide as they really add to it (especially our tour guide, he was fantastic, but sadly can't remember his name). There is a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes. We did not eat on site, but you are there a long time so eat in advance or take snacks (the onsite ice cream is wonderful). It is quite near the Tube station which makes it very convenient.",London visit
"July 13, 2017",Great place to visit. Such a rich history. It has everything for a complete family visit. Something to interest each member of the family. Crown jewels display is awesome. So is the armory. The guides ( royal wardens) are awesome.,Must visit
"July 12, 2017","This is a must visit tourist location and is a place covered by the London Pass.Get there early so you have enough time  to see everything.   When you enter, just past security on your left you'll see a small sign indicating when the next Yeoman tour will start- make sure you allow time to go on this tour.  The Yeomen (Beefeaters) are hysterical and knowledgeable and you'll have a great time learning about The Tower of London.   It's free.  Get in line to see the Crown Jewels even if you think you have zero interest in them- they're really cool and there's other things to see.  You're there anyway so go.In the building across from the jewels are armor and weapons displays.  Again,even if you think you have zero interest go.  The craftsmanship is amazing.The torture room is a huge let down. One small room with a rack.  That's it.  The line moves quickly so if you want to see the device, get in line.There are a few reinactments going on throughout the day- I suggest getting to the exhibits first and walking through the tower rooms and if you happen upon a the actors doing something, stop a moment and watch.This attraction should take about 3 hours- maybe longer depending on lines and how long you spend reading and looking at the displays.",Fantastic day out for all
"July 5, 2017","Five tips for a great day out with children or without - 1. GO EARLY!!! Especially if you are going with children. You won't regret getting up early when you see how much time you'll save. Book your tickets in advance and ideally have them sent to you before you go as even the pre-booked ticket queue builds up before opening time. If you have tickets to collect aim to be there 20 minutes before opening time. DON'T wait until the day before buying tickets and be there before opening time as queues develop very quickly.2. Do the Crown Jewels FIRST. Head straight to the centre of the Tower area and do this as you will be able to see more, spend more time on it and queue for a tiny fraction of the time compared to those who go later in the day. 3. Do the Yeoman Warden tour second. Head back towards the entrance and pick up one of the regular tours (included in entrance fee). Our YW was hilarious, knowledgeable and entertaining throughout and our children loved him. Not the dry boring experience they might have thought. Thanks to YW Thynne!!!4. Buy a guide book (not the children's one). It's great value, has excellent content and will enrich your experience.5. Be prepared to spend all day here. We spent 6 hours and it wasn't too long and not one minute was boring. Our children (11 and 9) were really engaged the whole time between the tour, Crown Jewels, towers, wall walk, ravens, museums and re-enactments (this last thing being put on for the kids and is again funny and educational at the same time).","That was nice place for visiting, also knights were amazing !"
"July 2, 2017","That was nice place for visiting, also knights were amazing ! Weapon room was very attractive and also jewelry room.",So much more than just the home to the Crown Jewels
"April 23, 2017","We really enjoyed our visit to the Tower of London. We used our London Pass to enter and getting through the ticketing process was very quick and easy. We received a guided tour given by a beefeater guide on the top of each hour and really enjoyed hearing the history and stories told to us. You get a lot of great back story about the history of this great place and it really helps bring the place to life. After the tour, you're free to explore the grounds further at your own pace and of course view the crown jewels. No photos allowed inside the hall that holds the jewels so put your cameras/phones away and just take it all in with your eyes. The jewels are stunning and quite unbelievable. I couldn't imagine visiting London and not including a visit here so make sure as you put your itinerary together, you include this incredible site.",A Disappointment
"April 15, 2017","I visited years ago, and came again now with my family. It is nothing like it was.First I'd like to say that I acutely appreciate the historical significance of the site. I remember the spirited, authentic and delightful guided tour given by the Beefeater guides - and add to that the crown jewels, so what's not to like right?Well - brace yourself. The crowds are massive now, and although the British do a good job handling it, there is no getting away from it. The queues are immense. The number of people with us on the Beefeater guided tour was well over 200. It was very hard to move from place to place - or to hear our guide through a throng of people. Moving through the tower castle itself was a challenge (did I mention its crowded?) and I found the newly arranged display within the caste - the armory collections - to be tremendously shallow and uniquely uninteresting.  It was as if they dumbed everything down to the level of a Disney attraction - which with the crowds and queues it now surely resembles. The crown jewels require standing in their own queue to get into the exhibit. The wait time looked to be easily more than an hour, with a queue stretching outside its designated area and around the entire castle, and hardly moving. We passed. Oh - and did I mention that it costs over 24 pounds per person?  One final note - all this is in April. I can't imagine what it's like in summer.We escaped from the tower and let out a sigh of relief. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.",We stayed here longer than we thought
"April 11, 2017","We printed a 2-4-1 National train ticket voucher from home, so for the 2 of us to get in it was £28. That included a £4 donation to maintain the tower. (So could have paid £24 for the two of us if we had declined it.) Since we saved on buying a second ticket we went ahead and happily agreed to pay it. There is really a lot to see at the tower. Once we got in, we walked past the Beefeater tour and went straight to the crown jewels. It is absolutely amazing to see them. There is a moving walkway that goes on the front and backside of the jewels and we rode the walkway several times each to see them from every angle. Afterwords, we went back to the entrance and joined a Beefeater tour. The tour was funny, informative, and interesting. Don't miss it. It is included in the admission price. Afterwards, we set off on our own to walk along the walls and visit the various buildings. This was actually a gift shop we bought something from. My husband bought a touristy shirt and I bought a small bag with the ravens adorning it. I think my bag was £2. Afterwards, we went out the exit directly across from the gift shop and sat in the small beer garden on the Thames with a view of the Tower Bridge. Great day. ",A Must See in London
"April 10, 2017","This was a wonderful and fascinating place to visit.  Our family loved it  DO NOT MISS THE free BEEFEATER Tour.  Lawrence was amazing.  Seriously, do not skip the Beefeater Tour.  ",Fascinating London History for All Ages...
"April 7, 2017","The Tower of London is a major attraction and has something to offer almost everyone. We had a limited amount of time and chose to take a self guided tour rather than the Warder's Tour. We spent about 2 hours wandering through the massive fortress and there is plenty to see. Not only is the fortress structure impressive, there are many great exhibits. Of course the Crown Jewels are not to be missed but the armor and weapons rooms are also real treats. The view of the Tower Bridge is spectacular and favorite photo spot.",Fabulous experience
"March 22, 2017","How lucky are we in the uk to have some amazing history to go and visit. We visited this amazing place with our kids a few years back but decided we missed most of what interested us. We had a fabulous guide by the name of Spike and his knowledge was 2nd to none with a brilliant talent to entertain as well. I love our countries history and never realised what we have here. Standing in the chapel inside the grounds of the tower amongst over 1500 buried famous people including Anne Boleyn, bought tears to my eyes and goose pimples everywhere. A brilliant display of weapons, amour, the crown jewels, ravens, and much much more, if your any where near you must visit and ask for a tour with Spike, great bloke and a gentleman. Thank you for a great day",So Many Laughs / So Much History
"March 16, 2017","I had never done the Tower of London tour and wasn't quite sure what to expect.  Let's just say, this was by far one of my most favorite tours ever.  The Beefeater, Mark, was a riot.  He shared history as well as humor.  If in London, you must visit The Tower of London.",Overpriced!
"March 13, 2017",Ended up not going in due to the price!   Travelling with my mum (78) we planned the London trip to include a visit to see the crown jewels but after getting there and being told 1 adult and 1 concession was £50 we walked away.  Outrageously expensive!  ,"Book ticket online in advance, & go in the morning when it opens"
"January 26, 2017","I've been to London a few times, have never been to ToL, till last visit back in October last year.  I was a bit hesitant, that it may be over crowded, & over touristy.  Yes, it's a bit touristy, & can be very crowded, but IMO, it definitely worthy of a visit, esp. If you are visiting from overseas.  It's not fair to rate this place a 3- star, when one did not get in to visit, because of crowds & expenses; it's not even fair or objective to rate when rather did not get to visit a place in depth.  My recommendation is to book your ticket in advance before your trip, you will receive your ticket by mail.  I got my before heading to London, & I went first thing in the morning in a nice cool sunny day, I was able to get into CoJ without any crowds or waits, I was able to take my time to truly appreciate what they have to offer. There are many points of interests inside ToL,  one could really spend at least 1/2 day there.  That's what I did, it got quite crowded when I was ready to leave at 1PM, with many large groups.  Research, learn & plan ahead, you will enjoy your visist, no only limited to this massive attraction.",Fantastic family trip out!
"January 14, 2017",Our kids (& us) loved the Tower of London. We went on one of the tours by the Yeomans - Yeoman Dave. He was fabulous so many people on the tour but no issues hearing him at all. The kids LOVED all the history and hearing about the gory details of executions! (kids aged 7 & 9). We were there for 3 hours but could have spent much longer we didn't see everything we wanted but ran out of time sadly. We will go back next trip again.,Excellen Tour Guide
"July 21, 2016",We arrived just in time for the free guided tour of the Tower - it was a great way to learn the history of the tour - our guide brought his history to life - which was great for the kids!,A Step Back in Time
"July 9, 2016","A definite must while in London. English history starts here. Book on line. Audio guides a must. Arrive early and see the Crown Jewels first. The armory is fantastic but almost too much. The cafe serves very nice lunches, making an all day visit possible. We were at the Tower from 9:00 am to 2:30 pm, and saw about 80%. We skipped the torture chamber, so cannot comment on that. There were lots of activities for children, but as we were four adults, we did not join in. ",Tower of London and Beefeater Tour
"July 3, 2016","We got to the Tower shortly before 3 PM. We went to the Yeoman Warders Tour, aka Beefeaters tour. The Yeoman Warder that was our guide, Spike, was very knowledgeable, of course, and he managed to get the attention of about 200 people that was following him around. To see everything in the Tower, including the Crown Jewels, the White Tower, the Torture dungeon and more, 2.5 hours are not enough. Give yourself some more time, as the lines are almost as long as those for rides in Disneyland :-)","Must See, Best Attraction in London"
"June 23, 2016","My favourite attraction in London, though you have to get here early to be able to fully appreciate its beauty, history & space before the tourist groups arrive.My wife & I got here first thing in the morning when it was just opening (at 9am), and was able to enjoy the fresh air, the calmness around the tower and take some magnificent photos before it got extremely busy by around 10 - 10:30 am.Following some other travelers' advice, we went to see the Crown Jewels first before back-tracking to the start and visit the rest of the area, which we highly recommend as it allowed us the freedom and space to see the magnificent crown in peace without the touring crowds. It's unfortunate we weren't able to take photos inside but fully understand this given the value of the Crown Jewels on display. Seeing the security and the thick windows and doors just adds to the thrill of seeing the Crown Jewels, knowing you're looking at millions of dollars of history.After seeing the Crown Jewels, we then walked back towards the front entrance to join one of the free Yeoman Warder (Beefeater) tours which runs every 30 mins. We highly recommend this, as it was extremely enjoyable/entertaining and you get to learn a lot about the Tower of London as well as British history. The friendly banter the tour guide initiates just adds to the fun.After these 2 activities, which we highly recommend to do first, you can then roam freely around the Tower grounds and visit the various displays such as the Ravens, the Royal Beasts, the White Tower (armory), Torture Tower & the Wall Walk. On the Wall Walk, you can see amazing views of the Tower Bridge, the Gherkin and the surrounding areas. Throughout the day, there are also staged shows with actors recreating ancient events amongst the crowd, which was great fun.This is included with the London Pass, so we were able to walk straight in when we arrived.Highly recommended, and a must if you're visiting London.",Classic but crowded
"June 21, 2016","I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Tower of London.  The site was fascinating and historical.  The yeoman warder (beef eater) tour is a can't miss treat.  Spike did a fantastic job.  They are all military veterans!  Cafe food and prices were decent.  The line to see the Crown Jewels was about 45 minutes, so be prepared to que up and wait.  Otherwise a classic London attraction worth the time and expense.",Must See
"June 16, 2016","We really enjoyed the tour and the tour guide/Beef Eater Guard, Dave. Very nice intro to the historical site and then you are free to check out all the places within the site...which is more than one tower FYI. Dave did a nice job combining history and humor.Definitely worth checking out and give yourself a good 2 1/2 hours to have a thorough visit.",Must-do tourist visit in London
"June 12, 2016","The Tower of London is one of the most popular places to visit amongst all tourist attractions in the city.  Best planning is to get there early within the first 30 minutes of opening.  Very short lines at that time of day and much less congested compared to later in the day.  If you want to see the crown jewels, do that immediately upon your arrival in the tower.  Limited visitors early in the day will have you in and out of the crown jewel exhibition within 20 minutes so that you can circle back to the entrance gate and catch the next Yeoman guided tour.  (Be sure to note the frequency of the guided tours when you enter the tower so you know when the 'next tour' will be.)  Beyond the crown jewels, the second thing you want to do in the tower is take the Yeoman tour before crowds start to arrive by 11am.  If you explore some of the outer walls and rooms accessible to the public, plan 2-1/2 hours for your visit assuming you get there early before many others arrive.  Also, when exiting the tower, exit the side towards the Thames river as this will give you a view from the 'front' side along the river.",Beefeater Dave!
"June 5, 2016","Beefeater Dave's guided tour was the absolute best part of our visit to the Tower. His knowledge coupled with his sense of humor and quick wit made an incredibly fun hour. Besides that, seeing the Crown Jewels involved a long line and wait, but had interesting pictures to look at and things to read while waiting in the queue. The Tower is a must see for everyone visiting London.",A place I love
"June 3, 2016",breathing the history of the city. this is a place we visit many times a year (we're members of the English Heritage) because of the lovely sensation it gives. once inside you walk back in the ages. If you choose a weekday far from the weekend (and far from summer holidays) you can better appreciate these vibes. the crown jewels are just the icing on the cake,2 day trip to london
"May 25, 2016",A good attraction to visit in London for a reasonable price my wife and I paid £30 for us both to walk around the grounds and towers palaces ect it takes 2 to 3 hours worth going around with a beefeater Barney was quite amusing do wear comfy shoes try and visit mid week when it's not so busy,A Blast from the Past
"October 12, 2014","Followed tips by fellow TA advisors and got there when it opened.  If you do this, there is no need to buy skip the line or special passes.  We headed right for the crown jewels and were able to make a number of passes before it got crowded. After visiting the White Tower, we headed back out to the main gate for the Beefeater Tour.  Our guide was a retired army Sgt-Major who provided lots of interesting anecdotes with a humorous twist.  Allow about three hours to get a good feel for the place.",Poppies
"October 12, 2014",went today to see the First World War poppies installation .So very moving .What a fantastic experience 888246 beautiful ceramic red poppies free to view from outside the Tower of London .How ever had this idea deserves a medal  well done who ever you are  and thank you for this experience,Fantastic!
"October 11, 2014","My husband and I travelled to London today on an organised coach trip to the Tower of London... mainly because I wanted to see the Poppies.  We were so lucky that the sun shone all day apart from a short shower at lunchtime.  We hadn't been to the Tower for abouit 25 years so it was good to re-visit and see the (amazingly clean) historic buildings again.The highlight of course is the stunning display of ceramic poppies which can be seen without actually paying the admission fee to the Tower.  When the sun shone on the poppies they sparkled.It was tear-jerking to remember that each poppy represents someone who died in WWI, and inspiring to watch the many thousands of visitors taking pictures and paying their respect.",The poppys of remembrance - stunning and moving
"October 9, 2014","Wednesday 8th October, we made a rare visit to London, even though we live in Surbiton.  Once we had completed what needed doing we decided to visit some of the sights, one of the things we agreed we would like to visit was the Tower of London to see the poppys of remembrance. The display is know as Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red.The moat surrounding the Tower was full of the ceramic poppys, a sea of red, with some of the poppys down the wall of the Tower, almost like blood trickling down the wall into the sea below. It is so amazing, thought provoking,  emotional and a fitting tribute - 100 years World War 1. There are over 888,000 poppys representing the fallen.The poppys will be on display until 11th November,  so not there for much longer. This is so worth seeing. Congratulations to the Designers, Organisers and Planners of this poignant spectacle it is amazing.There is no fee to view the poppys.",Take the Beefeater tour ...
"September 3, 2014","The Tower of London for its historical value is probably a 3+ walk around ... but the Beefeater tour is hilarious, fun, and educational ... making the visit to Tower of London a 5 rating!",Horrible Histories bought to life!
"September 3, 2014","Had a Fab family day out here. We were going to go to Madame Tussaurds but were put off by the reviews about how busy it is at this time of year. We definitely made the right choice!We were lucky enough to get a tour from a Yeoman (Beefeater) called Mark, he was fantastic and bought all the grisly stories to life. Even our children were hanging off every word. The que for the crown jewels looked enormous, I joined the end which was down by the café at 2:30 by 2:55 we were inside the que was very fast moving so please don't be put off by the length of it.A great day out well worth the entrance fee (which is cheaper if bought online)The poppies are overwhelming they still have another 500,000 to lay. its very sobering when you think each one represents a life lost!",Poppies and the Last Post
"August 24, 2014","I strongly recommend trying to catch the planting of the Poppies in the Moat of the Tower of London. Equally Moving is the Last Post, where they are reading out some of the names of the Dead from world War One, from the middle of the field of poppies at sunset. The Poppies are amazing, since they are ceramic, one for each person who died during the war.This is only on until the end of the year.",Disappointing -- except for the Crown Jewels
"August 22, 2014","This was far and away the most disappointing attraction of anything we visited during our week's stay in London.  Price was a touch high -- and then, when you're through the gate -- we learn we have to pay AGAIN for an audio tour (which was, I think the only place we toured where this double-take was the case). To make matters worse, the audio is the most discombobulated.  Rather than have options for site 1, 2, etc. (which usually would be marked), as most tours did, this one apparently HAD to be done in order -- and woe to those (like us) who didn't want to see things in the order specified.   We finally just turned it off and walked around where we wanted to.   It seemed to us that they also wanted to avoid explaining the main thing the tower had been about -- i.e., a prison and place for some executions.   The only thing to spare this from being even more awful was the crown jewels.  They were truly exquisite.    The audio tour people need to take a page from Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace, both of which had EXCELLENT audio tours, with the price INCLUDED in the admission.  This desperately needs to be reworked.",Incredible display
"August 15, 2014",I went to Tower of London to see the WW1 poppy display in the moat. It is beautiful in a sad way . Am arranging to come back to London beginning November to see the completed display . My advice don't miss it . Go now go November but go its worth it,One of London's Well Kept Heritage
"August 10, 2014","Go early in the morning to avoid crowd and once you pass the main arch after the security check  , there is a clock that indicate the next tour conducted by a costumed Beefeater. My previous  tour with one of the Beefeater was hillarious and interesting. Unlike other attraction where audio guide is included with the entrance ticket, the audio guide here had to be paid for separately. Besides, the grim history of this fortress you will be able to see the ongoing exhibition of the Crown Jewel and Royal Armouries. Definitly a attraction that worth your time.",How to truly do the Tower.
"March 28, 2015","If you want to do the Tower of London, here is how you do it properly. Buy tickets on-line, This way when it opens at 10 am, you avoid the lines at ticket counter and walk straight onto the sight of the Tower. Make your way to the crown jewels right away. Once you have looked at the crown jewels come back to the entrance to find the next Beefeater giving a tour. These guys will take you around and give you loads of info about the history of their residence (yes, they live there!). After you have toured with the Beefeater, then walk around in the various buildings at your own pace. You will notice the line with an hour wait at the crown jewels and say to yourself ""thank goodness we did that first!"". You can also get a nice lunch on site but if you come out there are many restaurants right at the exit of the Tower. Enjoy!",Definitely go!  Here's how. 
"March 24, 2015","I don't do crowds or lines. So here's how to avoid them:  purchase your tickets ahead of time on-line, print out the email voucher that is sent to you and bring it with you on the day of the visit. Arrive just before they open. Go to the Group ticket line and pick up your tickets. Head inside the London Tower and go straight to the Jewels. See that first and then return toward the entrance for the Beefeater tour. Well worth it. Then simply enjoy the other parts of the Tower at your own pace. No better way to do it!",Fascinating Day
"February 18, 2015","We were fortunate to go to the Tower of London this August right after they had placed the poppies in memory of the 100 year anniversary of  WWI.  The tower is fascinating place, make sure you go on a Beefeater tour.   They are informative and entertaining.  It will take you most of the day to see everything and the line for the crown jewels looks long but moves along and it is worth the wait.",Such a let down for such a fantastic historical sight
"January 26, 2015","I am really interested in Tudor history, particularly Anne Boleyn so I was so excited to be going to the Tower of London to see for myself the place where so many amazing things happened in history. I was however really disappointed at the poor effort curation and research that I saw. The main 2 attractions are the Crown Jewels for which there was a 2 hr queue when we went so we skipped them as I was more interested in the history of the place than that part anyway, and the 2nd big event there is the exhibition of the great exhibition they have had there for 300 years. They put a lot of effort into an exhibition about this exhibition which was primarily wooden horses and armour from various monarchs. Instead of giving you information about the armour or the monarch who wore them you get lots of detail about the exhibition itself which is not nearly as interesting. Around the whole site there are 2 or 3 mentions of Anne Boleyn and her location when she was kept in the tower was not known. Most disappointing was the Bloody Tower for which we queued to get in and saw 3 boards with some vague information about the princes in the tower and a projection of a film from the 1970s about Richard III. I really wanted to go there and be able to imagine what it was like to have been kept there or to have stayed in the royal palace. I'd like to have learned something new and really felt the history in the place but instead I felt like things had been put together with minimum effort and barely any research. I was quite upset having been so looking forward to going and having paid so much for a ticket. Honestly you get as much from going and walking around the outside as you do from paying to get in. They need to hire new curators and make the history come to life as it is such a waste as it is. ",Excellent Guided Tour of the Tower
"November 10, 2014","We paid for a guided tour and a very jovial and friendly Yeoman Warder or ""Beefeater"" guided our group through the Tower.

"November 9, 2014","I cannot say enough about the impact the Sea of Poppies had on me.

I will return.,Some practical tips
"October 17, 2015","There's no point in repeating the endless accolades given to this attraction - everyone knows it's one of the star attractions of London. So given you're inevitably going to visit it, here's some helpful tips to get the most value out of your visit:* In the high season, if you don't arrive at the ticket booth by 9am, you'll never get ahead of the crowds & will be surrounded by crowds all day* The shoulder season isn't as bad (before June & after September) and you can get away with arriving at the ticket office at 9.45am ready for the beefeater tour at 10am, commencing from just inside the entrance gate.* Entrance fee is expensive but the clever thing to do if you are staying in London for 5 days or more is to purchase National Railway's (ie, the overground, NOT the underground) 7 day travel pass (good for all modes of public transport in London) which enables you to take advantage of their ""2 for 1"" offer at many attractions, one of which is the Tower. The pass gives good value on transport if you use it every day and for the featured attractions, lets in 2 pass holders for the price of 1 adult. Into the Tower, that's a saving of £22!* Do a beefeater tour upon arrival at the Tower, as it is an excellent overall introduction to both the history & layout of the Tower. Aim to arrive 15mins before the hour to take the tour on the hour.* If you can't arrive by 1pm, don't go that day as you won't have enough time to get full value out of your ticket. You need at least 4hrs to see the basics inside the Tower with a 30min break for lunch.* Don't go on a day forecast to rain as you will not get a comprehensive beefeater tour in the rain, and so miss out on the excellent introduction.* After the beefeater tour, find out from the information leaflet handed to you upon entry (or from one of the information booths) what other tours are on that day, pick the ones you want to target & plan your day around those times.* We picked & enjoyed: 1)the Anne Boylen tour (play actors acting out in the Tower grounds a small drama about the preparations for Anne's coronation as Queen, with actors in costume highlighting the popular resistance to the coronation)                       2) the White Tower tour which shows you the features of the central fortification (the tower), such as the royal toilet & the chapel at the top of the Tower* As there is only one cafe in the whole complex, it gets crowded after noon, so have an early lunch to save time, or pack a lunch to save both time & money.* Try to visit the Crown Jewels as early in the day as you can in order to beat the crowds* It is worth purchasing an audio guide to explain what you are seeing when not with a live guide. Be aware though that the audio guide does not narrate the Crown Jewels.* If you are short of time, based on our experience of a full day seeing everything, you can afford to skip the following:   1) The Fusieliers Museum - this is essentially a military museum highlighting small arms, uniforms & medals. All of these are of low interest compared to attractions elsewhere in the Tower.   2) The Torture Museum in the basement of the Bloody Tower is small & based on reproductions of equipment. If you've been to other displays of torture dungeons elsewhere in Europe, you can skip this.   3) Beauchamp Tower can be skipped as all it has of note is some fairly unintelligible grafiti carvings in walls done by prisoners over the years The must-do's are the Beefeater Tour (the only way you will be able to access before 4.30pm the Tower's Church where Boylen & other famous executed prisoners are buried), inside the White Tower, the Crown Jewels, and a walk around at least some of the turrets on the surrounding walls.IN SUMMARY, don't miss a thing by arriving early and planning your day there along the lines indicated above.(If you have found this review helpful, please indicate so by clicking the Helpful button)",Hilarious (and informative) Yeowman
"October 15, 2015",We took the Yeowman tour at around 11am and loved every minute of it! He was funny and very interactive! The lines moved pretty efficiently in the Crown Jewels exhibit. Will definitely visit again!,"If you can only do one thing in London, this is it"
"August 31, 2015","London is expensive, really, really expensive.  And I live in Sydney and it's not cheap here either so I am used to a high cost of living but London is on a whole other level!  So I recommend finding as many free or super cheap options if you are a tourist, like the Boris Bikes etc. and be really selective about where you go.  That's why I say if you can only do one thing in London then The Tower is a brilliant option.It is a stunning building with an incredible history.  It has been incredibly well preserved and it has been wonderfully well set out for tourists.  This is a place that children, teenagers and adults will all enjoy.  I was blown away by how well run it is and by the quality of the displays.  It must be a leader in its field internationally.  Do the free tours, set aside hours and see everything.  The restaurant inside was excellent (up market cafeteria).",Historical huge must
"August 25, 2015","Such a huge place it takes hours to go through it all, and then we skipped the Crown Jewels because the line was so long. We did join the tour with a Yeoman guard and that was great. Being interested in history this site is a must. ",We will never forget
"November 6, 2014","The Tower of London is great at any time but this year it's a bit special with nearly 900 thousand Poppy's in the moat to remember the fallen of the First World War, I took a 3 hour stroll around the Site to say it was beautiful  is an understatement but it made one think having found out our family lost two family members in the conflict.Get to see them before they go and they become a memory.",Worth it!
"October 31, 2014","We planed to spend half a day here-- and spent the whole day instead! There is just so much to see here. We started with a tour guided by one of the yeomen warders-- a great way to start. Then spent the rest of the day exploring the area on our own. We were lucky enough to visit during the art installation for the 100th anniversary of WWI, and the moat around the tower was full of ceramic poppies-- stunning.The Crown Jewels were, of course, amazing to see, but expect to wait in line for the chance. We only waited about 10-15 minutes to enter the exhibit, but I would imagine that wait is much longer in the summer.It seems there is something to see in every inch of the Tower of London. Oh, and the ravens were interesting too!There are several souvenir shops and little cafés around, so if you are feeling peckish or need retail therapy you can do that too.",Unmanaged crowds are dangerous
"October 31, 2014","My wife and I bought a £59 family ticket online to take our grandchildren (aged 8 and 5). The visit was an immense disappointment and actually quite dangerous.Crowd control and queue management was absolute disgrace. The difficulty began from arrival at Tower Hill tube station - not the Tower's responsibility I accept - and continued outside the Tower, with an immense crush of people milling around, many not knowing where they were going, pressing through queues, some jumping queues or inadvertently starting new queues, tripping over children and buggies, becoming angry etc. etc. Staff seemed entirely absent with the only advice coming from the service people selling poppies. It was quite frightening and any sort of incident would have produced injuries very quickly.If we hadn't already of paid for our ticket we would have gone home right away.We did eventually manage to get into the Tower and found movement inside almost as difficult. There were extremely long queues for everything (including the cafe, the Crown Jewels and the Armoury), crushes in the Bloody Tower, Medieval Palace and the wall walk. Once again the very long queues were completely mismanaged with people having difficulty passing through them to get anywhere, people arguing and finding they'd been standing in the wrong queue and tension very high. Once again, the situation was extremely dangerous; especially so for children.The Yeoman Warder tours and talks - which I have found added an exciting feature in the past - were simply impossible to hear due to the crowds. It became clear that we were not going to be able to queue safely for that length of time with the children and after visiting the toilets (which were thankfully OK) and the shop to spend about £30 on souvenirs, we went home; once again negotiating dangerous and unmanaged crowds on the way out..The Tower of London has always been important to me. My father took me there in the 1950s and I took my children there in the 1980s. It is part of my history and heritage. Visiting inspired me to read and study history and politics. Yesterday's visit was an immense and expensive, dangerous and upsetting disappointment.I understand that it was Poppy Day and that the poppies in the moat have become a tourist attraction in themselves (we could hardly glimpse them) but it is plain that there is going to be a serious tragedy at the Tower of London unless the crowds are brought under control. A serious warning on the website might be advised but there is nothing.My sad conclusion is that you should avoid visiting the Tower of London unless you go in 1957",Poppies
"October 23, 2014",I went to the tower just to see the poppies I was not disappointed The display is absolutely magnificent and well worth a trip just to see it It was very very busy but the number of people viewing the poppies only added to the enormity of the art work It was very moving. We didn't go into the tower itself but even so we spent a good two hours just walking around the moat looking at the poppies. I highly recommend this,Sea of Poppies Blood Swept and Tears
"October 21, 2014",Very privileged to be part of the voluntary team on Saturday that planted the Ceramic Poppies It was wonderful to see all the visitors showing such an interest Having viewed the Poppies from above with all the spectators it really is breathtaking Please go and see this at the Tower of London then stay for the last post as the roll of honour is read out .... Very moving What a wonderful tribute .......,Tower of London
"October 20, 2014","My wife & I used Tesco vouchers on Friday 17th October worth £30 so only had to pay another £10 to get in. Almost immediately we got inside at around 11am, a good crowd had gathered and were laughing away as Beefeater MARK, I believe, (pics to follow) was beginning his entertaining and amusing walking tour of the Tower. The Byward Tower was first and then the Bell Tower and Traitors Gate. Mark constantly kept the crowd informed, spellbound and laughing with his special brand of storytelling. St Thomas's Tower followed and then the awful story of the Princes in the Blood Tower. Now were outside The Chapel of St Peter & Vincula, where Mark pointed out a nearby spot where amongst others, Anne Boleyn had lost her life in a beheading. Inside we went and it was very solemn (no cameras/pics/phones) as Mark very movingly told the story of the death of Anne Boleyn (a tear ran down my face) - 3 queens of England, Anne B, Catherine Howard and Jane Grey, and two saints of the Roman Catholic Church, Sir Thomas More and John Fisher, are also buried here. Here the tour ended on a higher note with applause and smiling faces as we exited the Chapel. So much more to see, including the Crown Jewels in a new setting created in 2012 by De Beers, The Armoury including Henry the 8th body and horse armour (note the H&K for Katherine on his armour skirt (see pic). We were lucky to have also seen the amazing Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red in which teams of volunteers are installing 888, 246 handmade poppies to mark the death of each member of the British Forces in the 1st World War. 5 hours very well spent absorbing 800 odd years of history. Admittedly not very user friendly for wheelchair users or buggies due to the age and sheer volume of stairs in the Tower.",Gorgeous Poppies
"October 18, 2014","Hurry quick to see the gorgeous red poppies outside commemorating almost 900,000 military deaths in WWI.  It is beautiful. The crown jewels were the best part - simply amazing.  Could easily spend the entire day here with so much history to soak in.",poppy display
"October 18, 2014","Excellent, don't need to pay to see it. Plenty of room to enjoy the view. Walked along the embankment to get there which was lovely.",Sea of Poppies - so moving.
"October 18, 2014","The sea of poppies at The Tower of London are amazing. We went at 17.45. We saw all the poppies and then at about 18. 10 a beefeater and a guardsman marched to the mound. The beefeater solemnly read out the names and ranks of quite a few of the men who gave their lives for king and country during World War One. After this the guard played The Last Post. Every one stood in silence as a show of respect - so moving. The whole thing made me weepy at the thought of such a loss of so many young men and women, and that was just from Britain and the Commonwealth. How anymore thousands from around the world died and how many more suffered for the rest of their lives?",Poppies!
"October 17, 2014","If you're in London until November, don't miss a trip to the Tower to view the ceramic poppies commemorating WWI.  There is  a poppy for every British soldier killed during WWI.  It's a breathtaking, but sobering sight to behold.  You don't need a ticket to view the poppies.  ",Poppies
"August 9, 2014",We only went to see the Poppies and didn't go into the Tower of London. You do not have to pay to see the PoppiesThe sight of the Poppies is incredibly moving and even now is quite a sight. It will be breathtaking by the time they have finished. The last poppy will be placed on Armistice Day.The volunteers are assembling the Poppies on sight and each of the volunteers has a link to the First World War. A lot of the foreign tourists were more concerned with taking selfies and didn't appear to stop and think about the poignancy of it all.Link for the page ,Going to the Tower of London ruined our holiday
"July 27, 2014","We went with the best of intentions. Had been to Windsor Castle the day before for a lovely day but ended up in the 'Gaoler of Towers' office having a hot sweet drink  for an hour after being verbally attacked and abused but one of the Yeomen.Alarm bells started ringing at the beginning of the tour when he made many offensive comments.  He really didn't seem to like women very much,  other nationalities had snyde comments,  and he seemed to be more preoccupied with the self promition of his after dinner speaking than the job he was actually in uniform to do. He was giving the impression that there were issues. The pace of the tour was unbelievable. After a very strange tour my son asked if he could have a picture with him, as you would expect that many tourists would ask. The man went into a  complete meltdown and started screaming about two inches from the face of my child. Ranting and screaming that he wasnt mickey mouse amongst other things and that he was a soldier. He had complete and utter hatred on his face. Without being melodramatic, it was traumatising and it has a surprising affect on you, especially when you werent able to protect your child from such a person. I don't upset easily but we was so upset I ended up sobbing to another Yeoman, he was luckily was a real gentleman. Later it didnt take me long in finding reference to the bad man as my son calls him on the Internet and on You Tube for his offensive comments. (Yeoman warden) Given that they have ""Investors in people"" status I would question the decision to allow this man access to the public, or awarding the status in the first place as clearly this has been going on for a while. . It does not appear to be a one - off.Even though I made a complaint to the Historic palaces I have heard nothing since. That is how much they invest in people. Far too full in August.... crammed!",Arguably London's best attraction but ticket sales are dreadful
"July 22, 2014","The Tower is one of my favourite places we visited during our stay in the UK. The buildings are largely intact, with William the Conqueror's White Tower amazingly unchanged since it was built in 1078. There's plenty to see, but you shouldn't miss the tours run by the yeoman warders - these guys are not just knowledgeable, they're very entertaining too, and they really make history come alive. There's no extra cost to join one of the tours, so be sure to do it.There's a fairly impressive display of armour and weapons in the White Tower, but having recently been in Paris and seen the massive collection at Les Invalides, we were not all that interested in more of the same. I did stop to admire a number of things, including Henry VIII's lance and the various suits of armour that belonged to him though. The Crown Jewels are the big drawcard here and really are spectacular. The size of the stones in the Queen's crown have to be seen to be believed. You do need to plan your visit fairly carefully. We arrived before the gates opened and once we were in, headed straight for the Jewel House, where the crown jewels are held. There was no queue to get in at that point, but progress through the rooms was still quite slow. By the time we came out, there was a long queue, snaking back and forth at the entrance.Once we'd finished there, we headed back to the main entrance and joined a tour. That was one of the most entertaining hours we spent in the UK. Following the tour, we took our time going through the White Tower and the Medieval Palace. We had planned to visit the Bloody Tower next, but by this time there was a crowd waiting to get in and we'd been there a few hours, so we decided to skip it.A thoroughly enjoyable visit.Now for the negative: The ticket sales system is chaotic and not explained properly on the website. I bought our tickets online the night before our visit. The email confirmation I received stated that I needed to print it and bring it to the group ticket window to obtain my tickets. There was nothing mentioned about printing anything at any point in the booking process prior to this and I was annoyed, as we had no access to a computer or printer, only having a phone and ipad. There was no information about what time the ticket office opened, so we arrived an hour prior to the Tower opening time in the hope that we could get our tickets early. No such luck. The Tower opened at 10:00am on Mondays and so did the ticket sales windows. We had breakfast and went back at 9:30 to wait. By then, there was a long queue at the individual ticket sales windows, another queue of people (who already had their tickets) building at the entrance and a short queue of people like me who'd booked online at the group sales window. A staff member appeared and informed those in my queue who had printed copies of their emails that they could just go and join the entrance queue - no need to get tickets, the email would do. This is contrary to what the email says - why not say that in the email? They have no provision for scanning barcodes on mobile devices though, so I still had to wait. Also, if you've booked tickets for multiple sites (e.g. for the Tower and for Hampton Court Palace), you still have to wait in line.The ticket sales offices opened at the same time as the gates, so I had my husband join the queue to get in, thinking that the queue of ten people in front of me would move quickly. Nope. By the time I got to the window, the people who HADN'T booked online already had their tickets and were halfway to the gate. Ridiculous.By the time I got our tickets, everyone who'd arrived without pre-booking was already inside, so it was a completely pointless exercise to have bothered booking online - oh, except that I saved 2 pounds.My advice is to book online well in advance of your visit (to save a bit of money) and make sure you can either print the email, or call at the group ticket window on a prior day to your visit to collect your tickets.",An amazing must see in London!
"June 8, 2014","The Tower of London is an amazing site to see in London but you'll need probably 3-4 hours at least to see it all.  It cost £22.00 for an adult but you can get discounts by purchasing through their website ahead of time. We bought the London Pass (a definite savings if you plan to see the major tourist sites in London).  The Tower of London is included in the London Pass AND gives you a Fast Track option so you can bypass the long ticket lines.BIG TIP:  The Tower of London opens at 9:00am...go early!  You want to be there early as this is a popular site to see and does get extremely crowded.  Once you are in, go straight back to see the Crown Jewels exhibit (no photography allowed in the Jewels building).  The lines for this get extremely long as the day progresses so go early and go straight to see these first.  There are numerous buildings towers and museums to tour.TIP:  A  must do is to take the guided tour with a Yeoman Warder (aka Beefeater)...incredibly interesting and some of them are extremely hilarious!  Tours run every 30 minutes and last for about an hour.  You'll find the starting/gathering point for the tour near the entrance to the Tower of London, just follow the signs.  You'll want to skip doing this first though as you'll want to see the Crown Jewels first before the crowds increase.TIP:  Wear comfortable shoes (preferably rubber soles).  Some of the buildings/towers involve VERY narrow and skinny spiral stairwells up and down.  If you have mobility issues you will be limited in access to some areas unfortunately.  The Tower of London hold a 1000 years of history.  It's been used as a place of executiion, prison, armory, mint and museum.  Go early and give yourself plenty of time to enjoy this amazing area of history.",Tower of London
"May 14, 2014","The tower is very old, started by William the Conqueror in the 1080's next to an old Roman wall.  There are actually 21 different towers with lots of different displays.  The display of armor was extensive and very interesting with very good descriptions.  The most popular exhibit is the Crown Jewels.  The crowd control was pretty good and not too obtrusive.  To see the crown jewels, you are sent through a number of rooms with interesting information to regulate the flow.  The room with the major exhibit uses people movers next to the crowns so everyone gets to see up close and no one can block other people.  You are able to go around and go by as many times as you can.  At noon, it was easy.  At 3, when I was trying to cut through during a rain shower, it was mobbed with a huge tour of French school children.  It is the luck of the draw.All the exhibits were well done with clear explanations.  I skipped the torture chamber.  The exhibit about the menagerie included great sound effects and interesting statues, as well as what happened to them (they were eventually sent to the London Zoo).Throughout the tower, were exhibits on earlier visitors to the Tower and their responses to what they saw, along with drawings or old photographs to show what the exhibits looked like then.There is a cafeteria, with mediocre food at high prices.  I had the 9 GBP for lamb tagine with vegetables and cous cous and a cup of tea  (10.65 GPB), that was mostly sauce, gristly lamb and very few vegetables - and too sweet.  This par for the course for major tourist attractions - similar to Disneyland.This is definitely a worthwhile place to see once but probably not twice.",History Revealed
"March 31, 2014","If you are visiting London then the Tower of London is an absolute must. I have been twice and was simply overawed by the history that is captured here. everything from the Crown Jewels to the Towers themselves. The story of the Ravens and visiting the Chapel where Anne Boylen and other famous traitors and Wives of Henry VIII are buried. If you visit plan to spend at least a half day (we ended up spending all day!).Some hot tips:1.Do the Beefeater tour, As well as being very informative and entertaining it will also get you access to the Chapel.2. Get a London Pass/Travel Card. This gets you free access to a lot of sight seeing destinations in London or at a reduced cost and lets you skip a lot of queue's.",What a castle ought to be
"March 29, 2014","I'm a New York City tour guide on vacation in London. The Tower of London is a beautiful castle built by the Norman conquerors and their descendants to control trade on the River Thames and intimidate the local population of London. The Tower is located on the north bank of the Thames at the southeasterly corner of the City of London (the original old walled city). When you come out of the Underground at Tower Station on the Circle Line (yellow) there is a portion of the 2000 year old Roman wall still standing. There is also a DLR Terminal called Tower Gate a couple blocks away. Another exciting way of arriving or departing is by Thames Clipper River Bus at Millennium Pier a few steps from the Tower. I used the boat to get to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich after my Tower visit. Getting into the tower is £22 for adults including a small contribution. You can save a couple pounds online. The audio guide is another £3 and that is purchased once you enter the a Tower on the right. Come early! It opens at 9:00 AM. Select 4 on the audio guide and proceed directly to the Crown Jewels. High school students from Britain and the Continent will invade shortly en masse. Once you have seen the jewels (no photos) take your time and go back to select 1 on your guide and enjoy the rest of the Tower. If you need a restroom use them now before the aforementioned classes begin to. There are many helpful employees at the Tower. One explained to me the duties of the Royal Jeweler because all of the jewels, crowns, scepters, orbs, and plate travel to state occasions and royal family events. I learned about the mace. Parliament cannot conduct business without the mace present because it represents the royal authority so there are maces kept in both Houses of Parliament. When the Queen visits to open Parliament and she walks into the House of Lords they politely cover their mace laying on a table in a velvet cloth because the Queen, the royal authority, is present in person. As the man explained to me, ""This is what makes us British."" Don't forget to take pictures of the Tower Bridge framed by the windows inside the medieval turrets.",Great history lesson
"October 15, 2013",We visited London from the U.S. in May. We walked down the south side of the Thames in early afternoon with a refresher stop at the Oxbow before going across the Tower bridge for a tour of the Tower of London. It was well worth the walk and the price of admission. The Beefeater guide (these fellas are actual military personnel who guard the premises including the Crown Jewels) was both witty and very informative on the long history of the tower and it's famous residents. The tower itself is amazingly constructed and preserved. Don't pass up the armory across from the Crown Jewels repository. We did take a black cab back to our hotel (St. Ermin's) The driver was very friendly as we found most in London and gave a great tour on the way back. A great day overall. PS we walked by the Wheel but chose not to ride as it seemed a bit pricey and was crowded.,Go early or dont go at all
"August 25, 2013",We went early (8am) and location opened at 9am.  Got tickets and went inside and within the hour it was hard to move around and enjoy the sites.  The crown jewels exhibit was very impressive.  The views near the waterfront are very nice.,Go early and stay long
"June 22, 2013","Warning - this place can get really crowded as the day goes by.  We went first thing one morning and didn't wait in a single line - anywhere.  And this was in June.  So that early morning thing really works!  Anyway, we thought the entire complex was fascinating and we spent four hours exploring - a one hour tour with a Beefeater (I do agree with some other posters that they ought to increase their ratio of Beefeaters to visitors) who was charming and interesting, and then three hours of wandering and poking about.  The Crown Jewels were worth seeing, though I wouldn't have waited in a long queue to do so - I mean, they were interesting but there are more interesting things to do there than wait in a long line.   I would recommend that you read up on Tower history before visiting - you will know more about what you're looking at as you wander around, and I do recommend wandering after you go on a Beefeater tour.  I probably won't visit the Tower again, but it was well worth the time and effort to see.",Overpriced and disappointing
"February 21, 2013","I have to agree with the minority who find the Tower very disappointing. Of course there are some interesting things, and one rather lovely one (St John's Chapel) but I've tried twice to enjoy visits there, failed, and at £20.90 per adult I won't be trying again. It is, in concentrated form, what we've done to the more prestigious of our ancient sites and towns: touristify them to the maximum, promote them relentlessly and watch the crowds roll in despite extortionate charges. While Windsor Castle is still quite enjoyable, and Hampton Court very much so, the Tower has just let its mass-tourist agenda go too far. Good business, no doubt, but I just find it sadly unsatisfying; you can package things so far that even what is real feels fake.",A good day out!!
"October 25, 2012",My husband and I went to Tower of London and thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  It is advisable to take a picnic lunch with you tho as the eating places inside are busy and expensive.  This is not a cheap visit so be prepared to spend at least 3 - 4 hours looking at everything.  Nice photo opportunities of the Queens Guards and also the Crown Jewels is something to see.,A Day at the tower
"October 12, 2012","This was my first visit to this attraction, and what great value for money, the guided tour with a ""Beefeater"" was very informative and very interesting, learning serveral things we, as children were never taught in school.Time just flew, and before we knew it, the whole day had passed, and with the added bonus of NO queueing anywhere, very well organised, and to see the crown jewels was truly breathtaking.  Excellant day !",Queens Keys
"August 25, 2012",Did you know you can book an exclusive invite to the Queens keys ceremony.This is a must do! Go to Tower of London website for info.,In need of a re-think.
"August 19, 2012","My wife and I have been to London many times but for some reason, never to “The Tower”. We had just been to Spain where we had visited numerous beautiful and impressive historic sites and decided we would like to see the Crown Jewels. For some reason we imagined the Jewels were in “The White Tower” and there would be a few other displays of historic interest. Wrong! The first inkling of this was when confronted with the entrance fee, 19 pounds plus voluntary donation. Then the map of the grounds with its extensive walls, many towers and their respective rooms. We waited for one of the Yeoman guides as this seemed like an entertaining way of learning about the history of the place. At first the jovial humour of the costumed guide amused me, although my wife and her English cousin found all the murderous joking cringe worthy. However by the third stop, when he started going on like some archaic comedic cliché about the nationalities of our group and less about the history, I was ready to leave the group too. This was not a good start! There seemed to be other guides in fancy dress walking around with groups but we never got to make a comparison with this guide. We soon discovered the Crown Jewels are not in The White Tower and we joined the long queue to see them. The winding passage was lined with  large colourful back lit images  relating to royalty but personally I found them out of keeping stylistically and largely uninteresting and uninformative. The Jewels themselves were another matter and were astonishing and fascinating… but I could not really say beautiful. We then moved on to the White Tower which is apparently largely built with light coloured imported French stone, although the guide book barely acknowledges this interesting fact. The display of armour in the tower museum was mildly interesting, as was the weaponry and other devices of torture and death, but it is a little sad that the most interesting item on display was probably fat old King Henry VIIIth’s  cod piece! Seemingly, a dying old man’s attempt at a power statement in the face of  his failing health, or possibly a medical necessity because of his STD,  it has been argued. There were many other lesser towers to visit but perhaps the most interesting for me was about the Tower of London’s history as a zoo. Astonishing for us today.  My overall impression though, was that The Tower of London needs a make-over. The curators need to make up their mind what they are trying to present. Right now as a historical site, it lacks a sense of cohesiveness, and even a sense of dignity that many of the historic sites we visited in Spain displayed. It is certainly not beautiful in the way that they are but does have a history which could be presented better. I feel it struggles to entertain without sufficient real content to hold our interest. The expensive admission fee could help buy this. I would be pleased to act as a consultant! (Smile)",Best London attraction for the money
"June 15, 2012","The Tower of London (a castle, really, with a large white tower in it's center) is a great two to three hour visit to examine London's history mostly from the 15th to 17th centuries. While it is one of the more expensive sites to visit (20 pounds per person), it is likely one of the best to spend on. From the Thames it looks somewhat smaller than it really is. When exiting the Tube at Tower Hill, proceed through the underpass that faces the castle walls, then walk right about 100 meters, and you'll reach the ticketing courtyard. All in all expect about 300 meters from the Tube to actual entry over a lightly sloping concourse. Some notes for consideration:- You may purchase your tickets online and then pick them up at the group sales window, which is separate and to the left of the general purchase windows. You will save two pounds per ticket and likely avoid longer queues. There is no need to print out your ticket information, just provide the counter clerk with your order number. Tickets are valid for single entry up to seven days from purchase.- You may wish to walk around the inner walls of the castle before heading to the center courtyard to see the white tower itself. Just after you pass the ticket gate, there are a set of stairs to your right which allow you to get onto the inner walls. Follow the walls all around the castle and you will go into nice exhibits at every tower you come across, eventually reaching the crown jewels which are on exhibit during the Summer of 2012. Note that once you get on the inner walls it may be difficult to get back down as there are no open exits until you almost walk them all the way through.- There is a small outdoor cafe on the premises (Raven's Kiosk) that sells sandwiches and traditional pasties. It's sort of built into a wall cavity in one of the corners next to the souvenir shop. The food is acceptable and somewhat economical if you are in a hurry to get a bite to eat and move on (four to five pounds for a panini or pasty, one to two pounds for a soda). There is also a restaurant available if you'd like indoor seating, more variety, and higher prices.- Just in case you were expecting otherwise, the royal beasts exhibit is not a real animal exhibit. It shows, mostly through drawings and projections, the types of animals that were housed on premises at earlier times. Good mostly for small children.- Dedicate around two hours to see everything on your own. Add another 45 minutes if you want to tour around with one of the yeoman tours. These tours are quite fun and informative, but can get very crowded, and since the voice of each yeoman only carries so far you'll need to be near the front of each tour to truly benefit from it.- Although it is an outdoor attraction, the premises do allow for viewing even under rainy conditions as most of what you see is either inside the main (white) tower or in one of the other towers around the inner wall perimeter.A great attraction overall for any age.",Tower of London - tips and review
"April 25, 2012","Loved the Tower - but haven't seen a lot of reviews that give any tips....Took the District (Green) Tube line to Tower Hill station stop. Very easy. ** TIP for tickets: go out of the station, turn left and go back down the other stairs as if you're going back into the station entrance - there is a little gift shop at the bottom right of the stairs - ""The Tower Gate"" that sells tickets for the Tower of London. BUY here & save yourself the big queue at the site. It's a short 5 minute walk to the site - and a few gift shops and cafes around as you go. TIP: you get a great view of Tower Bridge as you get close to the entrance gate. Take some pics and you can also get some great pics of the Tower Bridge inside of the Tower of London site. Tip: As some have said - plan to get there at opening. Then do yourself a favor and DO go see the Crown Jewels display FIRST. Go in the gate, down a bit and at the first ""real"" left you can make go into/ cross the courtyard and into the largest building at the far end - pretty well labeled. Crown Jewels has some great displays first (films, swords, etc) and then into the ""main room"" where you can go on a conveyor belt on either side of the main Crown Jewels OR you can also walk up & stand/ stare at them from a slightly elevated platform behind the conveyor belt. You can go back around and do the conveyor again - we did to enjoy all the majesty of the jewels. Then some great displays on the Coronation Banquet  pieces and some great armour, etc. Take your time to walk around & explore all the towers, walls, grounds & embankments - there is a LOT to do. NOTE: there are a lot of stairs, a lot of them very narrow and shallow - so take care if you have mobility issues. Great insight & displays and ""self taught"" lessons on the history, torture, animals, etc of the Tower along the way. Again, lots of stairs. Be prepared. Also - about 11 am the tour groups and school groups start pouring in - be prepared for large crowds, who seem to like to stop and talk in doorways (why! move over!) and walk in front of your pictures. Enjoy the sites & pageantry of the Fusiliers who are on guard - and there is a great military exhibit/ museum in the building across from the White Tower. Stop in the White Tower for a great look at history, armour & kings across the ages. The Yeoman/ Beefeater tours are every 30 minutes - but they are back up at the very front of the site - right after the entrance gate. Amazing stories and history! Not including the Yeoman tour - we took over 3 hours to walk around - and that was in the freezing rain. If it was nicer, we could have taken longer.",London Tower Twilight Tour - A MUST
"February 28, 2012","These limited space, often sold-out twilight (7pm) tour of the London Tower was fantastic! They run only Wednesdays in the winter through March. The Yeoman Warders provide a hilarious, spooky tour through the palace at night that's beautiful, insightful and fun -even if there's alight rain. Our Yeoman had lots of personality and knowledge about the history and ghoulish events at the Tower. A must if you are available on one of those Wednesdays. We happened to get our ticket through eBay before we left, otherwise, it was sold out. Go an hour early to see the Crown Jewels first as they are not in the tour (closed behind a vault safe at that time of nigh).",Family vacation
"January 6, 2012",A must see to understand whom and what London is... as well as London Bridge!,MUST SEE IN YOUR LIFETIME
"September 12, 2011",WOW. Wish we'd planned an entire day for this excursion. The Crown Jewels are here as well as the infamous Bloody Tower. You really feel as though you've stepped back in time. Fascinating place. Enormous too. Be prepared for a lot of pictures and walking.,spent 4hours there and still didn't see everything
"September 12, 2011","We had bought tickets online in advance. There wasn't much of a line to get tickets or get in but it was nice to have a backup incase it was busy. We were able to take the tube directly to the tower as there is a 'tower' stop right across the street.  Checkout the old roman wall outside the subway station and another excavation on the pedestrian walk way on the way to the tower. There was a yeoman tour guide ahead of us so we joined that group instead of waiting 20mins for the next one. Our guide was humorous and informative. He led us into the inside of the keep and ended at the chapel. No pictures in the chapel, but make sure to check out the tomb markers at the front alter where Lady Jane Grey is as well as some other notables. The Normal 'white castle' was fun to see, it had large exhibits in the main rooms and smaller views of every day life in others. If you are claustrophobic some of the winding stairs and hall ways can be tight, but it's worth a look around. We visited the crown jewels right around lunch time so the line was shorter and moved quickly. I was surprised that there's a moving sidewalk to get you by the crown jewels, but i guess they don't want people looking too long and clogging up the cue. Beautiful stuff, not a very long exhibit but worth a look. we had lunch in the Tower Cafe. they had a good variety of pre-made sandwiches and chips as well as some really good baked goods, hot plate options like fish n chips and brisket. Make sure to pick up a raspberry tart, it was about the best thing i'd had all week, my husband had the Victoria cake and he said he wished he had gotten my tart. We exited on the river side where there are fantastic views of the Tower Bridge (aka: London bridge). Great opportunity to walk over and take a closer look. well worth the time, i didn't expect to be there more than 2hours but we were there for about 4hrs, so give yourself lots of time.",Fun Times at the Tower
"September 3, 2011","We went to the Tower of London--- it was crowded but SO FUN and INTERESTING. Take the time to do the tour with one of the ""Beefeaters"" (Yeoman Warders). Ours was so informative and FUNNY. Doesn't matter how large the group is; these fellows can really belt out the information (you almost feel the need to stand at attention out of respect). We viewed the Crown Jewels, toured the central White Tower, took a break at the cafe (which BTW, was managed VERY PROFESSIONALLY), took a walk around the outer wall, and viewed the Fusilier Museum.... we didn't intend to, but we spent 5 HOURS at the Tower! GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!",Awesome Place to Visit
"August 26, 2011","My wife and I visite the Tower of London in March of 2011.  I have been before during the Christmas season and it was much more crowded.  The weather wasnt great, but March is probably the best time to go because there aren't nearly as many tourists as there would be in the summer.  Make sure you take the guided tour that is free and given by one of the Yeomen.  They know just about everything there is to know about the Tower and you'll learn things you would otherwise miss by going around on your own.",Super interesting
"August 26, 2011","The Tower was very interesting. Although the guided tours were that large that you couldn't really hear the guides. I  bought a book about the tower, so that we could tour it by ourselves and read the information.We didn't make it to the jewelry room, because we were heading to a concert in the evening. I would recomend to go to the jewelry room first thing in the morning, because the lines build up true the day.I really enjoyed the tour, and would take it again, on my next visit. There is alot of things to see that have to do with the Tudors. I watch the show Tudors on TV, so I found it particularly interting to know about that epoche. Everybody who saw the show can easily understand what happened there. It was amazing to see all those rooms where those kings really lived. And the armour collecting is really great. They even have childrens armours, which I didn't even knew existed.",Arrive early and see Crown Jewels first
"August 25, 2011",The key to a great visit to the Tower of London is to arrive early and see the Crown Jewels before the crowds get too large.We went in early August on a Saturday. I had pre-booked tickets the night before on line to save a few pounds. I planned to arrive at 9AM but we didn't get there until 10AM. The crowds actually were not as bad as I expected. However by lunch time it was packed.,Tower of London - and other sites - on the cheap
"July 29, 2011","Went to the Tower Area yesterday with grandson via C2C rail line from Essex. Train line goes via Fenchurch street to Essex coast. Went online to C2C and as long as you can show 2 train tickets you can get a raft of 2 for 1 entrance offers to the Tower and lots and lots of top London Attractions. I bought tickets from LimeHouse to Fenchurch Street only (1 stop). I got a cheap ticket for me and only paid £1 for grandson's off peak child which saved a LOT of entrance money on our visit to the Tower and Churchill's WW2 Museum at London Bridge.The other cheapo tip I have for visiting the Tower is to NOT go inside if you have a large group. It is VERY expensive for a family to visit (2011 prices adult £19.80, child £10.85) and unless you are mad keen to see where people's heads got chopped off you may not think it's worth the entrance. ALL of the Royal Armaments from the Tower are no longer there but are in Leeds (a VERY long way from London). Also all we saw of the Crown Jewels were pictures and videos. Just walk around the perimeter, take as many photos as you can of the outside walls including gates where the Beefeaters stand. Believe me, most people will never know from your photo's you have NOT been inside the walls. Also in the summer months, there are usually Jousts held in the old moat area on the outside of the walls. These also are free to watch and take pictures of.",Excellent Slice of History!
"June 22, 2011","What a treat to see the Ceremony of the Keys last December! Every night for at least 700 years, the ceremony has taken place at exactly 9:53 PM. Tickets are free, but you must request them in advance by post. A word of warning, however - the ceremony is indeed carried out my members of the Tower of London Guard and they do not suffer fools. You will be escorted out if you can't keep from yapping! Witnessing the Tower lock-up is a fantastic way to end a day of London sightseeing and I couldn't recommend it more highly!",Great way to know British history
"June 12, 2011","First thing: book tickets online; that entitles you to a discount.  Also, a ticket is valid for 1 week from the date mentioned.  So if you have to make your own itinerary, this flexiticket is a boon.  Instead of taking a bus tour of London or a hop off hop on tour, you can save money by doing a free walking tour of London and using a traval card/oyster card get down at Tower Hill tube station and make your way to the Welcome Centre to get the ticket vouchers in exchange of your online tickets.  It is best to come early morning when most tourists are at the Buckingham Palace to see the Change of Guards (1130 hours).  You can avail of the Yeoman's Warder tour which gives you a hang of the Tower and all the history and gore associated with it.  You should then make your way to see the Crown Jewels.  If you have the energy, you can then see the White Tower (if you are interested in the various armours and weapons used by the royals of yore) and the Medieval Palace and take a walk along the walls of the Tower.  It can take up to 4-5 hours if you really want to see the Tower in detail; if you are short of time, take the Yeoman Warder tour followed by a visit to the Crown Jewels followed by a walk along the walls of the Tower.  This attraction is a must see if you are in London",The must-see attraction in London
"May 19, 2011","When in London, you must stop and spend a half day at the Tower of London, it will be well worth it. Just after getting in, there are free tours leaving from the entrance led by a Yeoman Warder that take 1 hour and give you a good idea of the history of the Tower. These guides are humourous and knowledgable so take advantage of that.There is a lot to see, the crown jewels are amazing although the line to get to see them can be very long. On a Friday late morning, it wasn't too long.  The Tower itself has a lot to see inside but there a lot of stairs to climb both up and down so it can be tiring. There is a large gift shop in the basement of the tower. The walk aloong the walls has some great views of London. I recommend the cafetria for lunch, wasn't that expensive and had a good selection. The only thing that disappointed was the torture chamber as nothing really to see in there. My kids were rather disappointed in that part. A tip is to buy your tickets online and then pick them up at the ticket office. A family pass was a great deal and reduced to 47 pounds when buying it online.",A fun and historically interesting afternoon
"March 24, 2011","The thing that struck me the most about the Tower of London is the overwhelming sense of history that it exudes.  For me it wasn't the crown jewels or even the beefeaters (or Yeoman Warders to be correct :-) that created a connection to the past but the architecture itself.  There really is something special about touching stonework that was completed on the orders of William I.  Certainly worth a visit for anyone interested in British history.I would however recommend not going during 'peak times'.  I went at lunch time on a Saturday and some of the ques were pretty long.  I'd recommend either going in the morning before the coaches of tourists arrive or later on in the afternoon, although I should point out the last Yeoman Warder tour is at 3.30pm.",Go to the Tower!
"November 1, 2008",We visisted the tower last Thursday and had a thoroughly enjoyable day.  We booked tickets online with 365 and saved a few pounds.  My tip would be to go straight to the Crown Jewels exhibit.  We went at 10 am and the queue was minimal.  By the afternoon it was huge (even in October).  Then we went back to join a yeoman guard tour.  Our guide was Mark and it was very informative as well as hilarious at times.  Not to be missed!,great attraction for learning English history
"October 18, 2008","My husband and I thought the Tower of London was great. It is actually several buildings all surrounded by a large moat in the middle of London, surrounded by modern town and on the river Thames. It contains the old ""White Tower"" which is where most kings and rulers lived, including Henry VIII, the spot of the beheadings of various people, including Anne Boleyn, the treasury of England, where you get to see the crown jewels of England, and other buildings that I'm not sure what they were. I must say that the crown jewels are a MUST SEE! They are awesome, the only way to describe them. The tower has the dungeon where they tortured some, you can see the Traitor's gate, where they brought Anne B. through in a boat, and you can have a guided tour there by a beefeater (in uniform) who will explain everything. I thought the raven story was interesting and there are still quite a few there. All in all, it was very interesting and the crown jewels makes it worth seeing at least once.",Wow---The Crown Jewels!
"September 17, 2008",Take the Beefeater tour so you can take inall the history. The Crown Jewels aremagnificent. Shoot your photos on the Thames with Tower Bridge in the background.,OK but very long queues
"August 18, 2008",We queued for 45 minutes to get tickets to go in (and not all the ticket booths were open).We really enjoyed the Beefeater and White Tower tour.It is a very interesting place to visit but we found the queuing for everything out weighed the enjoyment of the day.,Great Place to Visit
"June 20, 2008","We were only in London for two days as part of our eleven day European vacation.  We chose to do the British Airways Eye, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, War Museums and the Tower of London.  The Tower of London was, by far, one of the most interesting tourist destinations and well worth the visit.  Unfortunately, we only spent a couple of hours here.  I would recommend at least four hours to see everything and have time to do at a leisurely pace.  Again, we crammed a lot into two days.",We were treated rudely
"June 1, 2008","While the view of the castle is fabulous we were surprised to be treated so rudely by the staff at the Tower of London.  Be warned if you are traveling with children do not take part in the guided tours as the tour guides are not ""child friendly"" and the staff running them did not seem to care for children.",tower of london
"January 23, 2008","This was a really interesting part of my trip. i booked ahead as i thought there might have been a queue but turned out that i wouldnt have had to. still it was very convenient that you can book your ticket on the internet but the date is flexible within 7 days so i could choose when i was free to go within those 7 days (brilliant for tourists with flexible plans).Definitely join an beefeaters tour - they're fantastic!!! great way to mix in the history of the place with an engaging, humorous approach. Seriously it was the best tour i went on in europe.The Crown jewels are quite spectacular, it was just dissapointing that the travellator seems to whiz you by them very quickly... make sure you take a good look! and probably a good idea to get a postacard of the jewels as photos are not permitted (a bit dissapointing actually). But no worries because there are at least three souveneir shops around (subtle hint to get you to buy something??)Im not all that into my battles weapons or protective armor history but if you are there are some brilliant displays.Good day out, take a decent half day if you can to absorb everything.",Crown Jewels are breathtaking!
"September 10, 2007","We visited the Tower of London during our 9 day stay in London in March 2006. My favorite part of the attraction was the Crown Jewels. You actually go into a vault like room and the Crown Jewels are encased in glass with 2 people mover conveyors on either side. Luckily, it was not crowded when we visited and we were able to spend as much time in the vault like room that we wanted. The Tower also has some wonderful gift shops; bought a tiara/crown for myself.The architecture is wonderful and the history alone is one that should draw any tourist to the Tower of London.This is a must see in London.Enjoy!!!",A Great Family Experience
"January 7, 2007",My son and I went in December 2006 and enjoyed this the most of everything we saw in London.  Especially interesting were the men who dressed as and demonstrated what is was like to be a knight.  The Beefeaters were all very knowledeable and entertaining.  The Tower itself is incredible.,Great fun
"October 22, 2006",Although this may seem like an expensive place to visit it is really worth the time and money.  Take the time to walk round and listen with the Yeoman of the Tower you get o hear all the horrid bits of the Tower and also get to go inside the really small chapel.  Its also nice to hear about the people that still live inside the Tower walls.  Inside the White Tower you can see the suit of armour that Henry 8 wore - you ladies reading this look at his protection that was given to his jewels no wonder he went through 6 wives!!!  Good time will be had even if it's not nice weather.,A real must if you're in London for a holiday
"March 18, 2020","A great experience, to begin with. You'll spend at least a couple of hours, maybe even 3 if you go to every available room, courtyard or armory.Also, the audio guide is informative and entertaining, and even moving, from time to time. Fully recommended.",Expensive - but worth it!
"March 17, 2020","I didn't even want to take this tour when we arrived - but my wife and daughter did!  I'm so glad they insisted.  Everything was above excellent.  If you love history, this one that should not be missed",Tower of London
"March 17, 2020",This is a must see if you’re visiting London. Be sure to allow yourself at least several hours to roam through the complex which includes the Crown Jewels and an extensive display of armor. Take the guided tour with one of the ‘Beefeaters’ who are knowledgeable and spirited.,Awesome
"March 10, 2020",Great piece of architecture with great history. Its must visit in london. Often rated as top attraction of london. ,A must watch place
"March 7, 2020",The kids would resonate with the rhyme of London bridge is falling down.Do take the river ride on Thames Clippers,Must visit
"March 7, 2020","This is one of the most visited sites world wide not only in London , to make the most of your visit to understand the history you either join a tour or take the Audio guide and thats what I have done ,using the audio guide will help you understand the history with no rush of the tour, the rich history of this site is over whelming , and you will get the chance to see the royal jewellery there. This place will take between 2 hours and 4 hours of your time ( 4 hours if you want to go deeper in the history side as this castle was the home of many kings and queens ). Best time to visit early morning",Well worth the time and money!
"March 5, 2020","I just wasn’t sure about the price but very glad I made the time to go.So much to see, plan on spending the day.","Dave, Yeoman Warder, was amazing!"
"March 4, 2020","Dave gave us the best introduction to Tower of London! He was really informative and entertaining. We spent two hours exploring. The Crown Jewels was a highlight but the full history was fascinating. And, yes Dave, I thought there was only 1 tower. ",Amazing history
"March 3, 2020",Great place but tickets way over priced for qhat it is.My little boy has been desperate to visit the Tower of London and especially the Crown Jewels. It did not disappoint. The Yeoman tour was brilliant and gave really interesting historical facts. My son loved becoming a knight at knight school.Great day out overall but way too expensive.,Lots of history
"February 28, 2020",The history in this place is amazing. The chance to see the precious crown jewels was worth the price of admission. Also spectacular views of tower bridge. ,Fantastic!
"August 12, 2020","Amazing, beautiful place.  Stunning buildings, fascinating history.  So sad to learn from the Beefeaters that it is facing threat of closure following lockdown.  Please visit!  It is quiet and you will see the crown jewels without the usual queues.",Family visit to the Tower of London
"July 23, 2020",Due to the pandemic we booked as a family for 10.30. We arrived on time and the organisation was excellent. Everyone was extremely helpful. It was a wonderful experience. The Yeomen were exceptional. We were able to see everything. The facilities although limited were excellent. I was with my daughters and grandchildren who loved everything they saw. As an older person everyone was extremely kind and helpful. It was a wonderful experience and we all had a fantastic visit.,Felt ripped off!
"July 22, 2020","Went with kids and family. Mum booked tickets on the website, but didn’t realise a lot of it is closed due to Covid-19!For £25 (instead of the usual £30) I felt ripped off!The grounds and the houses are beautiful - it’s like a little village inside, the yeomen are friendly and helpful, but all we saw was the White Tower and the Crown Jewels - the rest was closed - the kids were looking forward to seeing the Bloody Tower, but it was closed. We all thought it was quite boring!I think £15 is OK to pay. £25 is FAR too much - especially as I am a British taxpayer living in London - these things should be free or heavily discounted for us, it’s our history!In the summer months, roughly 12,000 people visit the tower, at around £30 per person that is ALOT of money!",To many people taking selfies
"July 21, 2020",I really enjoyed my visit to the Tower of London though it was way too busy full of selfie   taking tourists who didn't care about the history of the place. I had to wait 20 minutes to see the crown jewels because of everyone had there backs to it and phones out.,Great time to visit - and support a good cause
"July 19, 2020","This was the second weekend of opening after the COVID closure of summer 2020. We we able to book tickets a couple of days beforehand. Numbers are strictly controlled and this is probably a unique opportunity at any time of year to visit with just a hundred or so visitors within the Tower at any one time. Strongly recommended!Entry was very efficient - we arrived a few minutes early and went straight in - and there is a clear one wau route through the castle. Like most Londoners, I last went when I was ten, so it was great to see it again with more knowledge. I took my teenage daughter for her art project on armour and we spent a happy 90 minutes there - could easily have been longer. The smaller buildings are shut (but there is plenty to see outside), and the Crown Jewels and White Tower had plenty on show inside, including the beautiful Norman chapel. There were enough visitors inside the exhibitions that we felt more comfortable wearing masks - it is not compulsory. The ticket feels good value (and I'm now upgrading my ticket to membership so as to visit Kensigton and Hampton Court too). The beefeaters and guides have plenty of time to explain things to visitors - including the huge impact of COVID on the palaces' finances. If you can visit, it is both a unique time to do so, and a very good cause.One set of toilets is open, but there is no cafe or indoor seating open in the Tower (a takeaway kiosk would be useful), so take a snack and a drink. We ate afterwards, looking over the Thames and with a coffee from the little kiosk by the pier. Catering options in the immediate vicinity are pretty limited, particularly on a Sunday.",TOWER OF LONDON TOUR
"June 13, 2020","If there is a tour you must do while visiting London, it is this one! This tour had so much educational information and was so well explained that if felt like I was living in the actual time. Our tour guide is dressed like a knight and explains in detail everything about the castle. He walks you to the courtyard, the different rooms in the castle, all while explaining everything to you and interacting with you. He challenges you while you learn and makes everyone stay engaged. You will also see how they used to do the changing of the guards there AND you get to see the jewels used by the old kings and queens. It was totally worth it... takes no longer than 2 hours.",Great -- even in the rain
"June 7, 2020",Always love going here. A must is the chapel tour where the go over the history. Not too long and good information.,Thanksgiving holiday
"May 16, 2020","We enjoyed exploring London over Thanksgiving. The Christmas decorations were up so we enjoyed those at night. Tower of London was entertaining, we spent about 3 hours there including a great beefeater tour. ",Amazing
"April 14, 2020",I always had an interest about castles. And this building satisfied me most so far. This place is actually something as cool as Eiffel tower. ,You MUST do the Beefeater tour
"March 22, 2020","Being that we only had about 1.5 days in London before heading to Africa, we had limited time to pick what do to but WOW we are happy we chose that Tower. You can spend HOURS here if you have the Time but we managed to see a lot in about 2.5 hrs. The Beefeater tour, included in the price, is worth it; so much information and great British humor too! Don't miss the Crown Jewels as well! The grounds were beautiful and so many great places to grab pics! Don't miss out on this fantastic attraction: )",Very nice and educational
"September 15, 2020",Good value for money as we spent 4 hours learning British history from one of the cradles. Very interesting and nice. ,Ask for Luis!
"September 14, 2020","A wonderful experience, in particular the tour of the Crown Jewels by Luis who was generous with his time and gave brilliant insight and history to each of the crowns and their diamonds. Thank you for making our day special.",Tower
"September 13, 2020",I think the tickets are a bit pricey but it's worth a visit and the staff are all very informative and friendly,Fantastic History Lesson
"September 7, 2020","The Tower has been in my family history since the early 1400s, my grandfathers were constables at the tower, one grandfather was beheaded there in 1547 and my 2nd cousins Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard also met the same fate. The chance to visit doesn't present itself often due to commitments, however, yesterday was such a day. I'd been chatting with the governor and the curator recently and I seized the moment of opportunity to visit.We parked the car in the Tower Hill Coach and Car-Park just a few minutes walk to the Tower, there were no queues as one might usually expect, as due to COVID-19  you have to pre-book with a time-slot. Well, we arrived 15 minutes early and were let straight in. There was a small bag search on the way in but everyone was socially distanced.Once inside there were no Yeoman warders giving guided tours of course, which is fully understandable, but due to a lack of visitors there was also no ""crush"" to see elements of the tower and we could, at leisure make our way around the tower soaking up the history. At certain points, there were Yeoman warders who were more than happy to chat about history and we learnt quite a few new things yesterday. A special mention to Yeoman Warder Briggs and Yeoman Sergeant Fuller who were very helpful indeed. The crown jewels are usually heaving, queued for ages, but we were able to just walk on in, and linger to view at our leisure, even go up and down the travelator a few times.Accessibility wise, I took my mobility scooter and it was a nightmare on the cobbled streets, a real bone-shaker, but doable. The Disabled toilets behind the jewel house were spotless and worthy of a 5* alone. We couldn't go in the white tower due to mobility issues, but it didn't make for any less an enjoyable visit.If you want to visit.... now is the time to do so",A must in london
"September 6, 2020","If you have time for one thing on London, this should be it. You will be overwhelmed by the history and the whole tower experience. I cannot sell this enough.  ",Great First Time Visit
"September 4, 2020","For some reason we have never tried the Tower of London but seemed the best choice in the current climate.On a warm or hot sunny day this is a must. There are multiple towers to explore , all rich with fascinating royal history. Even with our young children , the content kept their interest throughout the tour.The Crown Jewels are a sight to behold and worth a visit on its own.There were no queues or crowds due to the pandemic which made the whole experience comfortable and we never felt rushed at any point.Furthermore we had the privilege of watching the guards changing as well as regular conversations with the Yeomans.At the moment I would thoroughly recommend a visit.Ps. Be aware of the ravens , they will take your food !There were a couple of food outlets around though for the reason above I would recommend doing this before or after your visit ( upon exit there are multiple cafes / coffee shops). ",Good trip
"September 4, 2020",Good trip though quite expensive also good 4 schools and  colleges in London you need now to be covid-19  friendly ,Another great trip
"September 3, 2020",I have been to the Tower of London before but it was many years ago. I took my partner this time round and they chuffed with the experience.  It’s lockdown so to our surprise it was lovely and quiet considering it was August . The Crown Jewels & armoury was our favourite especially as the staff were so nice around that area.,Fantastic - well worth a visit
"September 2, 2020","As a family of 3 we visited the Tower of London in Aug 20 – when the lockdown had been lifted but everywhere still quiet. I have to say what a fantastic experience this was. Whilst it is sad to see the numbers down and not as many people visiting, but as a tourist to this site it was amazing. No queues to see the Crown Jewels which are truly stunning and breath-taking…in fact they were so mesmerising that we went in twice and on the second time we were in the viewing room alone, we took ages looking at everything, we felt really lucky. The Yeoman guards were all friendly and were keen to answer any questions and were more than happy to talk about the history and points of interest. The guard near the Bloody Tower was particularly informative and he spent ages with us telling us about Sir Walter Raleigh and the history of his time in the Tower. The white Tower is also amazing, with so many interesting and historic pieces to look at and information to read. This place is fantastic, we spent ages walking around, saw the ravens, visited the café and the shop. I know we visited in exceptional times and I hope that the visitor numbers increase for the attraction but believe me seeing this place when it was quite with no queues and being able to go around at our leisure was truly a privilege. It is fantastic. If you only do one thing in London - do this.",Best time to visit
"August 23, 2020","Right now is the best time to visit everything is so quiet - took my children on Friday afternoon pre booked online walked straight in ! Covid 19 precautions taken seriously - hand sanitizer stations / one way systems / and floor markings - not all is open to visit and only select drink/ food stalls , but had a great couple of hours ! Thankyou",Off season relaxed visit
"January 23, 2020","The Tower of London audioguide (which we did) does not do justice to the Beefeater or other in-person guided tours (we were fortunate enough to hear both during the course of our self-guided visit), but is well done and works for self-paced and more in-depth touring. The audioguide was well-done and helpful (particularly the historical content). This is a wonderful season to visit if you have flexibility as there were no crowds and limited lines. We could make multiple passes through the Crown Jewels and White Tower sections, in particular. Staff were helpful and efficient. Definitely worth the visit and walking (multiple staircases).  ",History and marvel
"January 21, 2020",The tower and its story are really interesting even if not so special: tower is very well maintained and kept.Really impressive are the Crown Jewels: a must see in London.,Worth visiting
"January 21, 2020",This was certainly worth a visit during our trip to London. Perhaps a bit pricey but you can spend hours here exploring and finding out about the vast history of London and the monarchy. ,Fun day out
"January 20, 2020",Great chance to explore a place tied in with many of history's infamous characters. The theme actors added to the experience.,An Informative Visit
"January 19, 2020",It was quite interesting to hear the history of the Tower told by Yeoman’s Warder.  Incredible stories of what they used to do and on what appeared to be very scant evidence.,Beautiful view of Tower Bridge
"January 12, 2020",Very interesting place to visit. My favorite part was the photo opportunity of tower bridge. Overall it’s a great history lesson. Next time I will be taking advantage of the free tour. ,Nice places!
"January 10, 2020",This a very import place if you want to get to know a little bit more about London history.The exhibition they have about the jewels of the crown is amazing. You should totally check it out if you have the time ,well worth it
"January 6, 2020",Not just the history that makes it so worth a visit - its the staff- the beefeaters and supporting staff that make it a really nice place to visit- unfailing friendly and helpful from the kind man in the ticket booth who did his best to help with a ticket problem all the way to the staff in the tower -despite the cold weather -the guided tour with the Yeoman warder was funny and informative and staff in various parts of the castle were really friendly and happy to chat  tip- it is cheaper to book online ( you will still have to queue to pick up your tickets)  but be wary of ticket sites that wont give you a refund if you have a problem -go with one that offers a refund,History Beheld
"January 3, 2020","I knew the story of the place, but seeing it in person is something else entirely - I recommend it. The Yeoman guide was pretty amusing too!",The Tower area is a must-see
"January 3, 2020","The Tower of London is part of a larger experience, which is collectively well worth seeing.  The audio tour is a good option. We very much enjoyed it, including seeing the Crown Jewels.",Yeoman Warder tour
"December 31, 2019","We felt lucky to have an excellent tour with Yeoman Warder Lawrence Watts. The fascinating history of the Tower was delivered with great enthusiasm, wit and humour, and he managed to hold the attention of a very large group of British and multinational visitors. It was a tremendous way to start our 5 hour visit. All areas were incredibly busy, but the hour queue to see the Crown Jewels was definitely worthwhile, with the presentation inside very well laid out.",Tower of London
"December 31, 2019",A must see location while visiting London.  So much rich history here to take all in one day.  Enjoy walking the grounds and hearing the stories told by the Beefeaters as well as played out by period actors.  Give yourself a full day to enjoy.  My only regret was I would have arrived earlier.,Ticket organisation could be improved but a great day
"December 31, 2019","When we visited, it was already very busy despite it just opening. After waiting in a queue at a ticket booth for nearly 20 mins, a member of staff told us we needed to go to group tickets to collect on site. We then had to go and join another queue which was frustrating. When you get up close to the group tickets, there is a board on the floor which tells you this is the place to collect tickets. However, given the number of visitors, this was impossible to see on arrival and I think it would be much better if this attraction displayed this information much more prominently. Once we got in though, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will definitely be returning. As others have said, getting to the crown jewels quickly will save you having to queue for too long.",Take the Yeoman Warder tour!
"December 30, 2019","Get here early if you don’t want to stand in long lines to see the Crown Jewels (in the early afternoon we waited about an hour and 20 minutes).  The Yeoman Warder tour is definitely worth the 45 minutes it takes; history - royals, murder, executions -, and a good bit of humor mixed in.  Yeoman Warders are incredibly knowledgeable, approachable, and personable, even answering individual questions once the tour has concluded.  A must see/do if you’re visiting London! ",A MUST
"December 30, 2019","A real great place to see. Very successful so you need to expect a very crowded area, particularly if you want to see Crown Jewels (magnificent) and White Tower with its great collection of armours. 2 hours will be at least necessary, but count 3 because of waiting times to access best places. Enjoy",Amazing MUST See
"December 29, 2019","Plan on walking a ton, taking many stairs and not caring a bit. This is a must see if you are in London. Plan on spending the better part of your day here. The armory is set up like a piece of artwork, the jewels are stunning.. and don’t forget the beheading places and the Black crows. Our families favorite part of the trip. ","Interesting, Fun, Historical London Must See"
"December 29, 2019","No visit to London is should be complete without a tour to Tower Caste. It’s expansive presence on the River Thames provides hours of entertainment and history. It’s a self guided tour so you can take as long as you want, but the architecture and artifacts there make it worth lingering. If you hope to see the Crown Jewels, planned to arrive early before long lines form.",Tower of London
"December 28, 2019",What is a trip to London without a visit to the Tower of London?  My friend and I opted for the beefeater tour-thankfully it was a clear but cool day.  The beefeater tour is outside.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it when visiting the tower since it gives you more background.  There are a lot of steps (240) so beware.  I did enjoy the tower and the display of armor throughout the ages.  I was expecting to see cells as this was an old prison and was disappointed by that.  Bad of me?,A Fabulous Slice of History
"December 28, 2019","I've been to London several times, but always avoided the Tower of London because of tales about crowds, but being there on a fine Fall day in the ""shoulder season"" was very rewarding.The Tower of London is a misnomer. The photo is of White Tower, an early fortified palace. However there are 40 buildings inside a walled compound, telling English history spanning several centuries. There's Traitor's Gate where 'enemies of the state' were brought in by water to their jail cell or execution, but there are also museums on the grounds, excellent education signage, the quarters where Sir Francis Drake was quartered with his family -- three times -- before being executed may years later. And be sure to join any group getting a lecture from a Warder (the proper name for the mis-named Beefeaters). They are superbly educated on the history of the compound and sometimes funny too. Don't forget to view the Crown Jewels assembled over many years of the British Empire. You can be there for hours if you want to soak in the importance of this site (which is right near Tower Bridge and water tours on the Thames).","""A sight no one ever beheld without Astonishment"""
"December 28, 2019","Tower of London is synonymous to  the Crown Jewels and in itself does not need an introduction. Visiting this palace, go straight to the Crown Jewel as it has the longest line up. There's a lot to see as it comprise of a few buildings and boasts of it thousand years of history. Be wary of steep and narrow stairs and uneven terrain/steps. I find that buying tickets online is a bit cheaper that at the gate.Its interesting to see the White Tower and its Royal Armouries with the giant sculpture of Dragon and King's Lineage and Medieval Palace. Also, it is very close to the London Tower Bridge which makes for great selfies/pictures.Hope This helps,GorgeousRaquel",Great morning out!
"November 2, 2019",It was my mom's first trip to London. This was her favorite stop. The free tour is short but packed with info. Then you are free to roam and explore. Would definitely recommend. ,Crown Jewels fantastic
"November 2, 2019","We thoroughly enjoyed the Tower of London. Even with Heavy crowds things moved smoothly. Plenty of food choices, interesting areas to visit, easy to know what your were looking at or walking. Just an enjoyable historical place to visit.",Arrive early!
"November 2, 2019",We took the advice on another review and arrived early to ensure we would see the crown jewels.  And we did!  Without a line to wait in.  Great historical learning experience.  Would recommend a visit!,Very busy
"October 31, 2019",Used our historic palaces pass and walked straight through. The audio guide helped us to move around and gave us a great insight into the tower. It had interesting facts and stories for different areas. The queue for the crown jewels was very long so we skipped it this time and there were areas where you couldn't get through due to crowds. ,Excellent place for some history
"October 31, 2019",I am a huge history nut so this was a must see on my London Bucket list. I'm going back to London and plan on going to the Tower again.,Worth every penny
"October 31, 2019","Visited the Tower of London and was surprised at how many different uses it had through history. The Yeomen Warders ran a free walking tour from the entrance which was worth it. Our tour guide was hilarious and great with kids. It’s clear they take their job seriously and pride themselves on the service they provide. We heard several stories and were able to navigate the main areas. Afterwards, we wandered the grounds, saw the Crown Jewels, areas where zoo animals were held, the ravens and several exhibitions. Staff were all friendly and helpful. Great views of Tower Bridge also. A must visit when in London. ",Amazing
"October 31, 2019",Amazing Place. Great guides. Expensive coffe. I would go there again. There is much to see. And it is a great part of our European history. ,Yeoman Warden Matt was great!
"October 30, 2019",We really enjoyed the Warden tour!  Matt was very knowledgeable and very funny. He made the tour entertaining and explained about the Tower and the parts to see.  I would recommend doing the tour with the Warden first.,Met a terrible D C Phillips who was beyond terrible.
"October 30, 2019","I visited the Tower of London on Wednesday 30th October 2019. Basically the attraction is to see the Crown Jewels. I saw a beefeater D C Phillips and a boy was taking a photo of his parents with beefeater Phillips.  I went up and tap the boy on his shoulder to get his attention, and asked him if he can take a photo for me with beefeater Phillips?  I was condescendingly reprimanded by beefeater Phillips and I was close to tears as I have never in my entire life been treated this terribly before. I have traveled and toured 5 continents, and lived my whole life in 2 continents, and I lived in Leeds, England, as a tertiary student for 4 years.  In my many years of touring various countries in various continents, this is the most unexpected shocking incident that I’ve encountered. It is with great sadness in my heart that I relate this terrible encounter with D C Phillips at the Tower of London.",I could stare at the crown jewels for hours!
"October 29, 2019","Interesting tour where you can learn a lot of history about England and her people, along with the Monarchy.  We especially enjoyed the room with the crown jewels - such pagentry.  I need to buy myself a crown!  You have access to many buildings and there are people (Beefeaters) who enjoy telling you the history and significance of everything.",Historical Site
"November 5, 2019",Had a great time walking around with my wife looking at all the different exhibitions. Laid out very user friendly and easy to navigate. A must visit while in London. ,"If you ever visit London, Tower of London is a MUST SEE!"
"November 4, 2019","give yourself plenty of time to visit this castle, its a must see castle with a lot of history and the Crown Jewels. need at least 5 hours for the visit.",A “must” when in London 
"November 4, 2019","Take a tour with a “Beefeater” inside the Tower of London and learn a little about this famous place.Very interesting for both adults and teenagers!  I would recommend going there early, to avoid the longest queues. ",Yeoman Warder Tour - A+
"November 4, 2019","Expensive, but worth the price. Arrive early (preferably at opening)...go directly to the Crown Jewels Room (to avoid hours-long waits later)...next go to the Yeoman Warder Tour (BEST part of the day!) where you will learn EVERYTHING you need to know about the rest of your visit. Lovely day, wonderful experience. We spent twice as long as we had planned, there was so much to see! **PS Find a 2-for-1 coupon at ""Days Out London"".",Fabulous
"November 3, 2019","I arrived just after opening and there was hardly a queue. I didn't bother with the beefeater tour, audio or a guidebook as I like to fo my own thing. Pick up a free map as it suggests a basic route and you can then fit in the other bits yourself. There are plenty of information boards in multiple languages and even some Tudors still walking round! Give yourself 3 hours plus even at quiet times so you don't need to rush. The Crown Jewels are amazing, which I think is to be expected, but I found the armouries very interesting even though I didn't expect to. I was in awe to be able to walk in the footsteps of such as Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.",Pinnacle of London History!
"November 3, 2019",The Tower of London and the history behind it paints a picture of the ruling class and the many uses of the Tower and surrounding infrastructure throughout the years. The tour with a resident Beefeater is a must! The Crown Jewels and museum of artifacts are a nice touch. ,Hungary
"November 2, 2019",Do not miss it.Wery intresting and nice exhibition and building. Buy your ticket in advance not to wait too much.,Great morning out!

"October 9, 2019",This attraction is included with the London Pass. So its a direct entry to the gate. You don't need to visit the ticket counter. Please note that those with baby cart it can be quite difficult to carry the cart as climbing lots of stairs are involved in the visit. You can park your baby card just after the Traitors Gate by putting a 1 pound coin. The nearest metro station is Tower Hill and from there its only walkable distance. There is a tour with Yeoman Warders every 30 minutes. Sometimes it can be quite crowded but is also a good option to take the audio tour which is almost equivalent to what they say. You can have your own tour at your own pace. Expect about 2 - 3 hours of visit time.,A Must See
"October 8, 2019","This is a must-see on your visit to London.  I recommend buying your tickets online in advance to avoid lines.  We got there soon after it opened and went straight to the crown jewels before it got too crowded.  After that, we walked back to the entrance area to take the free yeoman warder's tour.  Not only do you get a great history lesson but it was very entertaining.  Shout out to our hilarious guide Jason Woodcock.  You can spend anywhere from a couple of hours here to all day.  It just depends on how much you want to see and read.",Expensive outing
"October 8, 2019","This was on our must-see list while in London but it wasn't as much of a hit with the group as we expected. The extra 'donation' cost caught us at the ticket booth - that seems to be common at a number of London attractions to automatically include it unless you ask to remove it (which then seems mean spirited).We visited midweek, off-peak season and it was still really busy. Loads of school groups too.A few of of the exhibits are fresh and attractive but others are tired. I visited a number of years ago and found the crown jewels a lot more attractive in how they were presented then.The higlight was the manager in the gift shop, she was chatty and knew lots - particularly about the ravens, more than was shared at the actual raven talk by one of the Yeoman Warders (who by his admission wasn't the Raven Master).",A London Must See
"October 7, 2019","We arrived in time to take an yeoman warder tour (free).  This tour lasts about 45 minutes and includes many stories and anecdotes.  Get the audio guide to complete the visit.  If the day is busy, go to the Crown Jewels first.  Be sure to visit the Bloody Tower.  Learn about the Ravens. We spent 4+ hours there, and there was still more that we could have done.",Good history! 
"October 7, 2019",Just visited the Tower of London and had a good time. The history was explained and lots of things to see. The royal jewels were great to see!,Beefeater tour was great!
"October 7, 2019",Had a great visit!  You must do a beefeater tour!!!  Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly was our guide and was fabulous. My 13 year old loved his stories and was amongst the first to follow him around the tower to hear his stories and history. It was great to be able to put some of the stories we heard on our tour with some of the other places we visited.,A must
"October 7, 2019","Didn’t have a lot of time here, wish we would have had more time to explore. We were later in the day arriving and they close up promptly at 5pm. Go early. The Crown Jewels are amazing and there is just so much history here.",Awesome History!
"October 7, 2019","We were pleasantly surprised that we did not have to wait in a line to get in.  We were able to join a Beefeater tour immediately. Although the history at the tower is quite gruesome, Spike made our tour fun.  The crown jewels were quite impressive but the collection seemed quite small.",Gruesome London Tower
"October 6, 2019","If you have any anticipated ideas on the Tower of London, you can be positively surprised when you actually visit it. The beefeaters are able to recreate a historical atmosphere that cannot be beaten. Besides, the traditions and real events seem just as real as a current affair.The crown jewels are of indelible value. Unforgettable experience indeed.",Interesting site tour
"October 6, 2019",I've been to the Tower of London a couple of times and have always found it interesting. Amazing history for you to see and experience. i suggest a tour guide who talks about all the nuances of the Tower and its history.,History at its most fun!
"October 5, 2019","This was my second visit to the Tower of London, but the first with my family. The Yeoman Warder guided tour was funny, informative and entertaining. The mixture of architecture, historical importance, weapons and armor was enough to appeal to everyone. My visits were almost 20 years apart but this attraction has not lost its spark and i would recommend visiting to anyone and everyone who is exploring London.",History and humour from the beefeaters
"October 12, 2019",A very iconic part of London history. The beefeater tours run for a perfect 45 minutes and are worth the entry fee themselves. Don’t go on a rain day if possible as the tour will get cut short and not many sheltered areas.,Great interesting visit!
"October 12, 2019","If you like history, this is a must.  Fascinating history and lots to see.  Leave at least 3 hours in order to see it all.  I also reccommend getting the audio tour-- it costs extra but it was worth it for the information.   You could also read your way through the exhibits if you'd rather but the audio tour still provides a bit extra.  Plus there is a bit on the audio tour that you can listen to while waiting in line to see the crown jewels.",Wow 
"October 11, 2019","A must if you are in London!  The buildings, jewels, beef eaters and all are worth a few of climbing stairs (204) in tower. ",Mind blowing walk through history!
"October 11, 2019","The amount of historical events that took place in just this one place is incredible! To fully appreciate it take the live narrated tour. Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, some of the oldest buildings in London, and the Crown Jewels. WOW! The narrated walking tours are included in your admission, but only go at certain times. When we went, the last one was at 3:30. Earlier is better so you can take time to read all the information plaques and appreciate where you are. Easy to get to from the Tower Hill tube station. Look for the ticket booths across the plaza from the castle, then you walk down to the entrance. Take the tour!",Terrific tour
"October 11, 2019","I cannot imagine a better tour than the (free) one my (adult) daughter and I took in late July with Yeoman Warder Lawrence Watts as our guide at the Tower of London.  He imparted the information with humility, extensive knowledge, the most wonderful humor, and extreme patience.  At one point a child was sitting on the ground in front of him, piling leaves and little rocks on his shoes as he spoke.  He did not miss a beat. It is, by the way, a great honor to be a ""Beefeater"" or Yeoman Warder of Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London.  Warders are retired from the Armed Forces of the Commonwealth with at least 22 years of service and hold the Long Service and Good Conduct medal. Allow plenty of time for the tour, looking around, and seeing the Crown Jewels (there will probably be a long line).",So much history
"October 10, 2019","I always thought of the Tower of London as the place where the Crown Jewels were kept and didn’t know much else. However, the Beefeaters there do a phenomenal job of guiding you through the grounds and teaching you about the history surrounding it. Definitely get there early, like before it opens early, to get your tickets b/c there is definitely going to be a line. We go there one hour early and were the first in line. Once they opened, we had our tickets and were inside in less than 10 minutes. Totally worth it to get there early in the day, especially because it enabled us to see the Crown Jewels without being crowded by a mass of people. If you’re visiting on a Sunday, just know you can’t visit the chapel b/c its closed on Sundays. The Tower should absolutely be on your must see list and plan to be here for about 3-4 hours if you really want to see everything. ",The Crown Jewels
"October 10, 2019","What a beautiful collection of family heirlooms Wow, I have never seen so much BLING in my life. Downside NO PICTURES allowed.",Beefeater tour is a must
"October 10, 2019","My folks and I went on the 10am beefeater tour on Oct 10. Our tour guide, Andrew (Shady) was amazing. He directed a very large group with ease, not one person complained. He was extremely informative, very funny and was really good at engaging the group. Would I go again? Absolutely. ",Tower of London
"October 10, 2019","OMG I had no idea the Tower of Lindon could be such an interesting excursion. I loved it!  Our tour guide had so much passion, knowledge and pride of the history behind the tower that it was awesome to hear it. The Crown Jewels exhibit was the icing on the cake. A must see while in London!","A ""Towering"" Experience"
"October 10, 2019","We gave it about 3 1/2 hours which allows for a good over-viewof all the major displays/attractions. Highlights for us were thearmor display, the several cells--especially where Sir ThomasMoore was held, the area where prisoners carved messages inthe wall, and the execution area. The Crown jewels of course are beautiful but the viewing is so much like  beingherded along like cattle at a pace that allows only limitedviews--one can go through a second time if you want to stand in line twice. We had a just ok but pricey lunch  in the old marketbuilding. Overall, a very worthwhile attraction. A longer visitprobably is warranted if one is really into the long history of allthe various  ""towers"". A negative is the limited amount oftoilets (WC)-we encountered lines both times we had need.",Highlight of London Vacation
"October 5, 2019","This is a must see while in London. The grounds are loaded with history and the buildings are incredible. The Crown Jewels should be your first stop, arrive early as soon as they open and head up the hill to the Crown Jewel building as later in the day it will become uncomfortably crowded.  Be sure to also find the Beefeater tour, very informative and entertaining.  Overall a must see stop while in London!",Fave attraction in London
"October 4, 2019",Skipped the a Tower of London in 2004. Didn’t make that mistake in 2019. Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly gave an amazing tour. The history....  The torture....  The gore....  It’s a good time!  They also have the Crown Jewels and Henry VIII’s armor on display.  Just go!,Amazing History!
"October 4, 2019",Such a great venue to learn about the history of this Tower.  And the Crown Jewels (of course) are a must see!.  ,Nice Place !
"October 3, 2019",A lot of history here. We quite enjoyed ther tour. A lot to see and a lot of walking. It was very interesting and a must to see. Was number 1 on my wifes list.,A “must visit”
"October 3, 2019","A super interesting, must visit place while in London. I will say that the tours with the Beefeaters are fantastic and I wish they covered more of the place. You will be on your own with just a map for the remainder. As with any historical site, you should read a little about the place before you go and ToL has a fascinating history.Tickets are a bit pricey but it is well worth the visit. if you have someone in your party with mobility issues, be warned that there are many many stairs.",A Must do!

"October 3, 2019","Family trip to the Tower it was amazing. We caught the boat down the Thames from the London Eye. So much history, so many stories, Torture in the tower, story of the missing princes,  Anne Boylen, Crown Jewels, Armour collection, prisoners in the tower, animals in the tower. We spent 3.5 hours there but could easily have spent longer.  A few cafes/restaurants inside and a few gift shops. ",Quite an impressive sight

"October 1, 2019","Pay to go inside, or spend a few hours around the perimeter, guided by signs posted giving you the history of each section of the Tower of London. Beautifully laid out and very informative whichever way you choose. ",Spent the morning here
"September 30, 2019","We toured the Tower of London for about 4 hours and enjoyed our visit.  This is a self paced tour where you walk around the buildings and visit various areas of the space.  There are lots of steps to climb, but you are able to choose what you want to do.  My husband chose to climb the 110 steps up to the white tower, and I did not do that section of the tour.  There are many places to rest around the space.  If you have some family members who want to see everything, they could and you could rest.  There is a nice cafeteria area which is air conditioned and I waited there.  Of all the palaces and castles that we toured in London, this was my least favorite.  I am really not into weapons or hearing about battles.  However, the crown jewel exhibit was amazing. I would not miss that section of the Tower.  In that area, everyone rides on a conveyor belt past the crowns and other large jewels.  If you want to go in and see it again, that is fine.  Nothing is restricted to a one time viewing once you are within the Tower walls.",Be sure to allot plenty of time
"September 29, 2019","Excellent Beefeater (Yeoman Warder) tour full of humor and history. Appreciated the tips for exploring the various places to see. Loved the Crown Jewels, which we visited early on in our day, which I would recommend as it does get busy. Did notice several people disrespecting the no taking photos in certain areas rule. Moving to wander around where so much has taken place and experience audio, video, children’s activity areas- quite a gamut to suit people’s interests. Great views around the battlements. Interesting to see  the girth of King Henry Vlll’s armour. An ice cream interlude was a nice pick me up in a several hours visit. Go early as you may linger longer than you anticipated. So interesting!",One of the best royal castle experiences in the world
"September 29, 2019","It seems like there is a castle/chateau/schloss every few miles in Europe but there are very few that offer an experience that is five-star.  The Tower of London, Hampton Court, Versailles, to name a few.  What separates The Tower of London from others and puts it above all the castles in the rest of the world is that it is largely intact; there is a short, free tour (Scott Kelly, our Yeoman Warder was EXCELLENT); it houses the kingdom's crown jewels to view in person; there are audio, video, virtual and children activities; the museum has a vast array of unusual artifacts; and the value is incredible because we spent five hours there and still feel like we could have spent more time.",Don’t miss
"September 28, 2019",We have been to London numerous times and our visit always includes the Tower we learn something new each time whether touring ourselves or joining one of the Yeoman’s guided tours So much history ,A must see in London
"September 28, 2019","There's a lot to see, so schedule a lot of time.  There is a lot of walking and many, many steps.  It was fascinating to see such history, from remnants of the Roman occupation, to the torture chambers, to King Henry VIII's armor.  We loved it and want to return to see more.  The crown jewels are a must see.",Fascinating history of London.
"September 27, 2019",We spent an afternoon exploring the Tower and even three hours wasn’t enough to experience all it has to offer. Allow plenty of time and ensure you get the audio guide to make the most of your visit. Crowds aplenty but still an enjoyable experience. ,A must if you are visiting London
"September 27, 2019",We visited as a couple.  Eventhough we live in London and drive past often we decided to visit this time.  An amazing place to visit with a lot of history and of course the crown jewels are amazing.  I would allow atleast 3 hours to see everything properly.,A Must See for First Time Tourists to London
"September 26, 2019","Of course you must go to the Tower of London. It’s a better experience if you arrive early, it’s much less crowded. We were in when the opened. We used our London Pass. It’s the only way to see the London attractions, down load them to your iPhone wallet.It’s a bummer that they don’t allow photos of the Crown Jewels, but we understand there are reasons. It doesn’t take long to visit TOL depending on how much you are into museums, etc. We got through and took a taxi in time to see changing of the guard at Buckingham. If you want to do the boat ride back to Westminster, you won’t make it to the Buckingham in time,",On the All Time Favorite’s list now
"October 10, 2019","So, let me start by saying I’m not prone to enjoying “tours” or guides, that said, it seems like my wife plans one for just about every place we visit and I really enjoy her so...I end up on a lot of tours. The tour here was conducted by a Beefeater named Shady (sic) and it was an absolute delight! He was informative, witty, and very knowledgeable and entertaining about the Tower. Bonus, the tour was included with the admission ticket so it’s a complete no brainier. A great way to spend 45 minutes to an hour.",Great
"October 10, 2019",What a great visit! Weather was perfect adding to the enjoyment - get your tickets in advance and arrive early - well worth the cost of admission.,Informative half day a tivity
"October 10, 2019","It’s a busy attraction with a lot of school groups during week days. We joined the free guided tour, which proved to be very informative and our guide Shadee (sp?) was lively and entertaining. The Crown Jewels on display were amazing to see up close. ",Tower of London a must see!
"October 10, 2019","I have been visiting the Tower since I was a child in the 50s.  It is a definite must. And it is a good idea spend the day there.  So much to see and do including a walking tour with one of the Yeomen Gards (Beef Eaters).  Your tour gard will tell you the history, the legends, and point out all the places where famous people from the past have been incarcerated.Also at the Tower are the Crown Jewels and religious relics used during coronations. There is so much to see and do and there are cafes serving full lunches and sanwiches or you can bring your own picnic.",Worth the reasonable price of admission
"October 9, 2019","When you consider the MANY areas of significance of this London landmark, and you consider the value of the expert and humorous narration provided by the Beefeaters (yeoman warders), this is a tourist must-visit site.  Plan for a minimum of 90 minutes, longer if you want to visit every corner and nook of the site.  ",Do the free tour!
"October 9, 2019","My husband and I kept debating about going here. We spent the money and did it, and it ended up being one of our favorite things we did!  Once you enter, you’ll see there is a spot to wait for one of the beefeaters to give you a tour. They go off every 30 minutes if I remember correctly. Well, it’s so worth it!  Our guide was awesome!  He was loud, real, and know so much history. It was a entertaining way to get into the history that is behind the Tower of London. Grab a free map and make sure you check out all the different things to see, some of them are easy to miss. Do the Crown Jewels first as there is always a little line. ",Fantastic Experience
"October 9, 2019",We were very impressed with the Tower of London. The tour guide was knowledgeable and entertaining. The Crown Jewels were well worth the short (1/2 hour) wait!,So much history
"October 9, 2019","It's simply a must if you never been there. There's history everywhere, with lots of interesting things to see. Use comfortable shoes and be prepared to walk a lot.",Great part of History
"October 9, 2019",Went as part of a tour. Lots of people and very informative. Security went very smooth and I would highly recommend to everyone.,What a fabulous place to spend a day!!
"October 9, 2019","We visited at the end of March 2019, never been before, wished we had!  And yes, so much bigger than we thought, so much to see - wonderful!!  As with other attractions, we used the 2for1 train offer and it saves such a lot of money meaning we enjoy it even more!!  A friends advice was to arrive as they opened, bought tickets with no problems at the ticket office and to go immediately to the Crown Jewels as a queue builds up through the day.  We walked in at 11am and just a handful of people looking at the jewels, by 1230 there was a long long snaking line of people all around the building going around the corner!!On this occasion we decided not to do the guided tour but the buy the lovely guidebook and make our own way around in our own time, we did pick up snippets of the guides telling groups all about the history, and no doubt next time we go we may do a tour.  Everything was totally fascinating, the displays, the towers, walks along the battlements, seeing the ravens, reading the information and not realising how much history it contained - yes, we British do that well - hanging on to our history and informing everyone and making it so interesting to all - whether you are 70 or 7 you will love it.  And don't forget the views - you can see across the Thames and all the iconic landmarks, Tower Bridge, The Shard etc etc - gorgeous!! The uniforms, the pomp and ceremony, the colour - shame we missed the filming of 'Inside the Tower of London' which must have happened there just after we visited - watch it on TV or iPlayer, its wonderful!!We spent the day there before our theatre trip in the evening, well worth the whole day, but do take a picnic and drinks as with all attractions it can be pricey to eat there.  But saying that, just before we left we went into the cafe which I think was inside the Artillery Museum and had an extremely refreshing mug of tea for a £2 a mug - now that really IS good value!!",Great Time and Tour
"September 17, 2019","We did a 2-hour tour with Sara of Context tours.  It was a beautiful day and she did an excellent job.  We started early in the morning and did not even have a long wait to see the Crown Jewels.  There was a lot to take in, but it all was fascinating.",Not handicapped accessible
"September 17, 2019",This  was an interesting tour and very informative. However I have a bad knee and no elevators were available. So I missed out on some of the towers because I couldn't walk the steps.,Take the guided tour
"September 16, 2019",This was one of our favorite attractions while in London.  Clive was our beefeater guide.  He was hilarious.  Plan on spending at least 3 hours while there. ,Don't miss this.
"September 16, 2019","If you have to choose attractions, choose this one.  Not only will you see the crown jewels (not personal jewels) put you will learn a lot of history. Buy tickets from the Hop On/Off buses for a discount. ",The Crown Jewels are impressive
"September 16, 2019",Definitely worth the price of admission Seeing the crown jewels was definitely the highlight for me Also the Beefeater who does the explanation of what went on there did an excellent job - make sure you wait for the tour - it is no extra cost ,Great place
"September 16, 2019","Great place to visit, our warden on the walk Kevin, was informative and entertaining.  Amenities were clean and accessible.  ",Tower of London
"September 16, 2019","Very majestic place with a big history. We love it very much. It was about three hours to see the buildings, jewellery and much more.",Vacation
"September 16, 2019","One of my bucket list places.. and I wasn't disappointed. This experience was remarkable, especially if English history is of interest.  ",Closing time
"September 15, 2019","We ran out of time, but went anyway. It was only about half hour - forty five minutes, but we were able to easily see the Crown Jewels and white tower.Worth a visit. ",Good but expensive (unless you travel by train)
"September 15, 2019",We were just up for the day from Cambridge and made use of the 1/2 price offer when you travel by train. We followed a tour by a Yeoman Warder which was long enough to cover the basics yet allowed time to tour alone. The Royal treasures are spectacular and very impressive and the highlight of the day. The catering is only OK and the displays in the White tower a bit  boring  but it shows living history. ,If you do one thing in London do the Tower!
"September 15, 2019","We visited the London tower recently with our children 11 & 12 who found it fascinating and fun. The tower was definitely one of our highlights of our London trip it was our favourite when we visited 14 years ago and still holds its charm. There is so much history in those walls and the staff and Beef Eater tour are very entertaining. A shout out to Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly who had the huge crowd gathered around him well entertained!! He definitely made the visit  it that much more interesting and fun.There is also interactive level in the tower for the kiddies with bow and arrow simulation, cannon firing to mention a few.. A very enjoyable day. 😊",The highlight of our London Visit
"September 15, 2019","I really enjoyed the tower, so much history in one place.  We were at the tower for about 3 hours but we took our time and wandered about on our own. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as there was alot of walking and alot of stairs to deal with.  It was a bit crowded but enjoyed seeing the crown jewels.  Also enjoyed hearing the story of the ravens and watching them roam the grounds.  Oddly, it was a great place to get some pictures of the tower bridge and the modern building nearby.  If you get hungry, there are some great restaurants on the farside of the gift shop outside the tower.  We ate at a Pret A Manger which had decent food and good coffee but there was also a pasty shop, Subway, KFC and some ""sit down"" restaurants.       ",Outstanding 
"September 15, 2019","Probably the best attraction in London Don’t miss the Yeoman Warden (Ex- Forces ) tour ..... all you will ever need to know about the Tower... and Free If you’re going to London don’t miss it  Can get busy so pick you time , afternoons seem to be better ",Take a beefeater tour
"September 15, 2019","There's free tours throughout the day and they are brief (30 minutes?) but informative and fun.  You learn a bit about the history of the buildings and the famous people who lived or were imprisoned there, as well as those that still live there today. The line for the crown jewels go fast so don't be deterred, it's worth a walk through. ",All day visit!
"September 14, 2019",I only had a 2 days in London so the Tower of London was a must see on my list. I tried to site see as much but played it by ear. Luckily I made the Tower of London my first stop. I had no idea I would spend 4 hours there. I actually could have spent more time there but I wrapped it up to try and get some other sights in. The best part was the Jewels! Bling bling my eyes sparkled. Behind all that the history is always interesting and I am glad we made the visit. Please get the audio tour it is completely worth it. They also have gift shops through out the castle and stop and get ice cream there. It’s delicious! ,"A trip through history, the crown jewels are a must see"
"September 14, 2019","My husband and had an hour for the tour, but it's not enough, so plan about 2 hours to be able to really see everything in the Tower. It's quite interesting to see medieval fortresses from the inside. Nut my favorite part of it were the crown jewels, mesmerizing! Unfortunately no pictures are allowed inside (of course)",Crown Jewels OMG!
"September 14, 2019",Tower of London transports the visitor back in time! Came out of the visit understanding the roles and plights of Royals and not Royals. The Crown Jewels really emphasizes the chasm between the haves and have nots.  So amazing.  Highly recommended while visiting London,BEEF EATER TOUR
"September 14, 2019","You will need to get to the tower in the morning to really enjoy all of it.  We got there in the afternoon and didn't get to see all of it, as it was closing.  Next time I will definitely go in the morning.  Standing in queue to see the Crown Jewels is worth it - a must see.  You will not be disappointed with the Beef Eater Tour - had a laugh and learned lots.",A LONDON MUST SEE
"September 13, 2019",I think the Tower of London was one of my favorite things to do the London. The beefeaters tour was great. They were really knowledgeable and entertaining. I loved the Crown Jewels. There is a diamond in a crown that is 500+ carats. No pics inside viewing the jewels and wear comfortable shoes because not only is there a lot of walking but the ground is uneven and makes your dogs bark sooner than normal.,Amazing!
"September 13, 2019","The way the British have maintained and honored the history of their country is amazing.  This is a beautiful place to visit and, if you ask questions, the staff is happy to engage in a share of knowledge.",Fascinating 
"August 29, 2019",A brilliant place for history lovers. The beefeaters are brilliant. There are audio cassettes and there are tours to take you to see Anne’s resting place.,where is the ticket office?
"August 28, 2019","Has anyone bought online tickets that have to be ""redeemed"" at the Tower of London Redemption Center? I would like to see a picture of what that window/door looks like and where it is in relation to the entrance to the actual Tower tour.",Make Sure You Plan for the Beefeater Tour
"August 28, 2019","The tour with the Beefeater was the highlight of my trip to the Tower of London. I caught the last tour of the day and the trip would not have been the same without it. my guide was Spike, and he was wonderful! Obviously very knowledgable, but also very funny, which made the tour that much more enjoyable. The complex is very large, so I wish I had left more time for my visit. The ticket price is very expensive, and it is of course very crowded but overall I enjoyed my time there. The crown jewels was not worth the wait in line as the crowd was so massive you could barely even see the jewels once inside.",Great Tour
"August 28, 2019","This was a great tour. A word of advice is to get there early, and head directly to the the Crown Jewels. The queue for the Crown Jewels becomes quite long as the day progresses. The Tower of London itself is magnificent. It is a sight to see especially with the backdrop of modern day London. Lots of stairs to navigate so make sure you wear comfortable shoes. A great experience.",London Tower
"August 26, 2019",Get there early and start with The Crown Jewels before the lines get long and you can take your time looking. Take the tours with the Beefeaters you learn a lot of history. Lots of walking and steps...so worth it if you can climb steps and go through small stairways. My mom and I had a great time.,Enjoyed
"August 26, 2019","We arrived right as they opened and did not have to wait in line. It was suggested that we see the crown jewels first as it is less crowded first thing.  This was so helpful!  We went there first, again no waiting!  Throughout the day as we continued our tour we saw the line becoming increasingly longer.  Do yourself a favor and see the jewels first when they open.",A Must See
"August 26, 2019","We arrived when it first opened to beat the crowds and we are glad we did.  The first place we went to was the Crown Jewels and we walked right in without waiting.  Two hours later there was a line of about 50-75 people waiting to go in.  We used the London Pass to avoid the ticket queue.  You must do the free Yeoman Warder tour to learn about the history of the Tower.  Our Beefeater, Spike, was very entertaining.  Make sure you visit the different towers and the museum.  Watch for the ravens, they like to pose for photos.",Historical Gem in London
"August 25, 2019","We spent 3 hours here walking around the White Tower, the Bloody Tower, Traitor's Gate and the Crown Jewels.  It is worth brushing up on your English history before a visit. A couple of tips , buy tickets online in advance and arrive before opening to avoid a huge line up.  The jewels are incredible and so is the history of the Tower.  Enjoyed our visit very much. ",It was Ok
"August 25, 2019","I visited at the insistence of friends that had visited. The place is nice and historic but the room where the “jewels “are under delivered in wow effort, it was just ok. I thought all Queen Elizabeth crowns were there and it’s only a few of them. I could have skipped this as none of it wowed me but that is just my personal experience. ",Dream come true
"August 25, 2019",I have been an Anglophile since I was twelve.To actually step into the very room the brother Princes were killed in is truly a dream come true. It is a must!,Amazing best attraction in London 
"August 11, 2019",This was my favourite attraction in London. We purchased a 1 Day London pass and visited this as our first stop. Get there as it opens as the queues pile up quick! You don’t need to queue to get a ticket you just show your London pass and they scan it. Head straight to the Crown Jewels exhibition (marked as a purple crown on map) as the queues get enormous ! There is a free app to guide you around the place but it is also easy to follow on the free map they give you. Allow 2hrs to see it all. ,Go early 
"August 11, 2019","After reading reviews we made sure we were there right at opening . No line ups and we went straight to the Crown jewels . Again, no line ups . We spent approximately three hours there and when we left there were lineups for the crown jewels - which are incredible - and to enter . Definitely worth seeing and you can avoid long lines by being early ",Crown jewels
"August 10, 2019","when in London If you see any thing this is the site to see, the history, and the royal treasure is fantastic",Something to see 
"August 10, 2019","Spent a dreary fall afternoon wondering around the tower. Saw the English Crown Jewels, got to speak with a Yeoman Warder, see were Queen Anne Boleyn was executed, and the famous Royal Ravens. There is also the collection of arms and armour on display, statues of the menagerie that was kept on the grounds as well as others displays of happenings in that took place in and around the tower.",100% cancellation penalties
"August 10, 2019",Penalties are unenforceable in English Law so cancellation policy should say something like fees are non refundable. If you buy on line by Law you have a cooling off period ,Great!
"August 8, 2019","Mandatory visit when in London and great view of the Thames. Also, great energy. I could ""feel"" history in every breath I've taken.",A highlight of our trip
"August 8, 2019","We spent the day here and it wasn’t enough time to see everything! The Crown Jewels were so incredible that we walked through twice. We asked a staff member a question and he turned out to be an actor for an event. He asked if the kids wanted to join his gang and invited us to the event. This turned out to be a fun, interactive event that was also really informative. The actors were very engaging and at the end the kids received a reward. Afterwards, they invited the kids to join them for music and dancing. The information provided was so interesting that I did further research after we left, which to me, is the sign of a good tour.","Great experience, highly recommend however ...."
"August 8, 2019","I would advise that as soon as you arrive, you immediately visit the crown jewels as the queues become ridiculous very early!I was excited about the Beefeater tour, however, these are not small group tours as I’d expected but instead 100s of people following a Beefeater from spot to spot which felt a little hustle & bustley! I would instead recommend the audio guide, which was £14 per family, and to walk around the Tower at your leisure.Finally, take your own food and drinks! A can of Pepsi cost £3.50!",So much history
"August 7, 2019","Spent half a day here today and could have spent longer. Went on a beefeater tour with Spike #402 he was fantastic. We learnt a lot. Go early and see the crown jewels first, we practically walked right in, later the line gets to over an hour long. If you pre book tickets you have to swap them at the group booking office before admission. Great day, great history, can see why it's number 1 in London.",So much history!
"August 7, 2019","The Tower of London lives up to its expectations! The tour was full of information ranging from the plaques to the Beefeaters. The place is full of history and a must see for anyone interested in the history of London. Steve, Beefeater, was very friendly and funny when giving us a talk. The ravens aren’t as scary as people they think, they do not approach you unless you are approaching them, which you are encouraged to not do. Great exhibition of the Crown Jewels on display. Only disappointment was the little information regarding the story of the Princes in the Tower. On the whole a really good and insightful few hours at the Tower of London.",Wished we had more time.
"July 25, 2019","We went as part of a full day tour with many other stops, so we really only had less than two hours. We waited in line for at least 30 minutes to see the crown jewels. I feel like we needed at least another hour or more to see everything. There is a lot of history to see here. Would definitely recommend a visit.",Do the Yeoman Tour 
"August 2, 2019","We went just to see the Crown Jewels and ended up on the Yeoman tour.  Our guide was Scott Kelly, one of the youngest Beefeaters (#409) and by his own admission the most handsome. He was quite humorous (given the subject matter of The Tower) and knowledgeable.  Loved the tour and learning the history of The Tower. The grounds are easy to navigate as our the buildings. The ravens flying and squawking about are entertaining too.",Come early
"August 1, 2019",Come as early as you can and go all over the walls - so you can watch everything calmly. Next up - Crown Jewels. So in about 2 hours you will see everything before the arrival of the large masses of tourists.,What a place!
"July 31, 2019","I wasn't sure what to expect when my wife told me we had to go here. Wow! I was impressed. Walking audio tour was great! Listening to the yeoman warders at various points throughout was great! My son got recruited into one of the skits they were doing, which you guessed it, was great! Royal Armoury was impressive. I would say the only thing that didn't blow me away was the crown jewels, but it was still good to see them. We spent probably 4 or 5 hours here and enjoyed all of it!",Amazing!!
"July 30, 2019",Allow yourself a good 3 hours to visit the Tower of London.  It truly is a national treasure.  The tours and guides are amazing and there is so much history you will definitely learn a thing or two.  ,Worth a visit when in London but not for little children
"July 30, 2019","The title of the review is self explanatory. Let me put it this way. Do not take the children on the Beefeater tour (even though it is included in the entry ticket) for this place has one bloody history and the Beefeaters I suspect secretly enjoy recounting all that morbid history in graphic detail.  It seriously has one bloody history. It is therefore quite fitting that all the loot from the various nations including the Kohinoor from India and the Cullinan and the Star of Africa are displayed here in all its glory. As an aside, it definitely represents a very important part of the English history and is worth a visit.",Must See!
"July 29, 2019","The Tower of London is a must see! You should plan on spending around 3 hours touring the grounds and plan for a lot of stairs if you want to see it all. Also, I highly recommend you getting there right when it opens as it get very busy in the afternoons and the line for the Crown Jewels can be extremely long. We went first thing in the morning and didn't have to wait at all!",Wonderful tour and experience 
"July 28, 2019",The warders tour is awesome and the overall tour was well worth the price of admission. Would recomend booking in advance for groups to save a few £.,Great museum for good weather
"July 27, 2019","The museum was very entertaining for my nieces (7 & 10), my brother and myself (30s), and our parents (70s).We arrived at 2pm and there was no line to get in.  It was crowded on the inside, but the interior courtyard is large so it was still easy to get around.  There were lines for some of the main exhibits on the inside, mainly for the crown jewels.  The crown jewels line moved fast though and was worth the wait.The free Yeomen Warders tour they give ever half hour or so are very entertaining.  I would plan to start with this tour and then go off and see all the exhibits after.  Give yourself 3 hours to be safe, if your are with kids you may need a little more time.",Worth going to for a history lesson
"July 27, 2019","Went a on a Saturday in July. Need less to say, very crowded including tour groups. If you can stomach the crowds, it is worth going to. A Yeoman Warner tour (free with admission) was entertaining and informative. There is a lot to see here so read up ahead of time to pick what you want to see. Come early if you want to see the Crown Jewels, line was very long in the hot sun. We skipped it.The walk along the wall was interesting to give an overview of the place. The White tower museum has lots of arms and armor and also lots of steps.Would come back on a less crowded day to see the stuff we missed.",Amazing! 
"July 25, 2019","My family and I went here during our two day stay in London and it’s was absolutely fabulous! We purchased the London Passes and were brought straight in with no wait at all! There was a line for the Crown Jewels but the conveyer belts in front of them kept the line moving swiftly. All of the staff was more than kind and there were even some historically dressed employees performing re-enactments throughout the castle. The grounds were not overly crowded, so there was plenty of room to walk around and sit and relax between walking through the grounds. Overall the rooms were very nice and the signs were translated to many languages as to accommodate many people from many different regions, which is more than I can say about other historic castles, such as Versailles in France. It definitely takes a few hours to see everything, but it is well worth it! I definitely recommend this castle and would 100% return! ","The good, bad and ugly of England’s past"
"July 25, 2019","Only had a 2.5hr slot so we had to be choosy about what we went to - in truth you could spend the best part of a day exploring (which would make the price more palatable). Started with the tour which was well worth it (get close so you can hear clearly) - v knowledgeable and friendly guide. Then saw Crown Jewels (big queue but moved v quickly so we were in in minutes), the white tower armoury (cool weapons) and the torture instruments in the base of the tower. Fascinating stuff. My main improvement would be to bring in digital tickets (you HAVE to have a printed one) - as antiquated as the venue!!",Ravens!
"July 25, 2019","Enjoyed a guided tour of the Tower of London -- two highlights: seeing the famous Tower Ravens and the Crown Jewels. Imagine a diamond the size of my fist! The architecture is gorgeous, the museums fascinating. Well worth the visit. ",Amazing
"July 24, 2019","We only spent 3 hours here, not enough time to fully immerse ourselves. Crown jewels exhibit was breathtaking ",Really good
"July 24, 2019",Very informative the people were so helpful and we all enjoyed the experience. Well worth a visit!!It got a little pushy in the Crown Jewels but that’s people who are pushy and not the attractions fault. ,Don't book through Viator - book directly with location!
"July 23, 2019","We weren't able to get to the Tower of London on the day that I had I purchased our tickets for, so I called Viator to see if we could transfer to the next day. They told me they would have to hear from the property. I called the property and they said no problem just to tell Viator it was ok but after three phone calls and speaking to various ""customer service"" reps, Viator would not accept that. So, we lost the $105 we spent on tickets and never saw the Tower of London. London is a huge city that is difficult to navigate and the last tour runs at 5 so if you are stuck in traffic or you've had to alter plans due to an unforeseen circumstance, you are stuck. You are better off to buy them directly through the Tower of London for that day.",An incredible look into history 
"July 23, 2019","As someone who likes attractions a bit more off the beaten path, I was taken aback by how much I enjoyed visiting. To avoid the crowds at the Crown Jewels we arrived about ten minutes before opening in the morning and were promptly let in. We got through without any line. The other parts of the Tower were fascinating and much less crowded as the day went on than the Crown Jewels (By mid morning the line to see them wrapped nearly around the whole courtyard!). There also appeared to be many family friendly aspects of the grounds as well. ",It's Not a Tower
"July 23, 2019",Just a bit of humor.  The Tower of London grounds is an interesting spot with a complex and varied history. It has been more than just a place where disfavored royals were imprisoned.  I recall watching The White Princess with young Edward V & his brother disappearing after being imprisoned by their Uncle. It was seriously moving (surprisingly so) when they pointed out the spot where a 150 or so years later workmen found the skeletons of two boys in a box under a staircase.,A must visit 
"July 23, 2019","England is full of interesting history and the Tower of  London is a must visit. Viewing the crown jewels is worth the visit alone. And the tower bridge is right next to door, so include in your itinerary ",Brilliant family day out
"July 22, 2019","Fun for all ages. We really enjoyed ourselves and you can take a picnic which helps cut down costs, Often do special kids events in holidays. We bought a Historical Royal Palaces card as one off payment gives access to other sites for a year and loved idea of popping into Tower to drool over Crown Jewels as often as we wanted. Watch out for queues in July and August and buy tickets online.",Loved the Tower - Hated the Lines!
"July 6, 2019","First the good.  Our family really enjoyed our visit to the Tower of London.  There is a ton to see and a great deal of history within the walls.  We went just after opening and immediately went to see the Crown Jewels and had only a 10-15 minute wait to get in.  We went on the Beefeater Tour and our guide was excellent.  Funny, informative and good for both adults and kids.  We only had about 3 hours and could have used another hour to really see everything.  Definitely a must visit sight for anyone coming to London.The bad.  This ticket does NOT allow you to bypass the entrance line.  It ONLY allows you to bypass the ticket line.  When we got there the ticket lines were not that long and I'm not sure that this really had any value to us.  The line to enter the Tower was probably 1/3 of a mile long.  My wife and son got in line as soon as we arrived while my daughter and I got in line to get our tickets.  By the time we got our tickets (20-30 minutes) they were almost to the entrance and then we got right in.  It might have been that we were there when the Tower opened.  The lines to enter did not seem quite as bad when we left in the early afternoon.  Also, the Beefeater Tour is great but its not a private tour.  Our tour had around 50-60 people.  The guide managed it all very well and made sure we all could see and hear him but don't think you're getting a special tour with this ticket.  Overall, everyone should visit the Tower of London.  It's a fantastic part of London's history.  But be prepared for long lines and be aware of what this ticket is and is not.",Too crowded
"July 2, 2019","It was so below my expectations. The truth is what you see outside is what you get because its basically empty and way too crowded. Crown jewels and armor room are probably the best. Maybe I should have waited for the yeoman warder tour, because If you go on your own practically you dont get a clue of what the tower really was",The Tower of London
"July 2, 2019","This was my number 1 on the list for London and it did not disappoint. From the Crown Jewels. The Beefeaters, the ravens, the history of the place, it was wonderful. Do not miss this if you are going to London.",Very Interesting!
"July 2, 2019",There was so much to see it took the better part of the day so don't rush through.  And don't miss the Crown Jewels even if the line is long!  Jaw dropping!  ,Was I tired of museums?
"June 29, 2019",Perhaps I was tired of museums and audio guides but I didn’t enjoy the Tower of London as much as I thought I might. This tour might be great for medieval history buffs or royal watchers with a fascination for the Crown Jewels but it didn’t grab my attention. ,Landmark heavy on history
"June 26, 2019","The waiting lines may seem scary but they move rather quickly, just make sure you are waiting in the right one because the staff is not very helpful. Walking in this place you can feel the history, although I do feel they could have made a better presentation out of it. Wear comfortable shoes.",Insight into the mechanics
"June 25, 2019",Thoroughly enjoyed this tour to witness the mechanics up close on the bridge's operational features. Excellent how incorporating modern features of glass floor above Thames to capture events below. One of the best gift souvenir shops we uncovered at the end of tour . Quick exit back to Hop on off bus tour stop. Worth the entry for sure,Lousy cancellation plan.
"June 24, 2019","Tried to cancel one day ahead, no refunds. Travel companion was sick.  Lousy cancellation policy.  Out 100 pounds.....",The White Tower and Crown Jewels were amazing
"June 24, 2019",We arrived at 9:30 am on Sunday morning and waited in the group ticket line.  At 10 am they opened the ticket booths and the line moved quick.  They took our vouchers and gave us printed tickets.  The line to get into the tower gates was very long and it took another 25 minutes to get in.  Once in side you have to pay 5 pounds if you want audio guides.  We then waited another 20 minutes in another line for the crown jewels but it was worth it.  They were amazing to see and the flow of people moves well once inside.  The white tower was also amazing to see all the amour of past kings and other historical items.  The only thing we would do different is not go early in the morning since once we got outside the gates there we no lines any more.,A great way to spend half a day!
"June 24, 2019","This was a very interesting place to visit. We took the free guided tour that was included in the price of our ticket and it was great! Our guide was funny and very passionate about his job! Learnt a lot about the history of the castle and heard some crazy stories. Would certainly recommend going to London Tower. Oh and make sure you go and see the Crown Jewels, they were unbelievable!",Tower of London
"August 7, 2019","Going on a Saturday in Summer holidays I knew it would be busy but wow I think half of London was there. Beefeater Tour was informative but too many people so we opted to view the Crown Jewels. The queue was 30 minutes but well worth it. The queue after we came out was 1 hour, not ideal in the heat. We spent 3 hours in total and could have spent longer.",Family Trip
"August 7, 2019","We got there a little before 9 and waited in line for the Tower of London to open. We went straight to the Crown Jewels upon opening. The line was virtually non-existent for the jewels. We then returned to the front for the yeoman tour. However, there were SO many people for the tour, it was hard to get close enough to hear him. We wound up dropping out of the tour by the second stop.",Great place to see some royal stuff!!
"August 7, 2019",You must get here early...they start queuing up by mid morning and there is not a lot of shade in the outside line! Totally worth visiting as you can see a large assortment of the Royal Crown Jewels! Bonus...the guards outside are a hoot!! ,Fascinating look at London's history
"August 6, 2019","There is so much to see at the Tower of London. Do yourself a favour and join a guided tour - it's well worth doing to get a glimpse into the history of the tower and how it operates today. Be prepared for crowds and queues into the Crown Jewels by going earlier in the day, especially if you plan to go in peak season. I spent a few hours here exploring and really enjoyed the experience.",Fantastic!
"August 5, 2019","This was a great place to spend a good portion of a day. There was lots to see and we tired before we ran out of things to see.  It's a great place for families!  There can be lots of climbing and going down stairs and some areas might be difficult to transverse, but there is something here for everyone to enjoy.  There are also places to get food and drinks when hungry. We actually had no idea how large and accessible the Tower of London was, and that it's actually a huge castle and beautiful grounds. A ""must see"" in London! ",Yeoman’s Tour
"August 5, 2019","My 20 year old daughter and I found the Tower of London fascinating, although a bit gruesome.  The highlight was the Yeoman Warder’s Tour by Scott Kelley!  Even with quite a crowd around him, he projected his voice and kept everyone engaged.  We learned a lot!","Fantastic, something for everyone!"
"August 5, 2019","Really, timing is everything. Just took our kids and it was an absolute zoo, but they loved it. We (my husband and I) have been during the Fall and Spring, and there were zero lines, so that is the hard part about summer vacation. However, there really is something for everyone and I think boys and girls of all ages will enjoy it! Note, we went earlier in the day and the lines were significantly even longer when we left for a late lunch. Eat on the tower side for lunch, we made the mistake of walking across the bridge after to look for lunch and avoid some of the crowd, but there weren’t nearly as many options.",GIve yourself a full day
"August 5, 2019","Do not miss this, the Yeoman tour is fun and informative as are the other interactive tours. We didn't give ourselves enough time. To really get the most allow yourselves a full day. Andy was out Yeoman and he was brilliant, sorry Andy can't remember your last name. Can't recommend highly enough","Not a castle, but worth it!"
"August 4, 2019","London Tower is old. True! But apart from housing kings was also a prision and was built over the centuries. Dont expect a castle, BUT performers are all over the place telling the stories that happenned there. Walk around the wall and towers is cool. If you want to see the royal guards really close, this is the place. They are protecting the Royal Jewels that are exposed in this monument.",Good History Lesson
"August 3, 2019",Our family really enjoyed The Tower of London tour. There was a great deal of history to learn. The exhibits were well done. It paid off to get there early.,Lousy cancellation plan.

"June 24, 2019",Great place! Ideally you’ll need at least two hours at the tower... if I had the time I wild have stayed longer. The history is fascinating!,This place worth to visit
"June 21, 2019","I been in London many times. This time finally decide visit Tower of London as well. I really saticfy with time I spent there. Very good was 45 min tour with guide. Guide was very professional, told many interesting facts about the history. After this guide tour we took time to look around our own and buildings, exebithions were more interesting. I honestly recomend to start visit of tower with this guide tour.",So much amazing history!!
"June 21, 2019","I read many travel blogs in preparation for our visit to Tower of London, most of which said to plan to spend 3 hours or so. I felt like we could have planned an entire day! We arrived on a Sunday morning at 9:15am and were within the first 30 or so people in line, which quickly grew to hundreds. Upon entry, we went straight to the Crown Jewels, then doubled back for the Yeoman Warder guided tour. I do not remember his name, but he was fantastic! We will visit again on our next trip to London and plan to spend an entire day here. ",What fun!
"June 21, 2019","This is a must see! So much happened here and so much is housed here. If you love British history, this is a great place to visit The guides are great and very informative and friendly.",Vacation 
"June 21, 2019",EXTREMELY crowded. Lots of school tours and bus company tours and all day we felt like we were being rushed. I would suggest low peak times.,Absolutely fabulous 
"June 20, 2019","Worth the time. But get there early and see the crown jewels first. Then tour the rest. The audio tour was good, but if you can make time for the yarders tour. ",Ravens everywhere
"June 20, 2019",We had a lot of fun exploring this wonder.  We bought the London Pass and had front of the line access in the morning when we visited.  There are entertaining guided tours... but also fun to walk around and explore.,Lots of stairs but worth the trip 
"June 20, 2019",Don’t do this if you have poor mobility. There is a lot of walking up/down stairs. But the history is worth checking out as well as the Crown Jewels.,History brought to Life
"June 20, 2019","A wonderful experience especially if part of a presentation by The Yeomen Warders. They bring the history, past and present, to life with their knowledge, devotion to duty and respect for those who have been and still part of history. ",Brilliant trip - do not miss the Tower of London
"June 20, 2019","First off, don’t do it if you are thinking of skipping the Tower of London for _____ instead. It’s a wonderful combination of history, architecture, theater, drama, ravens, jewels, and armor. Main tip for going is to get there early! Start off with a coffee from a nearby shop and stand in line 15 minutes before opening. Once in, nab an audio tour and head quickly to the Crown Jewels exhibit. Do not get distracted on the way - zoom for the jewels exhibit and then take your time once in. 30 minutes after opening the wait for the jewels is long. An hour after opening and you might be in line for another hour.After that time it so you get the Beefeater tour. Drama, humor, and history done right. You can stroll the grounds and hit up the armory to your hearts content from there.",A great way to spend half a day!
"June 20, 2019","This was a very interesting place to visit. We took the free guided tour that was included in the price of our ticket and it was great!

"June 23, 2019","It was amazing to see the crown jewels!   The beefeaters were friendly and would answer any questions as well as allow pictures with them to be taken.  No pictures are allowed of the crown jewels, however can take plenty of the grounds and the guards and the beefeaters.  They had nice gift shops also.  There is a river cruise right about this also.",Excellent
"June 23, 2019","Arrived just as it opened, long line even then. The Crown Jewels are here however it's a small collection and no photography allowed. It was interesting to see all the history. Glad we arrived early because it got very crowded when we left by 11am.",Must see
"June 23, 2019","The Tower of London is a compound in the middle of London.  We took an early tour.  I highly recommend going early to avoid the crowds and see the beefeaters opening.  While the Crown Jewels section is small, it is very impressive.  This is the only section were pictures are not allowed.  There are multiple buildings to tour with paintings, weaponry, knights and some interactive games.  The ravens that live on property are very large. There are many things to see and plenty of photo opportunities.",Favorite sight!
"June 22, 2019","This was one of our favorite sights in the UK!! So rich in history and so wonderfully preserved! We used the audio tour, which I would highly recommend unless you know your history very well! We learned alot and couldn't believe the collections of historical pieces here. Make sure you get there at least 30 minutes before opening and get your tickets ahead of time. Once inside, get your audio tour headphones and head directly to the crown jewels! If you wait, the queue will be VERY long. We saw the jewels without waiting and were finished quickly so we could spend the rest of our time in the other areas. Who wants to wait 2 hours in a queue?!",Annual family day out. The culture bit.
"June 22, 2019",Bought tickets in advance. Was a beautiful day and thankfully no queuing to get in. Caught the tour for 11.30 with the beefeater. Far too many people gathered around to be able to hear. It needs to be kept in lower numbers. Beefeater Steve was  wet amusing when you could hear him. Halfway through wandered off a bit as just couldn’t make out what was being said. Lovely place to visit but needs more to control numbers do people benefit from the tours.,Very Cool
"June 22, 2019","Very glad we visited the Tower.   They offer guided tours given by a Beefeater, the talks are funny and informative.  Check the schedule when you get there it it worth it and is included in your admission.  We did the audio tour as well ( separate fee) but the Beefeater tour was much better.   The crown jewels are a must see while you are there but it can get a bit crowded.  You can spend more time there than you think, give yourself plenty of time.  Great views of Tower Bridge from the Tower Courtyard.  ",Absolutely fantastic! 
"June 21, 2019","Went with my two boys ages 3 & 6, & they both LOVED it! Friendly employees all around. There was a very kind gentleman who sat in an information booth around the middle of the grounds and gave my boys each a cute little button that said “I escaped the tower” (or something very close to that). So cute! And they thought they were hot stuff! There are also great views of The Shard and Tower Bridge from within & you can skip the ticket line with your London Pass. This was my absolute favorite thing in London!!! ",Icon of London you had to visit
"June 6, 2019",This and the tower bridge are two of the best known landmarks in London. The 22 pounds it cost to visit was well worth it. You could spend the whole day there - although an hour of that time would be spent queuing up to see the amazing crown jewels! There are a lot of tourists there! The queue was about half a kilometre long the whole time we were there. But all in all a must see . There is also plenty of other historical things to see and the beefeaters tell a very good yarn.,Tower of London
"June 6, 2019",Loved this! Have been to London several times and never did this. Went early and headed for crowned jewels first before a line. Then went back to the front to join in on a free tour. That was awesome! So informative!  Really enjoyed this - five stars!!,London’s Best Historical Site
"June 6, 2019","With its origins dating back to the 11th century and William the Conqueror, this place has seen a lot. Infamous for its executions and famous for its guarding of the Crown Jewels, the highlight for me was the walk around/through the garrisons. There you learned what life (and death) was like for this who lived, worked, and died there. Tip: I suggest you A) Buy your tickets in advanceB) Line up 30 mins before it opensC) Enter and go straight to the Crown Jewels. We walked right through with no crowd or line. Huge queues later in the day. D) Join a beefeater tour. These official guards are great guides. They share a 45 minute history of the Tower in a humorous and fun way. E) Explore the White Tower and walk along/through the garrisons. ",A Must See
"June 6, 2019",Very entertaining with a lot to see and learn about.  Really much of London's history starts here and allow a couple of hours.,Lots to see
"June 5, 2019","Bought tickets online and picked up at will call - pretty easy process.  The line was super long when they first opened - we came back a few hours later and there was no line.  This was a really cool place to tour , so much to see.  They had people dressed in timely outfits and engaging in scenes - it was cool So much history and cool architecture.  There wasn’t a line to get in but once inside there is another line to see the Crown Jewels - that was insanely long. Decided not to wait in that since our time was limited in London.  Even without seeing those it was well worth the tour.  They do have a room with previous crowns with the jewels removed and those were pretty cool to see too.  You could go through the whole thing pretty quickly or spend hours there.  ",History Comes Alive
"June 5, 2019","We spent hours here and it's worth the price. There is so much British history in the walls and it is great to walk around and take it all in. The crown jewels are really interesting to see, but I recommend getting in line earlier in the day as the line gets longer later. There are plenty of exhibits about the various history and families in the castle. Some of the exhibits are updated and some are definitely older. You'll spend about three hours here taking it all in.",The Crown Jewels
"June 5, 2019",We visited Tower of London on a Tuesday and the crowds weren't to bad....there were quiet a few schools there on field trips.  You can spend a lot of time here going into each room.  We were on a bit of a time limit so we hit the highlights...including The Crown Jewels.  This exhibit is absolutely amazing!,Nice Tower 
"June 4, 2019",Get there early and it is worth it. We went at 930 on Saturday and it was wonderful. The dungeons are fun and the walk around the tower wall is neat. You go up some cool stairscases and see some interesting things. I enjoyed it. The crown jewels are pretty spectacular.  When we walked out around 1130 and it was a madhouse. I don't think it would have been much fun. ,Lots of visitors on a Sunday
"June 4, 2019","Looooong line on Sunday for tickets and to enter. Once inside, go directly to the Crown Jewels or else you will end up in another looooong line as everyone ends up there. The Crown Jewels are amazing and worth the visit! The Beefeaters did some talks aroung the grounds but were hard for us to understand. Also, some people dressed in period costumes did talks as well, but were also difficult for us to hear and understand. We probably needed more time talking to folks in pubs to decipher the lingo.",Family visit
"June 3, 2019","The first time I had ever done this tour. Went with my wife and grown up kids. What a fantastic experience. So interesting. Lots to see and learn, but the highlight for me had to be the beefeater tour. Absolutely hilarious. These guys made for a fantastic day. Would recommend to anyone.",Fortress with glorious past
"June 1, 2019","The Tower of London was part of the places we planned to visit in London and turned out to be an excellent choice.We paid 31£ (5£ was the donation) and followed a Yeoman Warder which guided us in the Tower.Place of imprisonment and murders shows that kings and Princess have also hard lives.The Imperial State,The Chapel of St John Evangelist,The bloody Tower ,The Royal Armouries are few parts that worth to be visited.We needed about 4 hours to see it all.",Tour worth your time & overall a must-visit if in London
"May 30, 2019","Like everyone says - the ""beefeater"" or Yeoman Warders tour is really worth your time.  The guides are actual Yeoman Warders - or guarders of the Queen - a very high honor within the Royal Military.  The YW live in the Tower of London - in a flat - and really have a passion for the history of the TOL.There is a lot to explore here, from the Crown Jewels to the war museum - we spent a little over 3 hours here touring around.  I would recommend getting the ""membership"" - it's ~82 pounds for a joint membership.  By visiting just the Kensington Palace and the TOL, it pays for itself.  Plus you get access to a few other Palaces around London (accessible by train/tube) and the Banqueting House.",Tower of London visit
"May 30, 2019","It had been thirty years since my last visit here, so not much had changed...but my husband had not been.I loved the history story’s told by the Yeoman guard, but he did tend to waffle on a bit about the football too much!Once we toured the other parts of the museum, the line was too long to see the Crown Jewels and as it was raining quite heavily, we missed out on that part...a little disappointing actually!It is quite expensive, you think they would have worked out a better system to get to see the Jewels when it’s school holidays?",It didn’t disappoint 
"May 29, 2019","It’s the Crown Jewels, what else can I say? It’s a lot to see and there it also a lot of information available about the jewelry. There is lots about prisoners that have been in the Tower of London and the torture devices and how the devices where used. ",Tower of London tour
"May 29, 2019",Thoroughly enjoyed the Beefeater tour at the tower today led by Scott Kelly!! Very knowledgeable and entertaining.  The jewels were stunning and the grounds were pristine!! Such a fun and memorable day.,Fantastic tour and guide
"May 29, 2019","Recommend you take one of the guided tours, I think the last one is about 15:30. Well worth it, the guide was very entertaining and informative.",Visiting here was lovely
"May 29, 2019","Start with purchasing tickets in advance. Take the tour with a guide, then explore all there is available. Some queues were long, but moved at a steady pace. Stairs can be tricky, just take your time. The Crown Jewels are breath-taking.", Fascinating history inside those walls 
"May 28, 2019","The tower was what I expected.  Eerie, yet grand.  The Crown Jewels were as excessive and glitzy as the royal monarchy. ",Amazing to see
"May 28, 2019",By far one of the highlights of my trip. The Crown Jewels are something everyone should see. Amazing! The grounds are beautiful too. Well worth the time to tour it.,Wonderful Time!
"May 28, 2019",We had a fabulous time at the Tower!  Especially enjoyed the yeoman Warder tour— a very entertaining way to see the Tower and learn its history!  Lots for everyone in the family to see and do! ,Go in the morning
"August 25, 2021",Got a 15.00 entry but this is to late to get round everything as it starts shutting down at 5.00 so they can close the gate at 6.00 worth a visit but have an entry at 13.00 at the latest,Totally recommend this
"August 25, 2021","Amazing - we have never done this before and it’s so worth it - the beefeaters were funny and so informative. Beautiful place, gardens and surround, Crown Jewels were so beautiful and I even managed a visit to the little church where Anne Boleyn is laid to rest. Great experience ! The kids enjoyed themselves to and didn’t get bored so it was perfect.  Well signposted to.",Great day out with family
"August 24, 2021","Booked tickets online for a day out with the family whilst in London for 5 nights.  Very much enjoyed!The queue for the Crown Jewels looked pretty big, but went down very quickly.","Enjoyed it, would recommend"
"August 24, 2021","Took my 6 year old son, who has developed an interest in castles recently. We're from the north, and spending a day in London on our way to Legoland, so had to choose from the many activities the capital offers, but we chose well. Enjoyed the visit, and my son loved it. You can get very close to the crown jewels in their glass cabinets (unlike, for example, the Mona Lisa in Paris). I really enjoyed the beefeater tour and would recommend it. I think ours was called Mark, he was entertaining and funny, but also full of stories from history. The one criticism I had was that it was pretty gory, and there were young children in the audience.",Well worth the money
"August 23, 2021","You go to the Tower primarily to see the Crown Jewels. They are beautifully presented and it is amazing how close you can get to them. They are well-lit, which makes the jewels sparkle. We visited on a Sunday morning in August 21, so there weren't many international tourists so we walked straight in and spent a long time looking at the jewels without crowds; looking at the queuing system in place I think it must get quite busy.The rest of the grounds are good too- I was surprised at how much you get to look around.Many of the Warders are very friendly and helpful but I think some of them are a bit 'clever' and full of themselves. One of them scoffed at my daughter's request for directions as it appeared obvious, but when he realised he was in the wrong because of the Tower's Covid restrictions in place, he 'wound his neck in', to use a military expression.",An excellent experience
"August 23, 2021","We visited for the ceremony of the keys where the tower is locked up for the night. This is after the tower is closed to the public and is a guided visit with in our case about 20 people.It was a fascinating experience which made me realise that royal ceremonies cary on whether any one is watching or not, in this ones case for each day for over 700 years.It was made special by the yeoman warden (acting as a guide) who was both informative and humorous.One thing to note is that the paths are cobbled so not the easiest to walk on.If afterwards you want to get a taxi you need to arrange a car to pick you up afterwards.There is a taxi rank opposite the entrance but no taxis and trying to flag a taxi down at that time of night is nigh on impossible.",Tower of London
"August 23, 2021",10/10 experience. Minimal wiring. Very interesting. Cannot recommend enough. The Guards (Guides) were funny aswel as informative. Great views of the city from the tower walls.,Tower of London visit 
"August 23, 2021","Fab place to visit. Enjoyed the jewels, stories and buildings. Easy to book and well organised inside. Need a minimum of three hours for a visit. ",Fabulous historical day out
"August 23, 2021","Amazing if you love history, and the Crown Jewels were fantastic. Well organised and didn’t feel too crowded",Fantastic day out full of history - highly recommend
"August 23, 2021",Fantastic day out in London - highly recommend doing a guided tour by one of the Beefeaters- they are free to do and absolutely brilliant. The history here is amazing and the Crown Jewels are truly spectacular to see.,Scott Kelly is an amazing Yeomen warder tour guide!
"February 14, 2019","Yeomen warder (Beefeater), Scott Kelly, was our 2pm tour guide and was so informative, creative, funny and a mesmerizing story teller!!  At the end of our tour, we found out we were only his 6th tour he has done and we were all shocked!!! He knew so much and truly appeared to love his job!!  He has been a beefeater only 6 months! Thank you for making our Tower of London tour so memorable and fun!!",Something one must do in life
"February 6, 2019","You haven't lived until you have heard the Beefeaters tell the story of the Tower. It is a little pricey and we have sat it out a few times, while out first-time travel companions, went on the tour. But we have done it 3 or 4 times, and have always loved it. Not to be missed for first-time visitors. Long lines in summer.",Interesting for the entire family
"February 5, 2019","Have bought ticket a month ago via internet and that was a great idea, did not have to wait:-)Great experience, very interesting, especially with their guide who is very witty :-) Need at least 2 hrs for sightseeing, enjoy :-)",When you go matters
"January 31, 2019","We have visited the Tower before but it was many years ago and my memory of it had faded.  We were in London in the middle of January prior to a cruise out of Tilbury and it felt as if we had the Tower almost to ourselves.  It was obvious that they experience crushing crowds when the weather is nicer, so be prepared for that.  I had read that military discounts were available and was pleased to discover that they afforded those discounts to Yanks.  Near the entry (inside) one can join a Warder tour.  These tour are by the Beefeaters and run every half an hour on the half hour.  They don't go everywhere, but do cover a number of the highlights.  It's easy to join and leave those tours at will, which we did.  Since our last visit they've installed moving sidewalks along both sides of the crown jewels display.  It's possible to go on both sides when it's not crowded, which we did, but I suspect it would be extremely difficult when crowded.  If you have to pick a side, I think the one on the right is slightly better, but only slightly, so if there's no one going to the left, and you're in a rush, pick that side.  In addition to the jewels we went to the Fusilier Museum.  It has some hands-on exhibits and some exhibits that are probably only meaningful if you were a Fusilier or had one in your close family.  We also went through the Medieval Castle and I give it a meh.  It didn't take us very long but I don't feel like I would have missed anything had we not gone.  It's very sparse in terms of exhibits.  We went in the chapel which I understand is not always available for tours.  You have to do that as part of a Warder tour.  Again, there's nothing particularly special about the décor of the chapel, though you do get to sit down while the Warder talks about its history.  Finally, I really enjoyed the wire sculptures that are new since my prior visit.  I particularly liked the baboons on the North Battlements and the elephant.  Photos are attached.Travel tips:  1.  Buy tickets in advance; 2.  Allow at least four hours for your visit, longer if you want to see everything.Thanks for reading.

"January 30, 2019","I've been to the Tower many times, but recently was the recipient of a special treat: an afterhours private tour (for 30-40 guests) and the Ceremony of the Keys.  Visiting the Tower, after closure and without the crowds, allows one to feel the power and the history in this amazing place: it could be the dark or the ghosts or just the awe-inspiring feeling one gets from realizing the amazing near-1,000 year history.  Following the tour, the Ceremony of the Keys is witnessed.  This changing of the guard and keys dates back 700 years, occurring at the same time every evening.  The tour concludes with drinks at The Keys Pub, run for and by the Yeomen Warders.  It is a great opportunity to meet one of the “Beefeaters” in their own environment and learn about their fascinating history.  Seeing the Tower during the daytime is a must so as not to miss the White Tower, Crown Jewels, etc. but the Ceremony of the Keys is a one-of-a-kind experience.  Reservations are necessary, and the earlier made the better.",Educative
"January 26, 2019",It was a interesting experience. Built well and structured well.  A once visit good. Visited with young adults.,Great experience
"January 25, 2019",Another great sight to visit. The Beefeater tour is can not miss and get there early to visit the crown jewels. We arrived at 10:00 AM which is when it opens and went right to the crown jewels and it was empty. It took us three hours to get through the self tour. Very interesing,Tower of London still amazing 
"January 23, 2019",A visit to the Tower of London is a must if visiting London. The complex is large and offers many excellent views of the City and the River Thames. The Crown Jewels display is breathtaking. The White Tower has an extensive showing of armour and weapons. The on-site Cafe is excellent. Good tasty food and not to expensive. The famous Crows and Beefeaters add to the visit.,Very rude staff 
"January 21, 2019","Shame shame shame that the employees don’t realise the impact of their behaviour and attitude on tourism in London. People at the gate were as cold as ice answering questions. One of the guards assigned for one area of the Tower of London wanted to call police on us because we wanted to enter the exhibit room 15 min before the closing time.... and the way he talked to us! Wow as we were pieces of dirt, meanwhile we paid £50 for our tickets what pay his salary. If he doesn’t want to do his job he should stay home and collect unemployment. I live in London but will never take any visitors there again as I don’t want to risk having a spoiled day. ",Interesting
"January 18, 2019","If you pre-purchase tickets online, you collect them at the group ticket line up, however signage is poor and we wasted a good 40 minutes lining in the wrong queue. The escalator around the crown jewels kept people moving and was a great idea! The queue for seeing these was long but it did keep moving. Photographing the ravens kept us busy while lining up. There was much to see at the Tower, but it was very busy and we were over lining up and tired. Suggest you go early in the morning - it is a full day's outing. ",Do not miss the opportunity to visit this amazing piece of history
"October 15, 2018","I had not been to the Tower of London in over twenty years. The history of the Tower and the Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula within the walls is unbelievable. To walk the Tower and the inner courtyard where kings and queens lived for hundreds of years is unbelievable. If you only have time to visit one landmark within the city, make this the one you choose.",Great visit.  Great guides
"October 14, 2018",Worth seeing.  Excellent history to see.  Crown jewels crowded but the crowd moved good.  Worth the visit for sure,It's a guy thing - except for the jewels
"October 14, 2018",It was a pretty interesting place to see.  I think guys like it better because of the armour and weapons.  I like the jewels - incredible to see.  A definite if you have time.,Rainy day at Tower of London
"October 12, 2018","England has a long Royal history. Tower of London is like a small village with its own community. Amazing architecture, medival palace, crown jewels, prisoner execution place, chapel. Learn the line of Kings who stay in the Palace. Extravagant  life style. We visited on a rainy day and not many shelter area. Remind all london visiting friends to put a small umbrella on your bag at all time. If you have a London pass will be able to enter without queuing. You can purchase online. A good deal for you to enjoy your london sightseeing in a discounted price. Enjoy your trip! Dont miss it. ",Family visit to the Tower of London 
"October 10, 2018",We visited the Tower of London as a family and had an amazing time. It was such a great learning experience for our 8 and 11 year old girls and for us! We had been here before without children and would recommend it as a top sight in London for any visitor. ,Absolutely excellent!!
"October 9, 2018","We used our LNER train tickets to get 2for 1 admission, this makes a trip fantastic value for money.We joined a tour by one of the Beefeaters called Mark, well from the very start he was hilarious, he made the history of the Tower very interesting and is a fantastic asset to this establishment. The whole tour and visit was excellent and well worth a visit.",UK history
"October 9, 2018","I loved this place. It is full of history. Visiting in October is quite pleasant. Weather was great and not too crowded. We arrived early and there was no wait for the Crown Jewels. We also saw exhibitions on torture, the ravens and the guided tour. However, as a non-native speaker, I found the guided tour a little difficult to understand. I would recommend the audio tour if you have trouble understanding accented English.",Holy crap this place is cool
"October 6, 2018",With deep history seated in the foundations of England monarchy this place blew us away. It’s hard to believe the age of this venue and the extent to which it helped form today’s world. The free tour was worth the wait when we first arrived - highly recommend taking the time to be on one of these tours. All the stories from monarchs to ravens to the zoo provided a great sense of the importance of the Tower. The Crown Jewels exhibit was stunning - but would have been nice to take pictures. Overall a very memorable attraction.,Rich History
"October 6, 2018",I was plesently surprised by this attraction.  I honestly had no idea about what this was before gaining admission through our London Pass.  There are guided tours which I highly recommend that tell you the history of the Tower leading into the tower.  Then end of the guided tour will leave you in the cathedral where the public is halted from admission until the tour is over (around 45 mins).  From there you can use the audio guide to explore on your own.  The main attraction is the crown jewels which can queue very quickly.  The lines move steadily but make sure you don't miss out on that!  I highly recommend this attraction seeing as it plays a huge part in history.,Well organized interesting historical site
"October 4, 2018",Nice free guided tours - full of humor and history. Impressive presentation of Crown Jewels. After the visit you can walk over the Tower Bridge to the south bank of Thames river,Excellant part of history
"October 2, 2018",The tower of London is a excellent part of history to see. The crown jewels were the best part. The rest is a typical castle and tower similar to what you see around Britain.,Who goes to London and doesn't visit the jewels?
"September 30, 2018","Not saying you can't go through life without doing so, but I wouldn't recommend London without recommending the Tower of London and the Crown Jewels. You're seeing a part of past and present intertwined, all the time marveling at the majesty of it all. From the craftsmanship of the jewels to the construction of the buildings. Also very striking to see such and old and historic landmark in the midst of a modern and vibrant metropolis. I recommend you visit. ","Must see in London, skip torture areas with small kids"
"September 25, 2018","The Tower of London is a must see on most lists, and I'd agree.  Watch the lines to see the Crown Jewels.  They can get really long, although they ebb and flow throughout the day, I'd opt to do those early or near the end of the day.  The line moves faster than the signs say.  I'd also take the time to see the video of the coronation in the Crown Jewels area even though the line continues to move.  Step out of line, sit down and take 5 minutes to watch.  It gives a lot of context for what you will see shortly.  It makes it more real, especially for kids.  Also, if you have small kids, you may want to skip the Bloody Tower.  There are enough jails and references to prisoners without it.  Be sure to walk the tower walls along the outside for a great view of the Thames and the Tower Bridge.  ",What fun- The Beefeatets
"September 23, 2018",This would have been just another typical historical outing if not for the Beefeaters!  They brought the history of the tower to life and with humor.  This was my first tour upon arriving and much jet lagged so didn’t linger and read up or explore other areas.  Certainly a not to miss site but only if you take the tour with the Beefeater!,Off With Their Heads
"September 20, 2018",I felt like I was stepping back in time when I entered this complex of Roman to modern historical buildings.  There’s so much to see here that it would be well worth doing a two-day tour.  The Tower ravens and the Beefeaters were added bonuses that I hadn’t anticipated seeing.  ,Fascinating history & those Crown Jewels!!!
"September 18, 2018","Wonderful historical setting and the museum of armor is really worth seeing!  Be sure to take the free tour by the Warders (those guys in the Beefeater outfits.)  Funny, informative and really, really interesting.  The Crown Jewels are incredible as is the overall experience!",Amazing
"September 14, 2018","I loved the Tower of London. It was so beautiful and interesting. There was so much to see and do. If I had more time, I could definitely spend hours and hours there. The Crown Jewels were definitely a highlight. ",Great tour!
"September 8, 2018",Loved this guided tour with the Beefeater!  Enjoyed hearing historical perspectives. Saw all key sites as a group and then took time to see the Crown Jewels as well ,Amazing Tour
"September 8, 2018","We absolutely enjoyed our tour of the Tower of London. We started in the moat with a Beefeater learning about the their history and the Tower of London’s history. How amazing this place is and so informative and intriguing. I never knew all of this English history, and we just loved learning and visually taking it all in. The Crown Jewels were magnificent. This tour was one of the highlights of our visit to London. Don’t hesitate to take this tour. We went on a Monday and the lines were very short and we easily went through it all in less that 3 hours. Don’t miss the first hour of the tour with a distinguished Beefeatter, he was so humorous and impressive. I did not know that a Beefeater or Yeoman Warder must meet the highest of standards. They must have served for at least 22 years in the armed services, be a former warrant officer or senior non commissioned plus hold the long service and good conduct medal. Amazing men and yes a few women of these high standards share a wealth of knowledge with grace and dignity. It was truly outstanding.",Tower of London
"September 5, 2018",A Must see! A Great view of a famous landmark! Memorial of the crew who built the bridge was touching!,Pinnacle of our visit
"August 27, 2018","We took the tube to the Tower of London from our location in Paddington. There were not huge crowds at the ticket office, but once inside, tons of people. The priority was to see the Crown Jewels and there was a huge line (at about 11:00 am on a weekday) but the line seemed to move quickly and there was good people watching while we waited. Inside the Tower of London, there were many artifacts on the walls as well as a chronology of historical events that make the Tower such an interesting place to visit. No photos are allowed inside. There was a conveyor sidewalk when you finally reach the Crown Jewels so you can't just stand there for hours (and drool!). I finished one side of the conveyor and then jumped on the other side so I could view every aspect of the jewels. They were magnificent and well worth the wait. From there, we took in part of the live theatre in the Last Days of Anne Boleyn and were drawn to the accompanying musicians. We toured the Fusilier Museum and viewed the history of this Royal Regiment from 1685 until present day. There's a fairly large food court where a variety of hot and cold refreshments are available.  I got the Fish and Chips and they were excellent and a good value. We continued to walk around and found our way to the Torture Dungeon to visit the ancient tools of punishment.  The London Bridge is close by and a nice fellow from Australia offered to take our photo with the Bridge behind us.  Nice. We would have liked to have taken the free guided tour but ran out of time and energy. I bought the Tower of London Book so can read all about it. This is a quintessential sight to see if you are in London. Highly recommend, but if you can avoid the mass of fellow tourists, that would be the best way to experience it. You can get a wi-fi headset if you want to know all the details.",Highlight of our trip!!!
"August 27, 2018","My family of 4 (2 young teens) LOVED the Tower or London.  A definite highlight of our trip!  Our Beefeater/Warden was excellent and we all learned so much!  We got there at opening and did the crown jewels first - no line!  Then we went for the 10am Beefeater tour, and while we started out with 40-50 people in our group a lot wandered off as we moved from place to place.  Hint: don't wander off!  I wish every tour guide was this fascinating and funny!!!!  Plus, the Tower itself is just really cool. ",Stunning!
"August 27, 2018","Hours upon hours could be spent here, viewing the crown jewels, art collection, armory, architecture, and more.As with St. Paul's Cathedral and Windsor Castle, order your tickets in advance from your hotel's concierge to avoid waiting in very long  queues.",Must See Tower of London
"August 27, 2018","If you can only visit one historic site in London you have to make it the Tower of London especially if you have kids. It's an amazing place with tons of very interesting history.  The Yeoman Warder tour is absolutely a must. These warders are extremely interesting, knowledgeable and FUNNY.  The Crown Jewels are amazing. Get there early before the long lines in the summer.",History preserved
"August 26, 2018",This is always a favourite when we are in London.  So much history and the tours make it come alive.  Just walking through this amazing group of buildings is breathtaking.,Well worth a visit
"August 25, 2018","We visited the tower today and a great day was had by us all. We joined the 13.30 tour, guided by Yeoman Spike Abbott, it was an informative and engaging tour. Spike was extremely knowledgeable and keen to share the tower's history, all of which was delivered with good humour. We were lucky enough to chat to Spike after the tour, where he was happy to answer our many questions. His passion and dedication was infectious. If you're lucky enough to join a tour hosted by Yeoman 402 you are guaranteed a great time.",Great Views
"August 23, 2018","This is a quick trip but definitely worth it! You get some great shots of the city and when inside, you also can see all the other bridges (photos of the them) from around the world. ",Crown jewels and other royal treasures
"August 22, 2018","Buy tickets online ahead of time and go early to beat the crowd.  Start with the Crown Jewel (again, beat the crowd). That’s the one that gets busiest. Join the yeoman tour that starts at the moat by the entrance. The yeoman tour was entertaining and informative. If going to Tower Bridge, go to the Tower of London first.","""Off with their heads"""
"August 22, 2018","A fabulous day out. Bought my tickets online so slightly easier to go in, however ticket line wasn't too long at 11am. Beefeaters/Yeoman were obviously amazing with the tourists for photos and very helpful. Answering questions without hesitation. The Bearskin soldiers were also there rigid selves... exactly as they should be. Wearing all that on a hot day without fuss.. yes they are trained but treat them with respect. The crown jewels are beautiful and loved the travellator to go past them. Kept the flow going. Shame that didn't carry in past the other items displayed. We spent a good 4 hours there. Thoroughly enjoyed it... won't say too much though as don't want to ruin your trip.",Guided Tour by Yeoman of the Guard
"August 21, 2018",An entertaining and very informative tour by Clive. Packed with historical facts and amusing stories that kept the large crowd’s attention for an hour. The tour was free and leaves every half hour from the entrance. Well worth joining- thank you Clive!,Read for Pro-Tips: The Heart of England...Of Course See It.
"November 8, 2018","The history of this place and the crown jewels make this your first stop when visiting London.  Here are your pro-tips.  The facility is large and there are some uneven walks.  And a few steep stairs.  Take comfortable shoes.  Take your camera...grab a raven picture.  It's crazy busy, so plan your timing for off-peak as much as possible.  The beefeaters offer free tours and they are worth your time.  Plan two hours for a visit and do not forget to take pictures.  This place is special.",Go EARLY!
"November 7, 2018",We went on a Wednesday morning (around 10 am) with no waiting..from buying tickets to going through the security procedure. Consider visiting the Crown Jewels first because the line is very long to get into the building. The audible tour is very good...it allows you to take your time and linger at certain sites. The Yeoman Waders (Beefeaters) tour is included with your admission....but they do not limit the number of people on the walking tour so we had a very large group of people so at times it was difficult to hear what he was saying...if you can stay close to your guide. ,What a great historic adventure.
"November 6, 2018","We visited the Tower of London on our recent trip to the UK, and were more than impressed. There is so much to see & do here. We did a tour with a Beefeater Yeoman. He was so knowledgeable and the stories he told were so interesting, touched with humour and suitable for all ages.There is plenty here for the history buff as well as the interested onlooker, but be sure to give yourself plenty of time, because there is loads to see. My advice is to arrive early.The Crown Jewels are just magnificent as is the display of weaponry through the ages. The memorial at the site of Anne Boleyn's execution is quite thought provoking and beautiful. The ravens and their story, make interesting listening as does the visit to Traitor's Gate.If after all these tales of blood & gore you are hungry, the cafeteria is well stoked with comfortable tables & chairs and caters for all diets.My advice: The Tower of London: Don't miss it !",Beefeater Yeoman and Crown Jewels
"November 6, 2018",Purchase tickets in advance on line and pick up at the group will call window. This saves you a fair number of pounds. Arrive early and take the free tour with the Yeoman. They are spirited and funny and provide a great overview of the Tower of London. If  there are crowds head straight fo the Crown Jewels and then go back to the start and join a Yeoman tour. You will get a lot more out of the Beefeaters tour than roaming around by yourself.,History excellence
"November 6, 2018","The amazing collection of the history of the English monarchs great architecture, beautiful art collection.",History comes alive
"November 6, 2018","If you are into history, skulduggery, kings and queens, castles, this is a great place to visit.  You can walk around the outside of the tower of if you want to brave the crowds, venture inside where the Crown jewels are held.  ",Crown Jewels
"November 5, 2018","Great couple of hours, we went there specifically for the crown jewels and armory. The place is packed with interesting history.",Extensive complex of buildings with rich history
"November 4, 2018","This is a vast collection of historic buildings with masses of history.  I recommend paying the extra 5 pounds to get the audio guide, it was definitely worth it.",Wonderful History
"November 4, 2018","The Yeoman, Clive, made all the difference in learning about the history of the Tower. Humorous, yet factual, timeline of the use of the buildings,  providing a great hour long tour. And the Crown Jewels laid out in their splendor! Wow, beautiful!",Crown jewels!
"October 28, 2018",Can't go to London without seeing the Tower of London. We went on a weekday and encountered student groups. We heard about the history and saw the amazing crown jewels. Wow...,Coped with crowds 
"August 12, 2018","It was extremely busy being a Sunday in August. Line was almost around the block but moved fast once open. If you can, get your ticket online and take a printout so you dont have to wait in ticket line. Arrive early also. Once inside, do the crown jewels first to avoid the ever increasing line. Enjoyable.",Multigenerational group loved it. 
"August 9, 2018",Our group ranged from 11 to 80 years old. There was something of interest for everyone. We did this as an added ticket to the Big Bus tour and it was perfect. ,Step back in time...
"August 8, 2018","The Tower of London is one of my favorite places to visit in London. There's so much history there, and the Beefeaters are not just knowledgable, they're also entertaining. Our 10 yr old daughter had a great time working on the puzzle/mystery that they set up for families, and also really enjoyed the hands-on exhibits in the top floor of the castle. And of course, you can't go to the Tower without seeing the fabulous Crown Jewels! The one ""negative"" I'd say is the on-site cafe; the food was a little pricey, and not very good. If you can, probably best to eat elsewhere.",It was a lifelong dream to see this...
"August 7, 2018","I love history, especially English history, and going to the Tower of London thrilled me. This is a beautiful, fascinating place, full of secrets, life, and death. Seeing Traitor's Gate gave me goosebumps, likewise the execution site on Tower Hill. Since I was quite young I have loved to read information about British kings and queens, and knowing I was walking in the footsteps of many of them took my breath away. Seeing the Queen's Jewels, the ancient armor in the White Tower, just feeling the ambience of the old buildings (some 800 years old--amazing!) left me speechless. There were places to eat, benches to sit and rest, but so much to see we could have easily spent several more hours there. Easy to get to from the Tube. I highly recommend seeing this if you're in London! (There are some tours you can sign up for once you're there, but we wanted to do it on our own.)",Great experience
"August 5, 2018",This was amazing.  My ultimate goal was to see the Crown Jewels and boy was it fantastic.  A must see for anyone.,MUST-VISIT
"August 4, 2018","One of my favorite (if not favorite) tour of all-time. The ""tower"" has tremendous history. Take the live tour delivered by a beef eater guard. Visit the dungeon, the crown jewels, the prisoner water entrance, see where heads were removed from people's bodies, visit the chapel, and visit the white tower with all the armor. Henry VIII's ""form-fitting"" armor is a must. Walk around and give yourself about 2-3 hours to check out all the sights. Walk over to the tower bridge after visiting. Walk along the Thames. It's a great place - Must-do!",Beefeaters Rock
"August 4, 2018","Went first thing in the morning with our small Rick Steve’s tour group. We were told to go straight to the Crown Jewels and then go back to join a Beefeater tour. That’s what we did. Line for the jewels was minimal, but by the time we exited it was backed up to the sign saying it was 45 min wait. Then circled back to the meeting spot for the beefeater tour. Great tour with enough beheading to keep our teen boys interested. After that we went upstairs along the top of the wall. Great spot for pictures with the bridge in the background. ",Great visit first thing in the morning
"August 1, 2018","We arrived just before opening and went straight to the front of the line as I had purchased tickets beforehand online. After entering, we went straight to the crown jewels and had them all to ourselves for quite a long time. Later, we saw thousands standing in line outside in the hot sun.After the crown jewels, we took a beefeater tour which was absolutely fantastic! Great stories, great history, great laughs! Thoroughly enjoyed all our time there.",If there is one tourist trap to go to...
"July 30, 2018","This would be my pick. If you MUST see the crown jewels, note the queue is LONG and continues inside the building. Advised to join a free tour with one of the Beefeaters... knowledgeable and ammusing. I read you can reenter on the same day but we didnt try...",A London highlight
"July 28, 2018","This is one of those obvious tourist top ten locations, and it's well worth a visit. I'd been before, years ago, but this time I took my son and a friend from Paris. We were able to get into the Crown Jewels and the armoured pretty easily, and loved the Crown Jewels. It was a hot day and we were able to move around without any problems to find cooler places. It's always going to be busy, but it covers a huge area and there's something if interest to see wherever you go. We booked in advance online and that worked well.",Almost one thousand years of history in the heart of London
"July 11, 2018","It is a magic place full of intriguing stories of torture and death of important and not so important characters in England History. It is also a place where you can admire the jewells of the Crown. It is important to watch some videos on the web or read something about the place before going there, it’ll enhance your experience during your visit. Do not miss the oportunity to see this place.",History everywhere
"July 11, 2018","We didn't really plan ahead too much when visiting the tower, so ended up doing so on an unusually hot summer day. We didn't get there at the right time to join a tour, so we wandered around the tower at our own pace, occasionally listening in to any passing tour groups to pick up little tid-bits of information.This is a truly amazing landmark/museum. So much history packed into such a small place. The only disappointment was how long it takes to get through to the crown jewels. Be prepared to wait for quite a long time outside before you can make your way into the exhibition space. For us on this day, that meant a long wait in the sun.Once inside you get to explore the collection at your own pace, with no set time for you to move through, really allowing you to make the experience as thorough or as brief as you want it to be.This was one of those things that was great to do as an iconic tourist attraction, but I'm not sure I would find value in going through again. Though I do recommend it to those who have the time.",Do the Beefeater tour
"July 10, 2018","We happened upon the tower without a plan and purchased entry. It was a great experience. You must do the included  Beefeater tour (it meets at the entrance every half hour I believe)!  We had Dave and he was AMAZING!! I have a feeling they are all really good. So much history I could have spent much longer inside but we ran right up against closing time so be sure you give yourself plenty of time to explore after the tour. We went at 3 and that day it closed at 5:30 and we did the beefeater tour (1 hour), Crown Jewels, very fast white tower and very very fast through the torture tower before we ran out of time. ",so much history
"July 9, 2018",Much history in the Tower of London. If you are a fan of English history stopping by the tower is a must. ,Wonderful historic place with a gruesome past!
"July 7, 2018","An iconic piece of English history well worth the visit. Whilst the crown jewels are staggering there is so much more to the Tower of London. The history, the stories, the armoury and the old chapel is beautiful. We found going early to be there when it opened was well worth it to see the opening and miss the crowds.",Highlight of our trip
"July 5, 2018",Took the Yeoman Warder tour and it was a memorable experience.  Everyone enjoyed the attraction including my 11 year old.  ,Beautiful and very interesting
"July 3, 2018","Had 1 day in London, asked cabbie where to go, he said Tower of London, he was right. Pomp and ceremony, beef eaters and stories, Crown Jewels. History galore, meusem and lunch on site. A visit to remember. Thanks cabbie",Good history lesson

"June 30, 2018","The Tower of London has a lot of great history but was very crowded and not easy to get to by the Tube. We joined the Beefeater tour, which is about 60 minutes.

"June 21, 2018","This was our 8th visit to London however our 1st to the Tower of London. First of all we were surprised at the size of the place. In every corner there was something to see, hear and learn. The condition of the castle was excellent, having been undergoing continual renovation for years. We thought 2 hours would have us ready to leave so we made arrangements to meet others however we could easily have spent 2 more hours there. We highly recommend it.",So Much History
"June 20, 2018","We visited the Tower of London primarily to see the Crown Jewels.  We visited the Jewels and then joined a tour with one of the Beefeaters.  The history shared during the initial explanation of the property itself is unbelievable, but once you begin visiting the exhibits you actually realize how our ancestors were forced to defend their property and their Country.  This is a definite must see.",Excellent 
"June 20, 2018",We visited recently and joined the Beefeater tour. Spike was very informative and humorous. Amazing to see Anne Boleyn’s resting place in the beautiful chapel.,Tower of london
"June 20, 2018",What an awesome place full of history.. take the yeoman tour.  It was brilliant the yeoman we had was a hoot and by God did he know his stuff. ,Excellent!
"June 19, 2018",The tower grounds are amazing...so much to see. We didn’t get the “London pass” so I had to get the tickets there. It was not a problem. Waited maybe 10 minutes then went straight through the gate. They offer tours every 1/2 hour I believe but it only takes you around the outside. We opted to wander and it was lovely. Spent maybe 2-2.5 hours touring.  ,Beautiful day for tour
"June 15, 2018",Took a tour today with a private guide. Great way to do it so you get great explanations of what we saw and the history behind it. Bathrooms were clean. ,Interesting and entertaining Yeoman tour
"June 14, 2018","We went in the late afternoon, about 2:45 or 3 pm, and at that time there was no queue, and we felt we had plenty of time to see everything. I think it might be a little cheaper to buy online. The history and grounds were amazing but the best part was Billy Beefeater’s tour (included in the ticket price). ",Stunning Crown Jewels
"June 12, 2018","There's so much history in it. We had a guided tour but I wish I got the audio tour as well. The Crown Jewels was absolutely beautiful. It's definitely worth spending a whole day there. One complaint wass too crowded. We're there in May, around the same time as the wedding of Harry and Megan. Needless to say, million other people were there too to watch the wedding, plus sightseeing. And that translated into over crowding everywhere.",3 to 4 hours easily can be spent here
"June 11, 2018","We went through pretty quickly as we had lots on our agenda. The history, armour crown jewels were amazing. Wish we had time to see all the other towers in here. Kids loved it. We did end up seeing the 62nd celebration of the Queen's coronation because of the day we visited here!",Great historical site with plenty of British history
"June 10, 2018","The Tower of London consists of a number of individual buildings each with its own story to tell. The Beefeater tour guides are terrific and tell very colorful stories of the Tower and those who were here. Allow a good three hours to see the majority of the site and expect to be waiting in long lines (queues) for a while.  The wait for the Crown Jewels looked worse then it was as it moves quickly. If you plan ahead, buy tickets online and print at home to save 15%. There’s a reasonably priced cafe on site and lavatories in multiple locations so the visit can be low stress if you’re not in a rush. ",Disappointed on second visit
"July 14, 2018","We'd been to the Tower back in 2000 and did the small group tour with the Yeoman Warder guide. Did the same thing this time but didn't get the full experience. They took us into the church and told us about the bloody history, but said that due to the heat, they were not doing full tours. I guess people were fainting and there had been 3 heart attacks. Understandable, but would have been nice if they told us this upon entrance, since we paid for the special tour. Bummer for our teen who'd never been.",Crown jewels and lots to explore!
"July 14, 2018","The Tower of London is an amazing fortress with lots to explore!  Most people make a b-line for the crown jewels, and that was definitely the way to go.  We arrived at the tower shortly after it opened, and the line to view the jewels were already over 30 minutes long!  So we joined the crowds and got in the line.  We waited outside for about 20 minutes, and then another 15 or so inside the building, where there were at least interesting things to see.  The crown jewels are viewed via moving sidewalks, which is great because it keeps people from standing at the jewel cases for extended periods of time.  Be sure to go on both sides of the jewels, and go through as many times as you would like. We also explored the White Tower, which I think is the most tower at the Tower of London.  It has a lot of suits of amour, and an amazing metal dragon.  It's 200 steps up, and a long walk down a spiral staircase, but it is worth the trip.  You could easily spend a full day exploring the Tower of London.  there are several small towers to explore, and a walk along the fortress walls is a must.",Excellent must see
"July 14, 2018",Highlight of the Tower of London is the Crown Jewels Even more amazing in person.  You can’t take pictures inside the Crown Jewels area but captured a lot of other memories in history through out the rest of the tour.Highly recommend this as a must see in any trip to London.There is a line usually to see the jewels but it moves quick quickly. Worth the trip.,"Get there early, do the beefeater tour!"
"July 14, 2018","The beefeater tour does not start before 10 even though it opens at 9, so my best suggestion would be to do the crown jewels first, then the beefeater tour. It's included in your ticket. Our yeoman, Spike I believe his name was, was absolutely fantastic, delivering the history of the tower with dedication and lots of humour. They must have vocal training to be able to speak over the planes frequently flying in the airspace above London. The other parts of the tower are well suited for adults and children alike, but there are quite a few steps in the white tower. Unsure about accessibility options there. Booking online is cheaper than buying on site, and you don't have to do it at any time in advance.",A MUST visit when in London!
"July 13, 2018",This is where all the action was way back in the day. There is so much history here. The Beefeaters give a great tour. We spent two hours here and wished we had a little more time.,Get there early!
"July 13, 2018","By getting in line about a half hour before they opened, we were able to get to the Crown Jewels right away, which is EXTREMELY worth it, as within 20 minutes there is a line that wraps around and takes over an hour. Buying tickets online saves a few pounds.Also, big recommendation that you go to whatever theatrical performance they are producing at the time. We saw a show about the last days of Anne Boleyn's life and it was PHENOMENAL. 35 minute, free show outdoors with music and wonderful performers.",Huge Place ! 
"July 13, 2018",Make sure wear a comfortable walkin shoes as its kinda huge place. Many tower inside that have different history like bloody tower etc. In the crown jewels tower you can’t take photos and often have long queue takes less 20mins to wait. Along the area have some guards which you can take photo together :) I dont see shops inside that you can buy some water or snacks. Only one icecream kiosk with two handsome crew 😂. So make sure before you go in you have energy already or eat first. Inside some area to seat as well as toilet. So far worth to visit and outside have the nice view of the London Bridge. ,Almost one thousand years of history in the heart of London
"July 11, 2018","It is a magic place full of intriguing stories of torture and death of important and not so important characters in England History. It is also a place where you can admire the jewells of the Crown. It is important to watch some videos on the web or read something about the place before going there, it’ll enhance your experience during your visit. Do not miss the oportunity to see this place.",History everywhere
"July 11, 2018","We didn't really plan ahead too much when visiting the tower, so ended up doing so on an unusually hot summer day. We didn't get there at the right time to join a tour, so we wandered around the tower at our own pace, occasionally listening in to any passing tour groups to pick up little tid-bits of information.This is a truly amazing landmark/museum. So much history packed into such a small place. The only disappointment was how long it takes to get through to the crown jewels. Be prepared to wait for quite a long time outside before you can make your way into the exhibition space. For us on this day, that meant a long wait in the sun.Once inside you get to explore the collection at your own pace, with no set time for you to move through, really allowing you to make the experience as thorough or as brief as you want it to be.This was one of those things that was great to do as an iconic tourist attraction, but I'm not sure I would find value in going through again. Though I do recommend it to those who have the time.",Do the Beefeater tour
"July 10, 2018","We happened upon the tower without a plan and purchased entry. It was a great experience. You must do the included  Beefeater tour (it meets at the entrance every half hour I believe)!  We had Dave and he was AMAZING!! I have a feeling they are all really good. So much history I could have spent much longer inside but we ran right up against closing time so be sure you give yourself plenty of time to explore after the tour. We went at 3 and that day it closed at 5:30 and we did the beefeater tour (1 hour), Crown Jewels, very fast white tower and very very fast through the torture tower before we ran out of time. ",Beefeater Tour!
"April 24, 2018","If you go to the Tower of London, here is my advice. Get your tickets online before you go. If you are traveling and don't have access to a printer then have your tickets held for pick-up. It's super easy and will save you a ton of time waiting in the ticket line.Also, get there right when it opens and head straight for the royal jewels. We arrived 10 minutes after the Tower opened and walked straight into the jewel room without a minute of wait time.Finally, make sure you take the free (with admission) Beefeater tour. Not only is it educational, but very entertaining. We've done this twice now and both times it has been a highlight of seeing the Tower.",Want to go again!
"April 18, 2018","We enjoyed the Tower of London as part of a day tour of London. We got to meet & greet a Beefeater Guard, see the Crown Jewels and wander around the site. Would love to return and see even more!! ","A must do ""Londony"" activity"
"April 15, 2018","You travel to London, you want to do the classic London things- you've got to do the Tower of London! The history of London seems to to start here, incredibly old history and the oldest buildings that you can follow the footsteps of almost a 1000 years of history through! Of course the crown jewels are cool but what I enjoyed the most is hearing the stories and taking my mind back in time with them.",Don't miss this!!
"April 14, 2018",This is a must see experience for all ages.   And men and eomen...  boys and girls.... from cannons to jewels.,Great slice of history
"April 11, 2018",No trip to London would be complete without a trip to the Tower of London. There is lots to see and do here. If you love history you will love this. So interetsting. This was my second visit and still learnt new things. ,Choose the right time to visit
"April 11, 2018",Do not visit if it's likely to rain.-- Guided tours (best part) are cancelled if it rains heavily.Do not visit at the weekend.-- Too busy to be enjoyable.Do not visit on a public holiday (or few days either side of a public holiday).-- So busy it feels like a theme park for tourists and not a historic place.If using a voucher - always check small print before planning a trip.-- 2 for 1 offers are not valid for extending periods of time and during the summer.Visiting during quieter times when the weather's good is important at this site. Wait for good conditions.,"The Jewels,"
"April 9, 2018","An interesting piece of history and a must see for history buffs, coming from the US and hearing about 10th century history at a place occupied since then, pretty interesting. The Jewels were interesting too, grand and imposing in their purple velvet! The commentary on the Beefeater tour was the highlight very much informative and inclusive, anyone visiting must take the tour. The restaurant inside the establishment was pretty good too, with a good choice of self serve foods at reasonable rates. Only negative was the want of enogh Washrooms and the locations for them.",Amazing 
"April 7, 2018","I actually had my doubts about this one, but we stayed there for hours and it was fascinating. I recommend starting with the free 30- to 45-minute tour led by a Beefeater - it’s a great orientation with an overview of the layout and history. It seems like they run continuously through the day and they start near the entrance. ",best free tour
"April 6, 2018",there is a free tour offered once inside the tower which is led by a “beefeater”. our guide was Laurence and he was very funny and knowledgeable. the best tour of our trip to london!,A no miss in London
"April 3, 2018","This is a no miss place in London, SO BRITISH and SO FULL of HISTORY, is a place you and your family will enjoy .  The most important?  the Crown Jewels...    A good tip of an amazing experience, take the Public Transportation Boat, from Westminister piers to the Tower Pier, it will cost you 6.5 Pounds only, you will enjoy the river, and then land in the Tower for a great visit...   Just fantastic.  For families, buy the special Family Ticket, is the most convenient option.",Fascinating
"January 18, 2018","The only reason that this review is getting 4 stars instead of 5, is the fact that everything started closing around 3:30, before the wife and I had a chance to see everything. The amount of history at the castle was incredible... They have a nice Jewelry exhibit, museum of British military regiments and show the old living quarters of those who once called it home. There is a small reserve of UK soldiers patrolling the grounds. You will see them standing posts and marching about. Dont get too close. You can also wait and go along with a tour guide (in costume) to walk you across the entire premises, giving you historical knowledge along the way. The wife and I opted not to go this route, because it would have taken too long... Other than that, if you visit in January, be prepared for the cold. Would definitely visit again. ",favorite landmark London
"January 16, 2018",Get there early because it gets packed.  Make sure you join a tour given by a beefeater.  The Crown Jewels are beautiful!,Fantastic!
"January 15, 2018",Amazing history in a wonderful setting. Must do the guided tour with yeoman Warder! Set aside at least 2-3 hours to see it properly.,January 2018 visit
"January 13, 2018","Yes, it was quite chilly this week when we visited, but - hey - it’s London in January! Always love this stop in London. What was great this time was the chapel tour with Spike. He was great!",Tower of jewels and batels
"January 13, 2018","Visited with hole family. Their first time, kids with 7.LOVED every detail! From the historicalAspect to the gran jewels safe showing!Amazing!",Interesting Experience!
"January 11, 2018",This is a really interesting location to see. I especially enjoyed viewing the Crown Jewels! Ordered tickets online ahead of our visit. ,Lots to see and do
"January 5, 2018",This attraction was well worth the time. You can take a tour or go on your own. It is easy to spend a few hours here. The Ravens are amazing. Check out the jewels. Easy to get around and lots to see and do.,Take your time!
"January 5, 2018","Really enjoyed our visit here despite a blistering cold wind. The Yeoman Warder ""tour"" is a great novelty, but isn't actually much of a tour. In hindsight, we would have gotten the audio guide for a self-guided tour and allowed much more time to visit all the outbuildings. We were a bit rushed and there's so much to see! Café onsite was a bit frenetic but had lots of good options. ",Wish I had more time
"January 4, 2018",Loved Tower of London.  So much history and stories.  Definitely something to do again.  All of the employees are so delightful and friendly.  The audio guided tour is excellent  LOTS of walking!  ,Lots of History
"January 4, 2018",This place has so much history!  This place blew my mind thinking of all the Queens that were beheaded in the courtyard.  Try to spend atleast two hours here so you can see the whole thing.,Love the history 
"December 16, 2017","25 years since my last visit but was girlfriends first .Time I got another large helping of English history something we really excel at.Well worth making use of the 2for1 offer by taking the train in to London if your visiting from out of town like us.‘Spike’ our Yeoman guard tour guide was great, funny and informative. These ‘beefeater ‘ tours are an absolute must for any visitor , plus  the outstanding jewel house what’s not to love",Highlight of the trip
"December 5, 2017", I found the Tower of London to be very interesting and a step back in time. Definitely worth a visit. Make sure to check out the black  ravens.,A 'must see' attraction
"November 26, 2017","Arrived just after it opened for the day, we chose the audio-guided tour (you pay extra for it and can be booked in advance) lots of information and really informative, with extra bits about different areas which you can choose to listen too or not as you wish.  The Yeoman Warder ‘Beefeater’ also do tours if you'd prefer, there a stand giving the time of the next tour.If you love history, then you must visit the Tower of London it just ooozes history from almost every stone.  It was very enjoyable wandering through the building and grounds listening to all the stories. The Crown Jewels were beautiful, and looked like they would be heavy to wear.  After, before leaving we had a cream tea in the café with a cup of tea to warm us up - very yummy and proper Cornish clotted cream.Definitely recommend this as a place to visit.",Crown Jewels are a substantial and extensive historical exhibit.
"November 20, 2017","Although admission is a little pricey, the Crown Jewels are a crowd-pleaser. The grounds inside the castle walls are a pleasant respite from the noise of the city of London. The Crown Jewels are worth a look, there are dozens of precious Crowns and Royal items on display. They make it worth a visit.",Well worth it
"November 12, 2017","Such a classic experience.  We bought our tickets online and therefore skipped to the front of the line.  The audio tour was really informative and kept our young daughter engaged.  The Crown Jewels are amazing, but dont miss the ""reanactment"" of the attacks against the Tower.  Lots of fun. ",Beefeater 402 is a top fella 
"November 12, 2017",My wife has been telling me for 2 years that we need to go to the Tower of London  now I'm a scouser but sorry folks my loyalties lie up north.....way up north. So to go to the home of the Hammer of Scots...Proud Edward boooooo was not right but go we did and we where shown around by Beefeater 402 Spike Abbott...2 words HILARIOUSLY EDUCATIONAL. In this day and age its unpolite to insult other nations BUT Yeoman Abbott your hammer hit the nail on the head when you spoke about words our American friends won't understand....HISTORY from the start he had us all eating out of his hand a spot on tour. Pity the chapel on the tower green wasnt open for our tour but the rest of the Tower and its buildings where open and where amazing....even longshanks' bed chamber.Well worth a visit go on a guided tour first though!!!!,A Must See
"November 8, 2017","Definitely worth a visit especially on your first trip to London. I would give anywhere from 2-4 hours depending how quickly you navigate all the rooms, gift shops, etc... The Crown Jewels are a must, we waited about 30 minutes in line and by the time we were finished the line was double the size.  We started off with the free Yeoman guide which can be entertaining, but the group was so large we ended up doing the self guided audio tour which may actually give more information and lets you spend more time in all the rooms as you tour the Tower.",Take the Guided Tour
"November 7, 2017","We bought  tickets as part of the Original Bus Tour package, and joined a tour by one of the warders at the entrance.  These guys are ex-military, with service at the Tower as an honor.    They entertain with great stories about the history of the Tower.  The Tower itself has various exhibits of weaponry, armor, and the Tower during WW1 and WW2.",Spend a few hours and take a tour.
"November 6, 2017",This was my second time to the Tower of London and I enjoyed both times.  It is so interesting so take your time to take it all in.  It is good to get as much information as possible so take a guided tour.,Very interesting couple of hours spent in London
"November 1, 2017","The Tower of London is something you should not miss out on doing.   We joined a tour with one of the Yeomen of the Guard, that was the best thing we did.   Spike was his name and he was so very interesting and entertaining.  He was a great story teller and his tour went for an hour.  We learnt so much about the Tower and it's history.   After the tour we went and looked at the Crown Jewels   We also saw the Ravens in the gardens.   We loved this place so much.   You must take the time to visit it.",Educational and Fun
"October 31, 2017",I thought this place was so interesting! Lots to see and beautiful view of the Bridge. They even do reenactments which were rather entertaining. ,sister in laws
"October 30, 2017","This was so interesting to see the head of Crown Jewels and learn the history. The Ravens stole everyone just looking and having photos with them, so funny. Watched the guards for a lengthy time very interesting",Cheers to Beefeater402 Spike Abbott
"October 27, 2017",My wife and I spent the day at the Tower of London.  We were greeted by Yeoman Warder Spike Abbott for a guided tour of the Tower.  Spike was so detailed and fun!  We could not have had a better day!  Thank you @spike_abbottMark and Ginger LeVang,Really Enjoyed This Historic Gem
"October 26, 2017",Recommend you see the Tower of London Crown Jewels and Castle Grounds were great.The Armory was very interestingDefinitely take the tour with the Beefeater -- Loads of fun for everyone,A London must - the Yeomen Guards make the day!
"October 26, 2017","I've been here twice and both times it has been fantastic! The Yeomen Guards do a tour that honestly makes the day and I would recommend doing. They are fabulous to listen to and bring the history of the Tower to life - I think the name of the guard doing our tour was Laurence (I'm not sure though) and I cannot remember the other guards name from our first tour but both were so interesting. There is so much to see there and the crown jewels are a must see! I've been with my boyfriend as a young couple, as well as with family - including a young teenager - so it really is a day out for everyone.We've been to nearly all the London attractions but this is by far one of the best.",Just Go
"October 24, 2017","The tower is amazing. You should go and don't miss this opportunity to see things you will have never imagine seeing in your life. How long there? like 4 hours no rush. Bring a jacket, some rooms are cold and some places of the tower are breeze. Just Go!",My favorite place in London
"October 22, 2017","I don't care how many times I go to The Tower, it never disappoints. I just love running around it. It's essentially a castle in the middle of London. While the crown jewels are impressive, it's the tower itself that holds all the appeal for me. Go!","Expensive, overcrowded, bland"
"October 21, 2017",The Tower of London is pretty much always heaving with so many people and you must queue for a very long time to get into the individual exhibition parts within the structure itself. I really loathed it and regretted paying £40 for two people to enter.,Unbelievable history at your fingertips!
"October 12, 2017","I was unable to visit the first time I was in London 20 years ago so this visit it was my top must-do. My husband and I arrived on a Saturday about 9:15am for a 9am open. The ticket and security lines were extremely short and we headed to the crown jewels first as had been suggested. There was no crowd there and we spent plenty of time being overwhelmed with them. We doubled back to take the 10am Yeoman Warder tour and had Spike as our guide. Spike was enthusiastic, patriotic and funny, he was the ultimate guide around the grounds---do not miss these included Beefeater tours when you plan your visit (It wouldn't be the same without it). After the tour we spent a ton of time wandering through the dungeon, Bloody Tower and several hours spent in the White Tower where we were blown away at the history and artifacts inside. I had no idea the White Tower contained so much. The ToL and the Yeoman Warder tours are a do-not-miss when in London.",Allow Time to Explore!!!
"October 8, 2017",There is so much to see and do at the Tower that you can spend the better part of a day exploring all the sights.  Be sure and take the Beefeater's guided tour.  It is well worth it!  There is a nice café for lunch or tea.,Go here to see the change of guards instead of Buckingham Palace!
"July 26, 2017","We went here in the late afternoon, and although we did not have much time to walk around before closing time, we managed to see the changing of the guards. Unlike Buckingham Palace, you can get much closer to the guards here -- so close that as the guards being relieved of duty walked away, the told one tourist to ""Move away from the Queen's Guards!"" while giving the lady a bit of a gentle shove -- which my sons thought was so cool. Also nice to see the crown jewels, the tower of terror, and the armory building. ",The Beefeater makes the trip!
"July 25, 2017","Great tour at the Tower of London led by a true Beefeater. Even on a hot July day, he was able to find shade to make the tour enjoyable. We learned a lot of history and enjoyed our tour around the grounds.",Fascinating historical must see.
"July 24, 2017",Recommend buying tickets online and arriving early.  We arrived at opening and had no wait for the Crown Jewels.  Yeoman tour fun interesting and highly recommend.  You line up at a meeting point just inside the entrance. We had a large group however had no trouble hearing or following along as they are expert tour guides allow at least 3 - 4 hours to get the most out of the visit.,Family day out
"July 23, 2017","Get your tickets online before your visit, it's cheaper and easier. With children you find easy way to do everything. You can bring your buggy and park it inside. Great place to know about Monarchy History of GB. Your tickets are valid for all day long.",A must see
"July 21, 2017",Go early in the morning.  We were there by 9:00--opens at 9:30.  We had a London Pass and just had to get in line at the gate.  You don't have to go to the ticket booths to 'exchange' your pass for a ticket.  Go to the Crown Jewels first then tour the grounds and other buildings.  We did the Crown Jewels then walked back down to the entrance and joined the next Beefeater's Tour.  They are funny and very interesting.  The tours start at the entrance and finish in the chapel--1 hour.  The audio guides are decent but rather dry.  Following along where the listening sites are is not always clear.  ,truly enjoyed the breadth of opportunities to go back into the experience
"July 17, 2017","Lovely exhibits and great support staff.  Enjoyed ourselves very much, especially looking at the artillery and reading stories",History within arms reach
"July 17, 2017","Just waiting at the ticket box you can't help but be in awe of the imposing structures known as The Tower of London. Once inside you can feel and touch centuries of history oozing from every brick and stone. This isn't a purpose built attraction, it was once the real life residence of Kings and Queens. A free tour with a Yeoman Warden as your guide is a must. Explore the White Castle and see the armour once worn by nobles and probably some who were ignoble. The queue to see the crown jewels was very long and as it was an unseasonably hot day we decided to give them a miss much to our disappointment. Allow plenty of time when visiting. Great day out. ",Billy Beefeater was just magnificent
"July 16, 2017","Wow. Just wow. Our guide, Billy Beefeater, was funny, entertaining and knowledgeable. You can visit London and the Tower of London without the tour. But, why would you. The tour was wonderful. THANK YOU !!!",Family Vacation 
"July 10, 2017",We enjoyed the white tower and the Crown Jewels. It gave you a good explanation of the British Monarchy.  You can spend a few hours. We had the London Pass so we went went in quickly. ,Excellent - don't miss the Yeoman Warders tour
"July 8, 2017","To be honest, I was there to see the Koh-i-noor diamond, but what we got was a grand tour by one of the Yeoman Warders. We were told ""just do the Yeoman tour and the Jewels"" - you've see it all! They were right .. spent three wonderful hours there! Definitely on my ""to recommend"" list!",An average experience.
"August 30, 2020","The Tower is certainly feeling the effects of Covid. You have to book online. No telephones are manned so no one to answer any questions. I, at first, had a problem downloading my tickets but there was no telephone line to report a problem. I eventually did download them. It was a good job I managed to do it because the email I sent about the issue was not answered until after the date of my visit. A number of the attractions are not open and there are no Beefeater tours, which is a shame because everyone likes them. I just wonder if, with a bit of organisation and determination, the tours could happen. Social distancing and limited numbers could easily be part of the arrangements. There aren't too many people visiting at the moment which is a good thing. We queued for about 35 minutes to see the Crown Jewels. I imagine it is much longer in normal times. The Tower is a wonderful group of buildings but, I feel there is something lacking.  The Beefeater tours need to be reestablished, The torture museum - always appealing to young boys - was a real disappointment. We don't expect it to be like the London Dungeon, but it definitely needs to be a little more graphic and with more detail. I first went about 40 years ago with my children, This time it was with my grandson. He wasn't hugely impressed so I think this will be my last visit.",enjoyable but poor access
"August 30, 2020",It was very enjoyable but very badly set up for wheelchair users . ( lift closed off because of covid ) and some areas not accessible at all .,Fantastic
"August 30, 2020",Definitely worth buying ticket on line to skip the queues. If you are visiting London I would thoroughly recommend a visit to the Tower of London. Founded. In 1066 this UNESCO world heritage site sits in the banks of the river Thames. The history surrounding it and played out within its walls cannot fail to interest adults and children alike. The Crown Jewels are also housed there - book ahead as there is always a queue. Great shop and lots of cafes in the area. It is a fantastic day out.,Go now whilst it’s quiet!
"August 30, 2020","Perfect time to visit as it’s so quiet at the moment! Felt very safe as plenty of space to distance from others. Was disappointed the Yeoman Warder tour wasn’t on but understandable given Covid and they were at least dotted around the grounds ready and very willing to answer all our questions ‘Spike’ was particularly informative and a great story teller! Such an interesting historical sight, delightful staff, stunning jewels and hilarious ravens! Would strongly recommend for all ages. Only negative would be the website should advise what is running due to Covid aftermath to avoid disappointment.",Not the same after lockdown
"August 29, 2020","Visited the first day they opened after lockdown, but sadly a few places within the site were still closed due to covid which was a shame. However, I would recommend the Tower if it's your first time visiting. It was my second time and not as worthwhile. The place felt a bit hollow. Hopefully things will pick up again long after covid. ",Lovely quiet day in a normally busy spot
"August 29, 2020",Had a lovely day here. Extremely quiet considering we were at one of the biggest tourist attractions in London and it was lovely to experience. Would highly recommend it!,Fantastic afternoon
"August 29, 2020",A great afternoon. We entered around 1.30 & didn’t have to queue. There is plenty to look around including the White Tower & Crown Jewels. I had read online that there was a one way system but this wasn’t clear. There was a large queue for the jewels however this moved fairly quickly. Viewing the jewels you are stood on a conveyer belt so get just a brief look but it is well worth it. There are still some areas closed for example the cafe and the chapel but I still had a great day. Staff are all friendly & helpful. I particularly recommend visiting to anyone with an interest in history or photography as there are great opportunities for atmospheric photos. Loved it. Thank you.,Birthday treat
"August 29, 2020",Loved the Tower of London it’s history and of course the Raverns. Great Covid 19 precautions put in place and never queued.,An absolute gem of a place.....
"August 28, 2020","Visited today, with a 10am pre-booked ticket. It was eerily quiet, but we obviously took advantage of the shorter queues and limited numbers.We've walked past the Tower of London numerous times, on numerous previous visits, but the crowds always put me off, so today was perfect.I absolutely loved the visit. Fascinating, quirky, and the Yeoman Warders were fabulous. The Crown Jewels were utterly stunning, and almost worth the admission fee alone. Loved reading about our amazing history, and interesting past. My teenage boys were interested too, and enjoyed the suits of armour in the White Tower. Well wirth a visit, especially with reduced numbers. We left at 1 and most places had queues to get in.",Great visit without the ques.
"August 28, 2020","It was great to see the Crown Jewels and not have to que for ages. We had a 10:00 timed entry ticket which meant the que to get in was only 5 minutes. Then when inside you could walk straight into the Crown Jewels and White Tower without any que. Some areas such as the Bloody Tower were empty when we went in, it was really strange. It did seem to have got a lot busier when we left around 12:30, so if you can go early. Wonderful trip which we all really enjoyed. ","Brilliant,Don't miss this one"
"May 14, 2017",I've always wanted to do this tour but never got round to it.We were on an open top bus run and arrived about 2.25pm.we had prepaid so missed the queue at the entrance.The tour is taken by Beefeaters who are very knowledgeable on the history and the talks are interesting with dates names etc and also funny with the mickey being taken out of the people on the tour.Its all ligh hearted stuff.It lasted about an hour and covers th periods from its first uses up to the present day.Groups ate made up of about 30 people.,"If you have time for only one site to see, this is the one"
"May 14, 2017","We got there early and spent about 4 hours at the Tower of London.  I suggest you see the Crown Jewels first before that section gets crowded. Afterwards, I was hesitant at first but my wife suggested we take the Beefeater tour.  It was great!  Engrossing facts and history of the Tower and England with lots of humor. We saw many, many sites and attractions in London and we both agreed that this was our favorite site during our 5 day visit.",Highly recommend to start the day
"May 13, 2017","My mom and I are in London from Canada and used our London Pass today. We started with the Tower of London because we had read that the lines could get long. We took the tube from King's Cross, where we are staying, right to the tower. There was clear signage that made it extremely easy to get to the entrance of the tower. We did not have to wait in a single line and found there were not very many people there when we arrived around 9:30 am this Saturday. We headed straight to see the Crown Jewels as we had also read that this usually has a long line. We were able to enter right away. It was a little frustrating inside as there is supposed to be no photography but a family that was near us kept pushing their way around and taking photos. This was not the fault of anyone else though. It seemed to be getting busier as we were leaving about an hour and a half later. ",This was a must-see destination
"May 12, 2017",We got in early as it opened and went straight to the Crown Jewels. We normally don't last more than 90 to 120 minutes at a destination but spend a full three hours at the Tower. Loved it. Lot's of history and great information. We went on the free tour and loved the insights about the Tower. ,Interesting
"May 11, 2017",A lot of history. Good visuals of items from history. My 13 year old nephew really enjoyed it as I did.,A must see in London
"May 8, 2017","I love English history so the tower was a must see. We did the Beef Eater tour and it was amazing, even if you are not a British history nut you will enjoy this experience.",must see
"May 7, 2017","You have to go to the Tower at least once.  Kids enjoyed it.  Very crowded on the day we went, long lines and couldn't get close enough to the Yeoman to hear the tour - which is usually excellent.  Buy tickets ahead of time or prepare to stand in line. ",Pleasant Go-At-Your-Pace Attraction
"May 6, 2017","My wife and I arrived to the Tower with concerns that it would be excessively crowded. It was not (Thursday afternoon). We used Rick Steve's London book for a self guided tour. The location is gorgeous. While some attractions were more historic or beautiful, this is a must see location for the combination of interesting information, historical significance, and great views. ",Such a fantastic place!
"May 6, 2017","This is a must see attraction in London! I suggest going in the morning as soon as it opens to beat the crowds. I also HIGHLY suggest joining the Yeoman Warder's tours. They operate every hour, are free, and are absolutely fantastic!",Buy tickets online. Go straight to the Crown Jewels.
"May 4, 2017","Go early. Buy a ticket online, print it out, and avoid the long lines in buying a ticket. If you want an audio guide, you can reserve that online as well. Do it to avoid the long lines. Once you enter, go straight to the Crown Jewels because the lines here can get really long.","This is a ""do not miss attraction!"""
"March 26, 2017","This was one of the highlights of our trip. When you get there, go see the Crown Jewels first. Then, take the tour through the White Tower (they only had 3 of these the day we were there).  Then, go back to the front and go on a tour with the Yeoman Warder. They start every 30 minutes throughout the day and it was the only way to get into the chapel. Tons of history!",Awesome Afternoon
"March 23, 2017","I'm just going to contectualise this by saying I love the medieval history of London so I'm probably a little biased, but the whole Tower of London experience was awesome!We went on a beautiful sunny afternoon and managed to sneak in just as one of the Beef Eaters (the guide/guard) named Spike was starting the tour. The guided tour lasted about 30 mins and went into the history both the buildings themselves and the happenings within the buildings during the first half of the second century. Spike was a fantastic speaker and we learnt a lot!After that we spent a good few hours having a look at all the other parts of the tower; the Crown Jewels and history of the monarchy, armory (weapons and armor from the year 1000 to now), the history of the soldiers themselves during the multiple wars fought in and by London (again between 1000-now) and simply taking in the views and reveling in the knowledge that everything around us was pretty much the same as it was 1000 years ago.It's a little pricey as far as tours go but I'd highly recommend putting aside a few hours and seeing it!",Absolutely brilliant!
"March 20, 2017","In the over 20 years I have been living in or visiting London I have never been here. In fact, I avoided it as I thought it would be gruesome or some-such. I arrived early, went straight to the Crown Jewels before the crowds arrived and then took a Yeomen of the Guard tour and just wandered through the whole place. It was endlessly fascinating and I'm so pleased I finally took the plunge. I spent an astonishing six hours within the walls. The ravens are supermodels and the Yeoman tour was fascinating and hilarious. A definite must-see in London!",Classic London Attraction
"March 19, 2017","I attended a tour led by a Yeoman Warder and found it very enjoyable. I wish I could remember his name, but all I can really remember is that he was bald and very entertaining (I know that is basically useless information, sorry). I highly recommend going on a tour with a YW because it greatly enhanced my experience of the Tower of London. I learned so much more than if I had just walked around reading plaques.I didn't have to wait too long to see the crown jewels as I went in  February but I can imagine that the line can be ridiculously long in the summer. I'd recommend going early in the morning to avoid the line.A great attraction for all tourists. It's good for families, history buffs, and those that just love British culture.",Online tickets 
"March 18, 2017","We bought our tickets online having seen the terrific queues to buy tickets and missing out in the past. we queued to get in to then be told our paper tickets (which were printed at home) must be taken to the ticket office & exchanged, before we can enter. This was a source of frustration for us and many other tourists. Luckily we were early but I heard some other poor people being turned away as we left when the queue was very long. Buying tickets in advance becomes pointless when you need to wait to get them anyway. ",A shame that you can't take photos of the Crown Jewels.
"March 16, 2017",A fascinating historical site that has interesting buildings and information throughout. Unfortunately photos are not allowed when observing the Crown Jewels. They would rather you buy books than take photos.,"Crown jewels and lots of history, worth the trip!"
"March 4, 2017","Get here early enough to do a full tour either with audio guide or Beefeater (best), we got there a little too late in the day, about 2:30 so didn't get through the whole audio tour after seeing the crown jewels-- they close at 4:30pm (in February when we went.) Crown jewels were spectacular, and it is amazing to walk some of those historical hallways and see the old carved graffiti in the tower walls! ",Must see while in London
"March 4, 2017",Billy the Beefeater was entertaining.  It rained the day we went so he took us to the Chapel and told us the history and was thouroughly enjoyable.  He cracked a few jokes and answered historical questions.  Every member of the staff was knowledgeable and eager to speak in depth about the history and culture.   ,Take a Beefeater tour
"March 2, 2017",What a thoroughly enjoyable place it is. You can spend a day here and still not take it all in. It is steeped in history having served the Kings & Queens of England since 1066. The crown jewels and all of the Queens regalia are stored here and you have to see them to believe them. My tip would be to do a free Beefeater tour to learn more about the goings on here. Incredibly fascinating.,"Well worth a visit , History is Fun "
"March 1, 2017","Our first time on a social visit to the city , this was recommended, and well worth it at a cost of £25 per adult .On a cold Sat morning in Feb , there for the 10 am tour (that's a must with the Beefeaters) and was a real highlight of our short weekend stay . Beefeater Dave made this tour real 'Fun' and a great history lesson .  Next time taking the kids ""Be early or book your tickets in advance , cause even in Feb the queues are long at 0900hrs on a cold Sat morning .",The Yeoman Warders are great tour guides
"May 2, 2017","This is a must do attraction in London.  Definitely join a tour by a Yeoman Warder, and keep an eye out for the ravens.",Trip down London history
"April 30, 2017","We (me and my son) had a great time at the tower. When we got in we listend to the wards who learnt us a lot about the history of the tower and the other buildings, with great humor. The crown jewels and the castle ravens makes it a great visit. ",Amazing 
"April 29, 2017","Highly recommended the audio tour, then the beefeater tour, both excellent, would suggest get there early, do the crown jewels first!  Or you are going to que alot!  Then do beefeater or audio tour, but do both, and then go a second day to see all the stuff you could not fit in on the first!  Amazing place!  Totally happy with our visit, and not stupidly expensive!  worth every penny ",A wonderful place to visit
"April 28, 2017",If you're going to London a stop at the tower is a must. I think most people know what the Tower of London is so here are some tips for a good visit:-Go midweek when the crowds will be smaller. -Go early and allocate at least half of the day. There is a lot to see.-Go see the Crown Jewels FIRST before the queue gets too big. -After the Crown Jewels go back to the moat at the entrance and take the Beefeater tour that leaves every 30 mins until half 3. The tour lasts about an hour and it will give you some great info about the tour. It's free. While on the tour pick the places you want to go back to see in detail. - Think about bringing a packed lunch to save money as the cafes can be expensive. ,Amazing history!
"April 27, 2017","Spent 3 hours here and totally worth it! Beefeater tour amazing with James woodcock! He was entertaining, informative and made the history easy to understand. So much to see here !",Filled with history
"April 27, 2017","There's lots to see and do. Little boys will love the armours, knights and weapons and little girls the crown jewels! For grown-ups there's lots of interesting facts and even without taking a tour one can get a good overview.",History and fun
"April 23, 2017",My young boys really enjoyed it as they imagined what it would be like to live 400 years ago.  The armor was a higlight and we enjoyed the reenactment of the 4 groups who attempted to breach the walls.,"Gory tales, history and heritage"
"April 17, 2017","Take the tube to Tower Hill and the ticket booths are a short walk away. If you can, take a tour with one of the Beefeaters in their distinctive tunics and hear their absorbing tales of the past. It concludes in the historic chapel, which is the last resting place of three of Henry VIIIs wives who were executed at The Tower, Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard and Lady Jane Grey.The ancient central tower houses armour and weaponry, but the biggest attraction must be the Crown Jewels belonging to the monarch and including the crown, orb and sceptre used in the Coronation ceremony since the 1600s. Expect to have to queue, but the line moves quickly and once you reach the exhibits themselves you can spend as long as you wish viewing them.Expensive, particularly the new café. For economy take a picnic. The admission is still good value and the attraction is well worth a visit. Expect to spend at least 3 hours to see it all.If this review was helpful, please be kind enough to click the button below.",Awesome tour!
"April 14, 2017",The history is amazing.  The Crown Jewels alone are worth the price of admission.  Recommend getting a Historical London Palace pass to save time waiting to buy aticket.  The Beefeater tour is a must!,Fun History
"April 13, 2017","This was an interesting site, full of history and intrigue. It is easy to leisurely stroll through and choose which areas to visit. Plan on about two hours to see it. I followed a Rick Steves tourbook recommendation and it was perfect. Purchased our tickets in advance on the website to avoid the lines, and arrived early. Start at the crown Jewels and then head back to catch a Yeoman Warder tour which is both entertaining and insightful. After that, view the other sites where the crowds aren't as large.",London Tower Day Out
"February 22, 2017","What a amazing day out with my family at such an historic place, I enjoyed showing my family from Australia around and I am so looking forward to going again this year to show my granddaughter some of the history of the Tower.",Very Interesting
"February 19, 2017","We had not pre-booked the Tower of London on our recent trip however there was only a small queue at the ticket office and we decided to go ahead.  We were greeted by a very lovely ticket saleswoman who did not simply usher us through but had a good chat with us.  If you are going to this attraction when the weather is not great be sure to take a coat as you will need to walk outside to get to see all different parts of the castle but otherwise the majority of things to see are inside so a perfect attraction for whatever the weather.The attraction costs £25 per adult but it does not disappoint.  You can join a guided tour but we chose to go around the grounds self guided.  We did not buy the tour book which was an additional £4.99 but as soon as we got in we wished we had, it would have provided us with a little more information about the history.There was a queue to see the crown jewels but this moved very quickly and it was amazing to see them up close. This attraction suits all ages and there are activities going on throughout the day to entertain the children.Only downside I would say is we did not think that the food in the cafe was that great and a little expensive but it is probably what is expected.  Still worth 5/5 as an excellent attraction.  It kept us busy for hours.  ",A must see
"February 15, 2017","The Beefeater ""Spike"" made this Tour a very interesting experience! He was great at supplying some good stories from the past and early history of the Tower of London. Very nice to be updated of (fractions of) of English history! Our teenager enjoyed him as well!We came at 10am and made it to jewels before the big rush later in the day.",Crown Jewels and Beheadings
"February 12, 2017","Tower of London is a fascinating combination of glamour and demise. The crown jewels are overwhelmingly gorgeous, while the tales of where people ate their last meal or lost their heads brought visitors back to a darker age. I first went to the Tower when I was 13, and the 2nd time when I was 20. I really enjoyed it both times!","A ""Can't Miss"" Attraction"
"February 7, 2017","It's not news to anyone visiting the city, that the Tower of London is a ""can't miss"" attraction for all ages.  We took the tour, and even though I have visited there before, found it informative and fun!  The Crown Jewels exhibit had been reworked since my last visit and is extremely well done.  Tip -- arrive early and go straight to the Crown Jewels exhibit.  We waited about 20 minutes rather than an hour or two queue later in the day.",A Must See When Visiting London
"February 7, 2017","My partner and I were in London last week and went to the Tower.  It was his first time to London and my second time to both London and the Tower.  Even after having already visited the Tower previously, I was still just as fascinated and learned new things.  Our Yoman (Beefeater), Clive, was entertaining, knowledgeable, and took his time to make sure he answered any questions from the group.  The Tower has so much history.  We went to the chapel, saw the guard standing watch in front of the Queens house (she still maintains a residence there as well), saw the ravens on the lawn, went to see the Queen's Jewels, which was an amazing collection of artifacts.  A truly fascinating experience that helps to understand the pride behind the British culture.",Two hours may not be enough
"February 5, 2017","The two hours may not be enough to explore all of the grounds but it's enough to make your feet hurt for the walking. Worth it though, definitely catch the guided tours leaving from the entrance every 30 minutes, they take less than an hour and you can stay after the tour to ask questions, should there be any unanswered. ",Great
"February 4, 2017",So worth a visit i traveled with my 6 year old so avoided some of the scarier things but still fantastic a lot of steps in parts but it is to be expected. Fantastic views and heaps of history completely loved it,Superb day out
"January 29, 2017",This is great value for money. The Beefeater guided tour is a must. Our guide Kevin was hilarious! There is so much to see and do make sure you plan a full day to see this site in its entirety. The onsite cafe had good choice and the food was reasonably priced. Make sure you dress warm in winter most of the day will be outside or in non heated areas.,"If you pick one thing to do, this is it!!"
"January 28, 2017",We had a great time at the Tower of London. History buffs will absolutely love it. We could have spent all day here. Our beefeater (Spike) was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. This was our favorite thing we did in London.,A must see spot in London
"October 4, 2016","Royal History, the Crown Jewels, historic armaments, the ravens, and the Beefeaters are the major highlights.",Fantastic Place to Visit on Your Travels
"October 3, 2016","This was on my list of must-see's for London and I loved it. Probably a good idea to go earlier in the day if you're walking a lot, I could feel the cobblestones through my shoes on my already tired feet. Otherwise, lots to see here such as the historical points and of course the Crown Jewels. There were even some reenactments while we were there. ALSO, if you're a Tudor history fan like me and want to see Anne Boleyn's final resting place inside of St Peter's ad Vincula Chapel, you need to be on the Yeoman's tour. Otherwise you have to wait until 4:30.",A Step Back in Time
"October 3, 2016","This was our second visit to the tower and once again enjoyed it thoroughly.  The exhibits range from the Crown Jewels to the Armoury.  But the highlight for me was just knowing that we were walking through the very place, that so much of England's history had taken place in.  We didn't take advantage of the tours offered by the Yeomen Beefeaters this time but they are highly recommended.On a practical note, do arrive early.  We got there at 9:30 and basically walked right through the ticket line but when departing several hours later the lines were lengthy.  Much of your time is spent outdoors walking between towers so the weather can be a factor for your visit.  Also the cobblestones can be difficult to walk on and slippery when wet so wear comfortable shoes.And lastly, if you travel by train from any other part of GB or from Gatwick or Luton airport (but not from Heathrow) you can get 2 for 1 vouchers for this and many other attractions which save you a great deal of money.  The vouchers must be downloaded in advance.  Check the rail website for links.",Amazing history
"October 2, 2016",What an experience to know that you are walking the same walkways that were walked centuries ago. An absolute MUST SEE when in London.,Bucket list 
"October 2, 2016","Wasn't sure what to expect as not fussed on tour groups, the guide assigned to us was very entertaining and knowledgeable and made it easy to handle. An amazing piece of history still standing and a home for the beefeater's and their families. So glad we went there and just soaked up the history. Crown jewels exhibit was brilliant. So easy to book, on line the day before.",Excellent experience
"September 27, 2016","This was an excellent visit! I recommend the tour with a Yeoman guard. Jim was fun to listen to and very thorough in his knowledge. It is well worth the cost of admission, the time, and your attention. ",Amazing tour
"September 25, 2016","If you go make sure you take the Yeoman Warder guided tour. It was amusing, informative, and one of the best tours I have gone on. I would recommend arriving at the end of the day to avoid the crowds. We caught the last tour at 3:30pm and we were able to enjoy the crown jewels following our tour without too many people. It was more than enough time for us, but it was also my second time visiting.  ","Excellent tour, beautiful views "
"September 22, 2016","We visited The Tower of London towards the end of the day on a Tuesday and the crowds were very minimal, no line for tickets and went on a beefeater tour straight away. We were led by Sandy (?) who was wonderfully engaging. Great tour to start your visit to the tower. Seeing the Crown Jewels were a highlight and stunning in person. The tower is well presented and provides amazing views over other London landmarks such as Tower Bridge. A must in London ",interesting and Entertaining
"September 19, 2016","Lots to see and do at the Tower of London.   We took the free tour and our guide (Yeoman Warder) was entertaining / funny and very informative.You can spend several hours here as there are different parts to see including the Crown Jewels, the tower itself and walking around the perimeter of the fortressOnly negative part was the cafe as we ate lunch there but was disappointed with the food",Awesome must see while visiting London!
"September 18, 2016","We recently had the opportunity to visit the Tower of London and enjoy the Beefeater tour of the grounds. Our guide, Yeoman Mark Anderson was fantastic. His extensive knowledge of the local history mixed with a friendly personality and sharp wit made for an awesome experience. The entire facility is amazing, from the armory in the White Tower to the Chapel and of course, the Crown Jewels. The buildings hold tremendous history and tell there own stories of both good and bad periods of Britain's past.  If you visit London, a visit to the Tower is an absolute necessity!",A Must Visit
"September 17, 2016","Not only is the Tower amazing, but the layout, the guides, the maps, the tours... it's so well organized and efficient and detailed.  The audioguides were fantastic, and I spent 4 hours wandering the complex without every losing interest (or getting lost). A tremendous font of history, culture, religion... anyone who is Anglo must visit- so much of our nation's history is tied up in this one area. Tip: get there early right when it opens.  It gets more and more crowded as the day goes, but at 9am it was the best!Second tip: listen to the Beefeaters.  They are amazing men with great storytelling ability.  You will be glad you did!","Amazing, make sure you do the Yeoman Warder Tour"
"September 13, 2016","An amazing place to wander around. The Crown Jewels are just spectacular, although be prepared for a very long wait. The queue was long but well worth the wait. The shops have the usual souvenirs as well as some beautiful although over my budget items. The ravens are great and well worth a visit. I cannot recommend highly enough a Yeoman Warder Tour. If you are lucky enough to get Billy the Beefeater you will be in for a treat. He is funny, informative and highly entertaining and I could quite happily listen to him for hours, make sure you bring your best smile as he takes photo's of you to put up on twitter! ",Played a major  role  in English  History
"September 12, 2016","Even if  you  are  not  a follower  of  English history, walking  past  the Traitors  Gate as you  enter  the  Tower  of  London  is bound  to  have  some  affect on you. Reflect  on the number  of  people  who  entered  through  the  gate  and died  there. The  huge ravens  strutting  around  the  grounds, the presence  of  Beefeaters  and Queen's  guards helps set the  tone. The  Tower  was originally  a  castle, which  became  a  jail. It was built  in  the  9th  century  but  has been  well  preserved.Be sure  to  take  a tour  with  one of  the  Beefeaters. Their knowledge  of  history  makes  the  Tower  come  alive  and  embellishes what  you  already  know. While  the  price  of  entry  is a bit steep $34.USD, there  is  no  extra  charge  for  the  tour. Make  sure  to  visit  Beauchamp  Tower  where  many  were  held  before  they  were  executed. Anne  Boleyn  stayed  here. There  is  graffiti  on the  walls  left  by prisoners. They  have  created  a  circular  ring listing  those  who  lost  their  head  outside  Beauchamp  Tower. It used  to be just a stone  spot  marked by a sign  The  chapel  can  be  visited  only  on a  Beefeaters  tour. I was told  to  join  in with  a  tour  if I  wanted  to  go  inside. I wanted  to  spend  extra  time  looking  at  the  Crown  Jewels  so I  stepped  off the  conveyor  walkway  used to  shuttle  people  past  the  jewels  and took a  second  ride  on the  other  side.There  is  an entire  building  filled  with  armor, weapons  and stories  about  those  who  lived  in  the  Tower rooms. You  can  spend  a long  time  in this  building  alone. I think  you  have  to plan  on at least  2-3 hours  at the   Tower  of  London. I believe  that  admission  might  be  part  of  the  London  Pass. Since  I was  here on a bus  tour, I didn't  research  that. This  is  my  second  trip  here and  felt  like  I  learned  more  on this  trip. It is  a  very  important  piece  of  English  history.","History, Beauty and Ravens"
"September 12, 2016","This is a beautiful introduction for foreign visitors to the rich history of Britain and the monarchy. Situated along the Thames a stone's throw from Tower Bridge, the Tower of London is a series of towers, many of which are connected through a perimeter wall. Do plan to spend at least a couple of hours to ensure you have the chance to visit several of the structures.  Tours are offered by yeoman warders regularly throughout the day and should not be missed. The Crown Jewels were worth seeing, but I loved that many of the structures were open to the public. One can walk virtually the entire perimeter along the wall encompassing the compound. There is a raven master and several ravens maintained on the grounds, often visible to the public. If you plan far enough in advance (a very long time in advance) you may be able to obtain tickets to the key ceremony, which is held at the end of the day when the tower grounds are locked and night guard is posted. Several yeoman warders (aka Beefeaters) have Twitter accounts where they share gorgeous pictures of the grounds. One of my favorite places in London! A word of caution, be prepared for significant crowds during local school holidays!",Must for History Buffs in London
"September 12, 2016","This is a must stop for anyone interested in medieval london. The White Tower in the middle is almost 1000 years old. The Crown Jewels are here and the exhibit that houses them has recently been redesigned to be much more interesting. Its full though like everyday, so do yourself a favor an order at ticket online so you don't have to wait so long in the lines. And skip the beef eater tours which actually run to like 100 people and just do the audio tour. Totally worth it. ",Bursting with History
"September 9, 2016","This is probably the oldest building in the world that I've been in. It's hard to picture all the history that took place at the Tower of London. The Crown Jewels, the Ravens, the Beefeaters are a sight to see.",My Favorite Attraction in London!!1
"September 9, 2016",Make sure you take to tour with the Beefeater Guard. It is very informative telling about the horrible things that happened here hundreds of years ago yet the guards/guides are so funny and entertaining as well. The crown jewels are there at the Tower. If you are interested in seeing the jewels with no crowds try to get there early and head to see them before taking a tour. Also go hungry because they have an amazing and delicious cafe for baked items as well as lunch. Highly recommend eating there.,Take a trip to the past
"September 8, 2016","Honestly, I know it's one of London's biggest attractions.. But for good reason, it's fantastic!Read up on some history, and the Tower of London is a who's who of London's heritage.A few tips- do get a tour from the beefeaters, makes it very entertaining, and they'll point out things you'd normally miss- try and catch the last tours to avoid heavy clouds.. The last beefeater yoman tour is at 3:30.. We went on the 3:15 tour and it was perfect.. After the tour was done, the crowds had thinned and you kind of felt you had most of the castle to yourself, and had time to see the other attractions.- bring a lite snack, find a park bench and make yourself a little picnic.. We did, and it was the perfect way to take a rest, enjoy the sights, and the beautiful grounds before catching some of the big highlights- do check out the crown jewels, and tour the inside of the white tower.. Both are worthwhile.Happy touring!    ",A must see in London
"September 6, 2016","Fascinating place. It was nice that they sold student tickets as a lot of the attractions don't do that. Well worth the money. There are tours by the beefeaters every half an hour. They deliver an interesting and informative tour of the tower and our tour was delivered by a Yeoman Warder called Spike I think. He was excellent and kept the tour light and funny. Your ticket includes a free tour by the beefeaters, entrance in to see the crown jewels and to other areas such as the white tower and the tower walls. It is a very interesting place, not too expensive for the tickets and a must see in London. One of the best tours in the city",Must for all visitors
"September 4, 2016","Join the hour tour, it was an excellent overview of the Tower history.  Guide made the tour interesting for all ages,  Jewels shouldn't be missed.

"September 2, 2016",Wasn't expecting a lot but it was included in the price of admission. He made the price absolutely worth it. He's very funny. I'm sure they (the Yeomen) all are. Don't miss out on the tour. Make sure you visit the cafe upstairs - quiet and nice sandwiches. And walk along the walls - great views. ,British History is amazing....
"August 29, 2016",Visit this part of British history is an awful experience. Theres nothing like see it with your own eyes. 👍🏻,Steeped in history.
"August 28, 2016",We were lucky to miss all queues and were able to take our time around the whole place. Full of history and a lot to take in. Look out for the graffiti! Very eerie! ,"Fantastic Experience, Pleasant Surprise"
"August 25, 2016","My friend had told us to go here and we ended up spending 5 hours.  We took our hop-on-hop-off bus to the location and just bought tickets there. Definitely pay for the audio guide and if you have kids get the kids tour for them.  Was a lovely day and the area is so large you don't feel any crowds. The only line, which took a 1/2 hour, was to see the crown jewels.  If you love history and all that comes with it definitely spend a day here.",Rare gem
"August 25, 2016",We bought tickets for Tower of London as part of our Big Bus tour - was well worth it! Got an insight into historical London and got to see the Crown Jewels - it's well worth the wait (massive lines).Would recommend this attraction to family and friends.,Walk through history
"August 24, 2016",We visited in the morning and went straight to the Crown Jewels while everyone else was lined up for a beefeater tour. There was no line and  we were able to enjoy the exhibit without crowds. Within a half hour the line to get in was an hour long! Give yourself a good half day to spend at the tower to see everything there is there.,Very Interesting
"August 23, 2016","Loved our visit to the Tower, very interesting !!!... The line to the Jewels is very long. The Museum is very nice, but take comfortable shoes, theres a lot of stairs going up and down. ",Meet the Raven Master
"August 22, 2016","Tower of London was a great experience.  Get in line for the Crown Jewels early or when there seems to be a lull.  There is a lot of living history here in the form of costumed actors playing the parts of knights, staged fights etc.  Be sure to find the Raven Master and learn the story of the Ravens.  This was one of our favorite stops in London.",Too much queuing 
"August 21, 2016","Far too much queuing for very little to see, exhibits placed in doorways making progress slow, didn't get to see crown jewels as would of been waiting for more than 2 hours, more child orientated exhibits although the white tower was interesting it definitely not worth the entrance fee!. ",Crown Jewels and Torture!
"October 30, 2016","The Tower of London was a really cool place to visit. You can go through the rooms and read about some of the people that were held prisoner in the tower, see the crows that they keep on the grounds, see the armory as well as the crown jewels. The one downfall is that there are a huge number of people there at all times so it can be crowded and difficult to read things. It was very neat though! It is right next to the Tower Bridge as well so you can get a good view from the tower and walk there after.",Amazing History
"October 25, 2016",Tower of London was quite impressive. Having arrived in late September there were no long lines for tickets or entrance. The Yeoman Warder tours are exceptional and included with ticket price. DO NOT MISS these! The Crown Jewels are also quite impressive and worth seeing. I would recommend going to the Crown Jewels first as this can become somewhat crowded and then taking the Yeoman Warder tour. There are various reenactors mostly leading school groups but if you have the chance maintain a respectful distance and listen to them. There are two Queen's Royal Guardsmen stationed outside the Jewel House. They are quite easy to photograph but please be respectful. These young men and women are soldiers and are actively serving guard duty and have worked hard and sacrificed much for this service. The White Tower artifacts of armor and weaponry are fantastic! A trip to The Tower of London should be a top choice of things to do.,Summer visit to London
"October 20, 2016","One of the ""must see"" tourist sites in London. Approaching from metropolitan London is a bit of an anticlimax as it is unimpressive among modern skyscrapers. But to go inside the walls is to be transported to the 11th century. Lots to see and do inside, so allow at least 4 hours inside to see the Fusilier's museum, the Traitor's gate, walk the walls, and of course, the Crown Jewels. We were there on a lovely summer day, so there was a bit of a crowd, but highly recommend taking one of the tours guided by uniformed yeomen. These folk are friendly, knowledgeable, and quite funny (on purpose). ",Amazing Visit
"October 19, 2016","Not only do you have all the history of Kings and Queens and ne'er do wells who were imprisoned here but it is an incredible look back at the human rights allowed/not allowed people in those days.After getting all the history you can take, go look at the crown jewels. It is hard to believe the stones in some of those pieces!! HArder still to believe they are actually allowed to leave the Tower security! LOL",Must see tour
"October 17, 2016","This was one of the last tours we did in London because I was not sure whether it was worth the time.  We were going to do a London Walks tour but arrived too late.  Not a problem since the Tower Beefeater guards do hourly tours.  John was our yoeman and he was fabulous for setting the mood, gave us good history, humor and sense of both awe and adventure.  We spent another hour walking around on our own including the tour of the Crown Jewels.  Well worth a trip out of your way.  Stop by St. Paul's, a reasonable walk on your way back to the center of town",Tower Of LOndon
"October 12, 2016","Get to the tower nice and early. Don't just go off when you go through the gates wait at the beefeater free guided tour. The tell you what the building are and what happened the also tell you a few secrets that you wont hear just wondering around alone, Our tour guide, Clive, informed us well and contained comedy. After the tour find somewhere to eat then go exploring you need about 4 hours in the tour, including the tour, to have a good look.","Go for the History, stay for Beefeater Dave!"
"October 12, 2016","This was my favourite attraction in London. I very highly recommend taking one of the free guides by a Yeoman Warder. If you're lucky, you'll have one by Beefeater Dave! The guide was informative, hilarious, and fun! Afterwards make sure the have enough time to see the rest, it's definitely worth it.",Great YeOman Warder tour
"October 11, 2016","This is an iconic London attraction. We did the Yeoman Warder tour which departs just inside the main entrance in the moat. Yeoman Warder Jason Woodcock was brilliant and I think one of the best guides I have encountered anywhere in the world. He was knowledgeable and funny, dastardly and gritty. He made hearing the gruesome history of the tower entertaining and informative. His wit was spot on and lightened the mood when history nasties engulfed us. I came away feeling I had seen a first class show and I wanted more. I was disappointed though in the crown jewels exhibit. Not in the displays but after having such a colourful guided tour around the tower the jewels felt lacking (which is why I'm giving this 4 instead of 5. Fyi YW J Woodcock deserves 5****** out of 5). The armouries were interesting but again having an amazing guide bringing it all to life would make it all so much more exciting....especially for kids. I will definitely return, it needs a full day to take in all it's horrible atrocities.",A rich history lesson 
"October 5, 2016","Well worth the visit! The Tower of London dates back to 1050 and is a world heritage listed site. Loved the Yeoman (Beef Eater) tour! You can just join one as they start every 30 minutes. The Yeoman is a serving member of the military and an excellent history buff- delivering a pretty entertaining romp through the history of the tower, its grounds and the mayhem, beheadings and murder that occurred over centuries of successive kings and queens vying for power and riches. The Crown Jewels are housed here and yes they are real and incredible! You won't be disappointed spending 2-3 hours here. ",Incredible Experience
"October 5, 2016",Really enjoyed the tower of london.  It was beautiful and historical.  I loved seeing the crown jewels and exploring all of the grounds.  Must see when visiting London!,Relive history
"August 4, 2016","Loved seeing so much of history in one place.  Did an overview of the Tower of London by taking a tour with London Walks.  They talk about the building get of the tower and all the history that has occurred here, highlighting the places where the prices in the towers bodies were found, where Anne Bolyen and others lost their heads, where the prisoners were kept, and the Famous Ravens.  They leave you to see the crown jewels and continue on your own.",Great experience 
"August 3, 2016",I went with a group of friends and family to the Ceremony of the Keys. The guard who walked us through it was very knowledgeable. The whole ceremony only takes about 30 minutes but definitely well worth it. Would recommend booking this well in advance as it books out quickly and they don't allow very many people on this tour.,Love the audio tour
"August 2, 2016","Purchasing the audio tour guide was worth it. Loved doing the tower at our own pace.  There are group tours by a live tour guide, but it can be very busy and loud.   So hearing the guide can be difficult.  Easy to spend 2 or more hours.  Go 1st thing in the morning to see exhibits and avoid the crowds. ",Amazing History and Diversity of Activites
"July 31, 2016","Returning here after several years, so that my mother could visit as well.  We arrived here shortly after it opened.  We made a beeline to the crown jewels, which was definitely a great idea.  We were able to walk around them a couple times due to the lack of crowd.  Following our visit there, we returned to near the entrance to take the Yeoman Warder tour.  The tour was information and entertaining.  We had a large group of people from around the world in the tour from South Africa to the Americas, and all were included.  Definitely made for a memorable visit.  Following the tour we went through a couple of the exhibits.  I wish we had a bit more time to visit, but wanted to get a few more things in today.An amazing feature of the Tower to me is the diversity of activities.  There seems to be something for every age and every interest.",Yeoman Clive and his 1 hour tour
"July 30, 2016","If you get a chance to have a guided tour while at the tour, definitely try to find Yeoman Clive! He conducted our tour of the Tower at 10 am. He was very informative, loud, engaging, and patient with an unruly, over-questioning child.  Mad props to Clive and the other yeomen who are former military and the queen's body guard!",Historical place 
"July 28, 2016","A great place to explore and learn about history of England. The guards' tours are exceptionally fantastic with the right amount of British humour.  It might sound rather expensive at about 22 £ but if you buy a membership for about 40£ you get free access to 5 royal palaces, including Banqueting palace in London. Or you can try to find slightly cheaper tickets online. Make sure to allocate a long time to this excursion because there are many things to see and several different tours to take part in. You can spend a whole day there and have a picnic in the moat!  ",The Guided Tour is Excellent
"July 27, 2016","I was lucky enough to enter the Tower of London grounds just a few moments before a free guided tour began.  My guide spoke loudly, knew how to lead a large group, and told a story of the Tower of London in an entertaining manner.Women seem intrigued by the Crown Jewels.  I found them uninteresting, but it may be worth waiting in the long line just so you won't feel that you've missed anything.I liked the White Tower, which had many displays of arms and armor.",Give yourself plenty of time
"July 27, 2016","We went as a part of a morning tour which was great to get your lay of the land, but we found ourselves wishing we had more time.  The beefeater's intro is short and good.  They tend to point you towards the crown jewels, which was neat to see (and like the fact they have a conveyor belt to keep the gawkers moving along), but we wish we would have hit the white tower up front as there were so many levels and a lot to take in.",Just as good second time!
"July 22, 2016",Visited this attraction only yesterday having been here 14 years ago. It was just as enjoyable this time with two of our children. Fantastic tour guide Dave the Beefeater was our guide and as before the Beefeaters make great tour guides of the tower. Big number of visitors but no queuing. So much history to digest. We spent approximately three hours at the Tower of London as it was a beautiful day a must see when in London!,Excellent 
"July 22, 2016","Started off with a Yeoman Warder tour where we were guided around for about an hour by the excellent Jaise. It was an entertaining and informative tour and left us in the middle of the tower grounds just outside the Chapel. Continued on with the arms exhibition inside The White Tower, then on the the Crown Jewels and finally ended it with a bit of a walk on the walls. I'm not much for jewels but the arms display was impressive - don't miss it, and don't miss the Yeoman Warder tour either. Definitely one of the more interesting things to do in London. ",Twilight Tour was a highlight
"April 7, 2016","Toured around the Tower complex during the day, taking both the guided tour with a Yeoman Warder followed by self guided tour with the audio guide.  Enjoyed it all.  But then came back for the Twilight Tour and that was the icing on the cake.  Small group (out day time tour group had to be close to 100 people, this was only about  30), very personable guide, heard some wonderful stories.  Included some of the ""Creepy"" stories you'd expect but the guide wasn't trying for shock value, it was clear that he truly wanted to engage people.  It is only available on Sunday evenings and does cost extra, but it was it.",Amazing history
"April 6, 2016","What a great  experience.Magnificent collections of all you can imagine. Weapons, jewlery, and crafts. It was so inspiring that I will comeback next time i m in London. Highy recommended.",A must visit
"April 4, 2016",One of the most important historic sites in the city and a must visit.To understand the full history of the city you should first visit this place.There are always lots of people but be patient and enjoy.,So much interesting history
"March 30, 2016","We visited on a beautiful sunny day. We saw a live play (watching Jacobites trying to escape) and saw the Crown Jewels, which are marvelous. This is a must see city castle. The yeomen were very nice and accommodating for photos. I loved sharing this experience with my children as I had when I was little. ",Historical
"March 28, 2016","Every time I visit the Tower, there is always something new that catches my eye. It's a site full of historical information.",Not for the wheelchair user
"March 24, 2016","Tough going, mainly cobbled and where there were fairly flat pavestones they were covered with obstacles. Access without queuing round the back for the crown jewels. Disabled toilet available if you can get to it over the cobbles. Most other things not accessible. A simple wooden walkway would make a huge difference to wheelchairs.",Go early and reap the rewards!
"March 15, 2016","Spectacular visit when tight for time. We arrived at 9am, when doors open. Bee line to The Crown Jewels and were first visitors!  Had the jewels to ourselves for a bit and within an hour the place was packed.  Take the yeoman Warder tour:  worth it despite the out-of-date jokes (ribbing wives and the like).  Tours start at 10, all the more to see the jewels at 9!  Astonishing spot if you relish history!  Loved it!!",The Crown Jewels
"March 12, 2016","A must visit for anyone who has an interest in English history and or the Monarchy.  The name is misleading as visiting the Tower of London is actually more like visiting an enclosed village with a number of historical sites, shops and cafes situated within. Highlights for me were the crown jewels (amazing and very well displayed), the white tower, and the place that Anne Boleyn (Henry VIII's second wife) was beheaded.  Also the traitors gate which has featured in many historical dramas from the Tudor period of history and the tower ravens were very interesting.",Incredible
"March 7, 2016",There is so much to do in London but this is definitely worth going to.  Be sure to wear comfortable shoes (luckily I did) as you will have to stand in line quite a bit but it is so worth it.  So much history here!   ,A Historian's Dream Come True
"March 7, 2016","I have dreamt of going to the Tower of London since I was 10 years old. Now, mid-20's, I was nervous that the site would not live up to my standards as a history nerd and frequent traveller. I was so relieved and pleased to be proven wrong! Began with a guided tour by Yeoman Spike, who was enthusiastic, highly knowledgeable, friendly, and spoke loudly enough for his crowd of 40 or so. After an hour under his charge (though I would have gladly kept him around all day), the introduction and walk about was done and I wandered off to visit the Crown Jewels, the White Tower, and to walk along the ramparts. It's really quite amazing how free you are to wander this historic place. You'll need a very minimum of two hours to do the site justice.To arrive, take the tube to Tower Hill and follow the signs, you can't miss it. Buy your ticket online for a slight discount and to skip the lines - with a printed voucher (or on a tablet as I did) you can go straight to the group tickets line and pick it up. Then down to the draw bridge entrance where the (free, with ticket) Yeoman guided tours begin (if you're so inclined, which you should be!).A must-see of London.",Beefeater Tour with Lawrence
"February 19, 2020","The Tower of London tour was incredible! Our tour guide ‘Beefeater- Lawrence’ was exceptional! We learned so much about the history of the Tower & the Kings & Queens & all the be-headings! Lawrence was so knowledgable, but more importantly he made us laugh!",Step back in history
"February 19, 2020","A guided tour with a Beefeater is a must, the information you will be given is much better than that found in guidebooks. Ensure you have enough time to see everything. ",Nice but expensive
"February 19, 2020","This is good place to visit with so many things to see from past but again this is expensive, ~30 Pounds per person. I would suggest you take the London Pass and then visit it.Do cover Tower Bridge with it, well you can't skip that if you are going for tower of London.",History Galore
"February 19, 2020","If you love history it’s a great place. Was there for a family trip enjoyed our selfs. Wandered around for a couple of hours. The signage was a little different but no issues. Did not use a tour had fun roaming on our own, but had engaging interactive experiences through out. ",Delving into our history 
"February 19, 2020",Fantastic place enriched with so much history and once behind the walls you forget your in central london at times as it's like a world within itself.  I have been numerous times and still very much enjoy my visits and I have also been fortunate enough to do the ceremony of the keys and have a few drinks in the Beefeaters Pub.  Watching the ceremony I felt like I had gone back in time and got shivers in a good way totally immersive 😍😁.  Definitely worth the visit and even walking around outside afterwards is also very gratifying and seeing gower bridge.  I recommend getting a Thames river boat afterwards so lovely 😁❤,A good piece of history
"February 18, 2020","My visit to the Tower of London was both educational and fascinating. It was well organized with something to learn at every  turn, I would advice one gets the audio guide for abit more information and definitely take the Yeoman warden tour which gives a baseline to where to go next. Of course, the crown jewels was a slight to behold and the many towers had something learn. It is a testament to man's ingenuity and engineering feat architectural speaking. One must not forget the piece of history one would learn along the way.",One of my favorites!
"February 18, 2020","This is one of my favorite places to visit in London.  From the impressive view of the outside to all the buildings inside.  We bought our tickets online, to avoid waiting in line there.  It wasn't too busy in October, so seeing the crown jewels wasn't a wait.  ",THIS PLACE IS AMAZING
"November 2, 2015",I never went to the Tower of London on my first trip to London and so this time I made sure I didn't miss it and it was the first place to visit on arrival and it didn't disappoint. It was great. If there is one thing you need to do in London it's to visit the Tower of London.,Worth the time to see!
"October 28, 2015","We took the self guided tour with audio handsets. I think that the guided tour by one of the Beefeaters would have been better and more informative, but it was still so cool! It was alot larger than I expected and there were alot of stairs so I got a good workout. There are amazing views of the London Bridge from the towers.",Getting to be very crowded-but well worth the trip
"October 26, 2015","I had been to Tower of London 3 times and the best way to see it is on your own (not on a tour) so that you have a whole day to really experience it.  I took my 8 year old son and spent the better part of 5-6 hours there which allowed us to see all of the museum areas as well as listen to the Beefeaters tell their tales of the outside grounds.  We have gotten 2 very good Beefeaters who were very funny and they actually seemed to enjoy the tourists as much as we enjoyed them.  If you find that you can not hear the tour guide then maybe wait to get with another group to see if better. You can find them about every 15 minutes. The crown jewels are a must but the other museum have spectacular displays of weapons, armor and other artifacts that are so interesting to young boys and I rather enjoyed it too.  We also took this tour with one of the day long best of London tours that incorporated a lot of London in one day.  This allowed us to go into the Tower of London prior to actual opening to the public and we got to see the crown jewels right away with no wait.  The downside to this is that you only scratch the surface of all that the tower of London has to offer and you don't get to see much more than the crown jewels.  The Tower of London is a must see if you go to London but is best seen on your own time frame.",MUST DO IN LONDON!
"October 20, 2015","Tour to this place is excelent to learn about medieval bloody London. If your are going, you should do the tour guided by a Royal Guard (Befeatter), it is an experience you will never forget, they are all excelent Showmans. This time we did the tour with Dave Phillips and he was excellent.One free tour and this are the two things you should do if you only have one day in London, afterwards you can keep adding things.",Definitely should be on the list
"October 20, 2015",Definitely worth a visit for the history and the sights.  For us (family of 2 adults and 2 teenagers) the highlights were a) the guide who made it interesting and fun for both adults and the children b) the crown jewels and c) the walk on the walls for great views and photos of Tower Bridge.,Go early to the Tower and avoid the queues
"October 13, 2015",All I expected and more - so clean.  Best time to go is early so we didn't have to queue anywhere. Don't need audio guides as map and information extremely helpful.,So many layers of history all in one place.
"October 7, 2015","Plan to give this amazing place a full day. There is so much to take in and enjoy. The school groups had the right idea, bring lunch (or plan to eat in the nice cafe), rest up on a bench and keep going. There is something for everyone, from the beautiful jewels presented along with their symbolism, to the grim and grisly stories associated with the prison. We were able to take our time, wait a few if there were groups, and study everything in as much or little depth as we wished.",Heads will Roll  - but there's more
"October 6, 2015",Beyond the morbidly fascinating history that everyone knows  - the beheading ordered by Henry VIII of his wives #2 Anne Boleyn and and #4 Catherine Howard - there are so many other important historical events that happened on this site. It helps to read up      so you have some understanding of how and why this magnificent set of buildings (including a chapel) have morphed over the centuries. (check wikipedia - so easy and fast) If you don't like history or don't see it's application then better to visit Harrods.,Give yourself plenty of time
"October 2, 2015",The Tower of London was really great and I only wish we allocated more time for it. We did an audio tour which was worth it but took quite a bit of time. I would say half a day or so would allow you to see everything. The Royal Jewels exhibit was entertaining and I'm really glad none of them were in use during our trip. Same with the torture devices ha! ,Tower of London experience
"October 1, 2015","We were thoroughly entertained by our Beefeater Shady (aka. Andy). He had a great grasp of the history of this most magnificent ""castle"" (but never used as such!). The Crown Jewels are breathtaking, to say the least. I highly recommend this tour as a starter for first-time visitors. It doesn't take long, and is full of history for those who are so-inclined. Its proximity to the Tube is great (Tower Hill station on the Circle line).",Good experience
"February 18, 2020",We arrived early morning and there were no queues. We had the audio guide which was good and very informative well worth £5.  There is so much to see at we were there about 3 hours. ,So much history in the center of London!
"February 18, 2020","We went first thing in the morning on a busy late July day and we were able to get in to see the crown jewels with no wait at all. This was quite an amazing exhibit to see. We then perused the grounds and grabbed a cup of coffee at the cafe. We then headed out to see a Beefeater tour. While I though our guide was funny, the stories they tell are quite gory and graphic, so much so, we skipped out after the initial speech. This tour is not for the weak-stomached or sensitive-minded. This was disappointing to me because I had heard so much about this tour. We diverted to take a self-guided tour of the White Tower and this was actually an amazing experience I almost skipped. I would say the White Tower is a must see. We only had a few hours here, but there's enough to fill a whole day here.",Enjoyable
"February 18, 2020",Visited on a pouring wet Sunday With friends They were members so got in free As over 65 we paid £21.50 each No tours the day we went due to the weather Actually spent over 4 hours here so was well worth the money I would advise visiting as early as possible as we didn’t have too long to queue for things like the Crown Jewels Did notice later in da6 queues were much much longer ( not nice on a very wet day ) ,A long stay
"February 12, 2020",My first solo visit with no kids in tow. Enjoyed the beefeater tour then went out on my own.  A good 3 hours later.,experience history at the highest level
"February 12, 2020",loved it...if you like history this is a must take the free tour from the guards ...and and an audio guide...be aware that at the ticket box the sell you the admision and they add a DONATION of 3puonds...this is optional you can ask not to be charged w the admision ticket if you dont want....the cashiers just you   that is the admision price including donation...ADVICE...you can refuse the charge if you want and save 3  pounds...,History and beautiful jewels!
"February 12, 2020",So much history to learn in going to the Tower of London. Make sure to do the Yeoman  Warder walking tour-you will learn so much. The crown jewels are stunning to see along with learning their history. Grateful that we toured at a quieter time of year so we had a more leisurely view of everything.  Allow 2-3 hours to see everything. There are cafes which help in taking a break.,Historical
"February 12, 2020",The tour of the tower of London was so interesting. Our guide was amazing. So much history and information.,Second visit and will be back!
"February 12, 2020","I visited here with my partner last week on a trip to London, I had been previously but seemed to learn even more the second time. The entry fee is expensive but we spent hours there visiting all the different museums and taking in the details of the tower so it was definitely worth the money. The White Tower is absolutely stunning and I seemed to learn so much more in that section this time round!A highlight for me has always been the ravens, they are beautiful, funny birds that are very well kept which is always lovely to see. The Fusilier museum was also a massive hit with us as it fit my partners interests well! The towers were prisoners were kept is always something that gives me chills, the carvings on the walls left by them are unique and a definite highlight when visiting. Some of the views you get from the tower are also amazing, great view over to Tower Bridge!",Awesome trip - a must have on the list!
"February 12, 2020","The 3.5 hour excercise was really impressive and also interesting. The environment offers so many different places (armory, prisoners stories, crown jeweleries). It is a real place to visit. Book your tickets online in advance - pre-information cascaded by the service is excellent - I received useful informations the day before we went there. ",Lovely morning out
"February 12, 2020","Really enjoyed our visit to the Tower of London - highlights were the Crown Jewels and seeing the Ravens fly about. Learnt a lot, staff were very knowledgeable and answered our questions and also very polite. Spent about 3 hours here.",Husband's birthday
"February 12, 2020",Great day out well worth a visit so much history  to learn and beefeaters are lovely nice tea room to have  lunch.,a must in LONDON
"February 11, 2020","history is this place DNA so the visit it's mandatory if you are in London, Queen jewels are amazing",Wonderful guide!!!
"February 11, 2020","I arrived on time for the Yeoman Tour, our guide was Lawrence and he was AMAZING. Higly recommended!!",FAMILY FUN (or singles fun) at a LOW LOW PRICE!!!
"February 14, 2020","Great improv!!! Most fun I ever had on a walking history tour. The Beefeater guide (Beefeater Kelly) was a hoot, interacting with the adults AND THE CHILDREN, keeping everyone's interest for the 1-1 1/2 hour tour. Everyone was on edge, in a good way, expecting Beefeater Kelly to ask a question to the tour group or ask for a response from the tour group. WELL DONE!!! I am going back next month to do it again!!!",Amazing
"February 14, 2020",Seeing the Crown Jewels was memorable. The Crown of Elisabeth II is incredibly beatifull and it makes you understand at once what the Crown Institution is in UK.,Tower of London with 8 and 10- year old children
"February 14, 2020","We opted to pre-book our family ticket from royal palaces website where it cost 62£(2adults and two children). At the door it would have been 77£ and all the other booking sites I looked on didn't seem to offer family tickets so they were much more expensive. Visited on Sunday and arrived there about 11am. No queues. We looked around on our own phase, stopped at the places kids found interesting and went sfitly past ones that didn't interest them. Highlights for kids were the crown jewels, digital archery shooting, ravens and just exploring the battlements. Tower is very impressive with colorful history that our kids haven't studied in school yet but did enjoy hearing the stories. All in we spent three hours at the Tower.",Part of History
"February 13, 2020",We didn't have time to go through the tower to see the Jewel amongst other historical artefacts but looking at the building itself was quite impressive. The tower is quite large and located beside the iconic Tower Bridge so it is fairly easy to find. The masonry and stonework visible from the outside was enough to get me excited about going in. We were told you would need about 1.5-2 hours to go through the tower when booking tickets which was why we didn't end up going in since we would have only had an hour. It was nice that they weren't all about just selling tickets. We went to get tickets at the kiosk but think you were also able to do it online. It was disappointing we didn't get to go in but it is now on the list for the next visit.,Holiday weekend
"February 13, 2020","The tour was overpriced,  the signage in the building with the crown jewels was terrible as it was dark and the wording was too small, wrong colour, too high. For overseas guests some of the items had translations where the majority did not, very poor.",One of THE best days out
"February 13, 2020","Me and my partner visited for the first time on February 12th and absolutely loved it. So fascinating, interesting and sometimes a bit sad to reflect on what happened to some of the unfortunates who met there end here. There is so much to see and explore. From The Crown Jewels to the Fusiliers museum to the White Tower with its immersive activities for adults and children alike. We both love history and if you do, this is the place for you. Wonderful",Historic Building
"February 13, 2020",This place was packed with so much history! We enjoyed our time there and got to see lots of antique items.,Must do the beef eater tour
"February 13, 2020",The Scottish yeoman warder ( can’t remember his name think it was Scot) was just the most funny endearing man who definitely enjoys his job the best part of our trip to London would definitely recommend anyone visiting the tour of London to do one of these tours,Historically amazing 
"February 13, 2020",A must visit in London! The history of this whole place is delivered well by the audio guide. Definitely a great destination ,Definitely a must stop!
"February 12, 2020","This is one of the places that I could have spent so much more time.   It is great that you can wander at will thru the entire castle and grounds.  The crown jewels were disappointing, but over-all, the authenticity of the place was engrossing.","A Must See, but Tricky"
"May 16, 2015","The Tower is a must see, but it is not an easy visit.  Buy your tickets in advance and skip the long, slow ticket lines.  Go EARLY to see the Crown Jewels; if you don't go early it chews up the entire visit.  After the Jewels, seeing the rest of the Tower takes at least two hours.  The audio tour is average, so combine your audio with lectures from the uniformed ""Beefeaters"" for more information. It always helps to read up using a guide book in advance.Right behind the ticket booth (outside the Tower) there are a few sandwich shops that are packed and dirty.  Walk past these one more block parallel to the Thames and you'll see several more that are clean and not jammed.",Worthwhile tourist trap
"May 14, 2015","I had been to the Tower of London back in 1987. The only significant change is the addition of actors giving period performances. Kids will probably really enjoy the performances. There is an enormous amount of history here.  Exhibits are interesting and well laid out. It will take a half a day to get through everything. History buffs will love this stuff. Casual tourists might burn to after a couple of hours.  I took a year of British history in college and had some background and understanding as to the importance of this place, and the people and artifacts displayed. My wife has little interest in the difference between sixteenth century armor and seventeenth century armor.  Two hours here was enough for her.",What have they done??
"May 9, 2015","Very expensive to get in.  We went to the Tower of London about 5-6 years ago and thought it was terrific.  We took our nieces this time as they were keen to see it.  Very disappointing.  Instead of being able to see what it was like walls had been plastered over, rooms were full of information boards and television screens.  Gift shops, gift shops, too many gift shops.Included in the admission was a ""voluntary"" donation.  If you did not want to pay the donation you had to actually state so.Would not be taking anyone else there.",Go Early; Explore it all
"May 9, 2015","What can I say that a million people haven't said about The Tower of London? It's amazing. It's incredible. And it embodies and immortalizes centuries of utterly fascinating British history.Get a tour from one of the Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters) and consider if that's all you have time for, or if you want to go in-depth enough to take advantage of the audio tour that also is offered. The audio tour is good (and it has optional ""extras"" in addition to the straight tour). Through it, you'll get a thorough introduction to areas that the warders don't visit, so it's not a bad idea to do both.Tips:* Buy tickets in advance* Get there early in the morning* Head to the Crown Jewels Exhibit first* Then take the Yeoman Warder tour* After that, if you have time, pick up the audio tour device and explore the interiors of buildings, the open spaces, etc.* Consider visiting The White Tower (the central building) next, and then the side buildings afterwards* NOTE: The audio tour does give info on The Crown Jewels, so if you think you will be getting it the device, pick it up when you get there.",History +++
"May 4, 2015",Great place to visit for history my 3rd visit there and still haven't managed to see everything . I went with a elderly father and there are a lot of steps for a elderly person to manage but you can do it slowly ,Good place to learn about some of British history
"May 2, 2015","Really good place, if you wish to learn a bit more about British history firsthand. Authentic furniture, cold ancient walls, and great stories brings this place on the top of London attractions.",Not been in a Long While !!!
"May 2, 2015",Just amazing History of my Country !!!! And got a Boat back to Westminster from Tower Pier.........which was an awesome experience in it's self !!!,STAMPS
"May 2, 2015","Whilst we had an enjoyable visit to ""The Tower"" we just wanted to make others aware of the stamps.  We purchased a book of Tower stamps to send postcards to relatives/friends in the UK.  Having asked if the stamps were okay to use and were told yes, we were really disappointed to find out that when received by the receipients, a charge was made.  Apparently the stamps are not for UK use.  When we contacted the Tower about this, whilst very polite and pleasant, we were told to take it up with the Post Office. Just a word of caution, the stamps aren't cheap (£1.00 each) plus the postcard plus the surcharge incurred by recipients make the pleasure of sending postcards a very expensive activity.",A must see for the London visitor
"April 30, 2015","Great tours, plenty of room to explore--this is one of the best Historic Palaces of London.  Get there early before the crowds and tours arrive for the best experience.",Don't miss this tour
"April 30, 2015","The tickets provide a yeoman warder - a knowledgable guide w more than 22 yrs of service in the military - he provided an extensive tour - with fantastic info - it lasted 45 min which was perfect to then visited the Crown Jewels ( on the property / the knights and armory museums - the other parts to this "" village"" - don't leave London without this visit! ",Be sure to have a beefeater guide!
"February 18, 2015","After living across the river from this world renown landmark, I finally made it for a proper visit. It's a great place to go with kids - the history is interesting and the tour isn't too too long! I didn't see the crown jewels - the line was too long the day we went, but I am sure they would be great to see. The cafe which opened on the premises is wonderful too - great for just a drink outside or a coffee and lovely cakes! Fed worth the time and money! ",Anglophiles and History Buffs will enjoy!
"February 14, 2015","Though your ticket will be pricey and the line to see the Crown Jewels will be long, there is so much romantic and tragic history packed behind these walls, it's a must see. I skipped the audio tour and opted for a guided tour by a Beefeater instead. They have an immense amount of knowledge and a way of bringing history to life that you just can't get from an audio guide. The Beefeater tours are free (included in your pricey ticket to enter the grounds) so you might as well make use of them. ","A ""must do"" in London"
"February 10, 2015","Really, what can be said about this place that has not already been written?  Situated in the heart of London, The Tower area has been the scene of some of England's most horrific events but also houses the fantastic crown jewels.  My advice- 1) Go early in the morning to avoid crowds.  Even then, it will be busy during the summer months. 2) Get in the line for the Crown Jewels even if it looks so long you think you will never get in.  It moves along at a pretty good clip.  3) Take the time to stop and listen to some of the stories being told by the Beefeaters.  They are entertaining and fascinating.",A surprise for me
"February 4, 2015","Typically, I often carry very little interest in history, and am usually drawn to more modern attractions. While I did have an interest in going to the Tower Of London (first trip to London, I have to at least go see it), my girlfriend was EXTREMELY looking forward to seeing it. Honestly, I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would have. The Yeoman we had for our tour was delightful and entertaining. Between that, the White Tower and the Crown Jewels, there really is at least a little something for everyone. Be prepared for long lines depending on the time of day that you go. Luckily for us, we went first thing on a Wednesday morning. Seemed to help a lot!",Crown Jewels!  A Must See!
"February 4, 2015","Traveled to see the Tower with my two young adult children and some of their friends.  Part of the tour is led by a Beefeater (who takes you into the chapel to give you an overview of the history of the Tower of London).  After you are on your own to wander the rest or use headsets for more detail.  Gloomy rainy day, but it's fine because you go in and out of buildings.  Line to see the crown jewels is long, but they are smart enough to wind you through interesting photos as well as a film of Queen Elizabeth's coronation.  Septors and crowns with huge jewels set in them, so cool to see in person!",Gives You Goosebumps!
"February 4, 2015","Give yourself a lot of time when traveling to the Tower of London!  There is so much to see!  Whether you be a weapons/armor nut or just like hearing the old stories, there is something for everyone.  As soon as I entered, I got a feeling like I was back in time.  It literally gave me goosebumps!  Like you can feel the spirits passed.  There was so much to see, if I ever get to London again, I will definitely go a second time!",Get there 9am
"January 21, 2015",We arrived at opening time and it was fantastic we practically had the place to ourselves. And no cue to see the Crown Jewels   The cafe was lovely but cakes expensive.  This is must on any visit to London,Tips to avoid the lines when visiting with small children
"January 15, 2015","Arrive as the Tower opens. If you are a family with multiple children and plan to visit more than one Royal Palace (excluding Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle) you should invest in an Annual Pass. In fact, you should visit more than one palace because they are each excellent in their own right (check out my Hampton Court review). I have not been to Kew Palace and Gardens in years but its great in the summer.You can purchase the Annual Pass ahead of time and it will be sent to you. If you have a UK bank account you can save even more by paying with your debit card. Of course, I did not follow my own advice and arrived without having bought tickets but I circumvented the ticket line by going to the Welcome Center to buy the pass (they may even sell regular tickets but I'm not sure). If you arrive early you will avoid the lines to enter the Tower- just a few minutes makes a huge difference, so I cannot emphasize enough that you must arrive as the Tower opens to the public. Next, make a beeline straight for the Crown jewels- this way you will stand in line for half an hour or less instead of the crazy lines later in the day that rival Disneyland Attractions. Stop at the Welcome Center before you enter to pick up an Activity Pack- we all enjoyed it- it was an excellent little scavenger hunt with a little history. Don't let the lines deter you, just plan well, use the activity pack and hit the gift shop to make each tyke happy as they exit.",So much History - a must see when in London
"January 12, 2015","Lots of reviews for this, so I will try and focus on some tips.  Buy tickets online prior to your visit if you can.  It avoids all the hassles if it is busy and cuts the stress.  Try and get there for when it opens and do the Crown Jewels first.  This bit gets busy and if (like us) you like going more than once on the moving escalator past the jewels, you need to get there in good time.  Don't bother with the audio guides.  These cost £3 per person and instead of guiding you round the whole site as I have experienced at other places, they are limited to the Crown Jewels, Dungeons, and a couple of outside areas.  Two of the audio spots are also in the outdoor areas, so if weather is bad, you won't want to stand and listen!  Buy a guidebook instead.  Has all the info and is great to take home and read after your visit with a glass of wine!  The history in the Tower is practically pouring out of every stone.  It is awesome.  We took two children with us and there was plenty to keep them busy.  The Ravens and Beefeaters were a huge hit, and the wall walk was great too.  We also ate at the new Armouries cafe on site for lunch.  I know you can go out and find places locally, but when you are with children, sometimes that's just a step too far.  We thought the cafe was great - food was lovely and staff were only too happy to help you choose food.  Choice was wide and varied but as we were here in the winter, we all had hot food and it was superb.  This is not a place for people with mobility issues, or those that find walking a problem.  It was a great visit and we will be back!",Lots to see and learn
"January 10, 2015","The Tower is full of great exhibits and there are many great things to see and learn about. The Crown Jewels are fascinating and the armouries in the White Tower always catch my interest. I would like an exhibition to tell more about some of the characters who were imprisoned there or met their end at the Tower, but maybe I just like the gore! The walls offer a great walk and a chance to look out across the Thames and the London skyline. I went with a school group and had a student who felt unwell and the staff were helpful and supportive. I only wish that the poppy exhibition had still be there as that looked amazing and I would have loved to see it in person.",Fantastic historical sight but too busy
"October 26, 2014","We went to the Tower of London on a Sunday during half-term when many people were visiting to see the remembrance poppies. Apparently there had been 30,000 visitors the day before. Luckily we had bought our tickets on line before we left home so we didn't have to stand in the long queues at the ticket office. Nevertheless, there were still queues at the main entrance. We thought about visiting the Crown Jewels but a Beefeater told us that the queues were 1 hour 45r minutes, the longest he had seen in his nine years working there. We waited until later in the day and only queued for 1 hour - it was worth it though - the Jewels are spectacular. We also visited the White Tower which has interesting armoury exhibits, including the suits of armour of a number of English kings. Beware though, that there are lots of steps on narrow spiral staircases. We also walked along part of the ramparts and visited a number of towers along the way. There are some interesting exhibits and good views of Tower Bridge and the Thames. However, there were further queues to get through some of the narrow walkways and staircases. There were also queues to get into the one café in the Tower. We discovered that the queues were caused by people waiting for the coffee machine and that there were no queues to be served food or to pay. There is quite a lot of choice of food, of good quality and reasonably priced. There are plenty of tables which are cleaned regularly. One problem with the Tower is the lack of toilets. There are nowhere near enough for the number of visitors - there were long queues. If you want to visit, arrive either early or late to minimise queuing, and buy tickets in advance (its cheaper and avoids queues).",Poppies!
"October 26, 2014","Visited Tower Hill to view the poppies (can be viewed from outside the Tower complex for free). Absolutely stunning and very evocative. Go and see asap, they will only be there until November 11th! (Come out of Tower Hill tube station, turn right and cross road towards the Tower.) ",See the poppies while you can
"October 24, 2014","The poppies are amazing as a spectacle, fascinating as a work of art, and very moving as a tribute.  it's worth walking along the river side, which is less popular - you're closer to the poppies there.",The poppies are spectacular
"October 23, 2014","This is a must see.The tribute to the fallen is quite a fantastic display and very moving.After the Armistice Day celebrations, they will disappear... so don't miss them now!",Poppies
"October 22, 2014",Went to view poppies and visit Tower. Crowded but well worth visit. Information good though wouldn't recommend visiting at present with a buggy as crowds not buggy friendly,Poppy Display
"October 22, 2014","Went up especially to see the 800,000 ceramic poppies. What a display. You don't need to pay to visit the Tower as the display can be seen from all the public access roads around the Tower of London. Well worth going to see.",WW1 Poppy Experience
"October 21, 2014","When we got near to the Tower of London there was such an enormous queue that we decided to avoid an inside visit and just kept to the pavement and take a long walk around the outside to see the Ceramic poppies. The number of the poppies is just overwhelming, when you consider that each one planted represents a lost life. The red being a great contrast against the so green lawns surrounding the tower. I enjoyed the visit, but obviously it was a very busy site, the location was overloaded with people.",Went to see the Poppies...did so much more....
"October 21, 2014","I'd never been to the Tower of London before (typical scenario when its on your doorstep!) but having purchased a Poppy wanted to go and see the display for ourselves so took the family during  half term. We started with a Yeoman Warders guided tour - which was exceptional....interesting, funny and and educational! This should be on everyone's list of MUST DO's if you are a 1st timer as you'll lean so much more about the history of the place and then know where to go afterwards. Our Yeoman was also hilarious in his story telling...The White Tower, Crown Jewels and Wall Walk are also must see / must do's and the Cafe is an example of how to do mass catering well (ie: It doesn't have to be greasy microwave rubbish) with all the food sourced from the various food markets around London and presented / prepared well.The staff everywhere were always very helpful and polite and there are various displays and acts around to educate and entertain in equal measure. Finally the Poppies are every bit as good as the pictures you have seen....just better in person !",A MUST in London
"October 20, 2014","The home of English Kings and Queens since the 11th century, where they lived and died, were imprisoned and ruled, a scene of murder and gruesome torture. A fortress, palace, armoury, place to keep your money (ie the Jewels and a mint), the list goes on and on. This is one of, if not THE major sight in London. No Theme Park effects (apart from the odd person in period clothing), no modern tourist trappings, this is the real deal. Even if you have the slightest interest in English heritage or history this place is fascinating. A better deal at 20 pounds entrance fee you will not find in London for the crown jewels, Henry VIII´s armour, the White Tower (built by William the Conqueror) with a beautiful chapel, the beefeaters, the ravens plus more. Top tip: wait for the guided tours by one of the beefeaters just inside the entrance, you´ll get a really good synopsis of the history and quite a few laughs into the bargain. Just one word of warning, this place is not particularly handicap friendly as there are no lifts in the old buildings (for obvious reasons) and a lot of steps in them, but just soaking up the atmosphere here is worthwhile.",The Poppies Made It
"October 18, 2014","We went on a coach trip, primarily to see the poppies and, by co-incidence, chose the day of the Queen's visit.  We didn't see her as she had left by the time we arrived but the ceramic poppies are an amazing site.  You actually can't really see much of them from within the Tower - a free walk around the outside gives you the best view.However, the trip included a visit to The Tower itself which I had not been to for 60 years.  There's plenty to see and most is very well presented.  It was obviously a busy day but didn't appear overcrowded except perhaps for the Crown Jewels.  Here, standing on a conveyor for a small part of the exhibit kept the queue moving and is something which maybe could be extended as some people did appear to linger obstructing the view of others.We had an interesting talk and visit to the Church by Andy Merry, one of the Yeoman Warders, whose mixture of humour and facts, taught me more of our own history in 20 minutes than I remember from 10 years or so of history lessons at school.All in all, well worth the visit and we left wondering why we tend to avoid our own heritage that foreign tourists make a beeline for.",A moat full of Poppies
"October 17, 2014","Couldn't leave London without seeing the Poppies at the Tower and it was well worth the journey across town. Don't know how many there are at this time but the aim is for 888,246 ceramic poppies by 11th November, one for each military death during the First World War. You don't need to go into the Tower to see them as there is viewing all around the tower. We went early evening and it was very moving, a sea of red.  The display will be dismantled after the 11th November so if you can, visit soon. Its a once in a life time.",Poppies to commemorate British lives lost in WW1
"October 15, 2014",It is free to visit and see the hand crafted poppies being placed in the moat of the Tower of London. Each poppy represents a life of one of the British service personnel who died in World War 1. When we visited on a busy Saturday afternoon we were struck by the beauty of the poppies but also by the quietness of the people standing and looking.  Very thought provoking,An absolute must do
"October 12, 2014",I literally got goosebumps standing at the Traitor's gate and imagining a teen aged Elizabeth Tudor walking up the steps.  It is almost overwhelming to look at brickwork from 1068 and imagine William the conquerer sitting in the same space. ,A must see!!!!
"October 11, 2014","We were greeted by a sea of red ceramic poppies spilling out of the tower and covering over a hundred yards of grass around the tower wall perimeter. Crossing into the tower we had the best tour guide, he was hilarious, informative dressed in beefeater attire and gave us a wonderful tour around thd grounds. This place filled with such incredible history, after 4 1/2 hours we still hadn't seen it all. I definitely will be revisiting when we come back.",Sea of Poppies and Roll Call
"October 9, 2014","Whilst on a day trip to London up to November 11 a trip to the Tower of London is a must!The sea of Poppies is a breath taking sight! More so as night falls.This exhibition is free. The poppies are right around the tower and the cascade from a window tumbling down the wall is lovely.However you can not fail to be moved as you remind yourself that each poppy represents a life lost to war.The poppies themselves are quite large and one is displayed in a plastic bubble beside a sign giving details of the exhibition. We went not to visit the Tower and Crown Jewels on this visit (alas time would not allow)The purpose of our visit was to hear a relative's name being called during the 6.25 p.m. roll call of the dead of World War 1.A small crowd gathered and a member of the armed forces together with a bugler also from the armed forces (on this occasion the Royal Air Force) marched to the centre spot and a list of over 100+  names was read out including my relative's and from countries as far as New Zealand and Canada.The crowd were silent and each name could be clearly heard.The poem ""We will remember them"" is spoken and the last post played.Names are submitted on line and you are e-mailed with the date and list of  all names to be called.We were notified a week after submitting our relatives details.    Get there early for a good position down from the steps leading to the path around the Tower.Each poppy is available for purchase and we have one ordered.",Ceramic Poppies - Must See!
"October 8, 2014","As part of my 65th birthday present from my wife, we visited the Tower of London. We took the tour with a member of the Yeoman of the Guard, very funny, irreverent and hugely entertaining - recommend it. However, the poppies are just awesome - they have to be the must see exhibit this Autumn. Very moving, very beautiful, takes your breath away.",Go and See the poppies it's Free
"October 5, 2014","The poppy field around the tower to commemorate the dead of World War I should not be missed , there will be c 900000 ceramic red poppies when 11 November comes. A very moving and spectacular  tribute to those who gave their lives for freedom. You do not need to pay for entry to the Tower to see them all.",Could have spent the whole day here.  Take the Beefeater's tour!
"October 1, 2014","I probably have more pictures of the Tower of London than any other single attraction from our 2 week trip to England.  We arrived as soon as they opened and the place was fairly quiet for the first hour.  It got more crowded as the day wore on.Knowing what I know now I would visit the crown jewels first if you arrive early, then take the first available Beefeaters tour.  This will give you a good overview so you can explore on your own later.  The crown jewels didn't interest me, but I know they do most others.  You stand on a conveyor belt that glides you past crowns, sceptors, rings, and lots of bling.The Beefeaters tour was the BEST!  John was our guide and he not only had a great sense of humor, his voice was loud enough that we could hear him.  Our tour group was large (that's why I recommend doing the tour as early as you can to keep the group smaller).  John took us on a one hour trip with great stories about the tower, and the only way to see the chapel is on a tour.  (John, you know you did well because we're not calling you Jack - the name of our guide if we had a bad review.)There is more to see than just the tower itself and the crown jewels.  The chapel holds the remains of Anne Boleyn, Thomas More, Catherine Howard, and others and seeing it brought home how desolate one's fate was if you met your end in the courtyard around the corner.  The dungeon is a little cheesy but worth a few minutes.  The tower itself holds lots and lots of armory.  The grounds are beautiful and you have good views of Tower Bridge.  Be sure to allow plenty of time.  We spent 5 hours here and wish we had a little more.",Ages of History Very Well Displayed
"September 23, 2014","The Tower of London is amazing and GIGANTIC. This attraction was covered on our London Pass so again, no waiting in line to buy tickets. We just walked right up to the front gate and the lady there scanned our cards and let us in. The adio guides are available for a small fee and they also have guided tours given by the Yeomen. We opted to go with the audio guides on this trip because the guided tour was just starting when we arrived and it was very crowded. So with the audio guides, you just go where you want to within the grounds and hit the corresponding number to hear about that area. In this way, we were able to jump ahead and avoid the big crowds. Only parts of the Tower have audio guides so for some of it, you just look at the displays and enjoy the sights. Well, try to enjoy. Some of the things were quite gruesome. They have a torture exhibit that is small, but does get the point across. I wouldn't have wanted to be put in the ""Scavanger's Daughter"" that's for sure! The crown jewels were of course, very popular. Because of this, you are put onto a little conveyer belt and just glide along slowly as you watch the jewels go by. They are very beautiful and lit well so that they just dazzle but I was not really into the big crowds there. The Tower can feel a little overwhelming at times. At least it did for my mom and I. Every time we walked out of one area, we found ourselves somewhere entirely new and it seemed a little endless now and then. But there are several shops and a nice cafe near where they keep the ravens so we stopped by for some tea and a sandwich and then continued on with our sightseeing. Also, there is the amazing poppy exhibit that will be completed by the 11th of November. It was amazing to see and we took lots of pics of them and there is a temporary exhibit inside the tower that tells you about how they are being made. Very moving. Honestly, I don't know if we even saw everything here as it was a lot to take in all at once. If time allows, I would suggest seeing part of the Tower, and then coming back another day for the rest. If not, then pick out the areas you want to see ahead of time and hit those. Too much at once and your eyes start to glaze over. Even mine did a little and I absolutely love history.",Blood swept lands and seas of red
"September 10, 2014","This is an amazing installation of ceramic poppies in the Tower Of London moat which you can see without charge. They are being added to daily until 888,246 poppies, each representing a British fatality of WW1, fill the moat. They will be removed after 11 November so you only have 2 months left to see this powerful and moving display. Wish I'd gone at sunset to witness the the Last Post being played and individual dedications being made.",Poppies At The Tower
"August 4, 2014","We just went to see The Poppies. Each one represents a life lost in WW1. Very moving and very beautiful to look at, and free! There are about 100000 there at the moment but by November there will be 860000. We will be back again to see it finished.  Well worth a look at. Gorgeous.",Brilliant place to visit...and wonderful 'Beefeater' tourguide!
"July 28, 2014","We had visited a few years ago but, with new foster children who had never visited London before, decided to go back. Our tickets we prebooked via another website, and it averaged £10 per person (well worth it). The entry queue was about 15 minutes (we visited end July 2014), but this included the security bag checks. We were immediately caught up in the 'Beefeater' tour on the bridge - the crowd was very large, but the guide was impressive, fun, included lots of stories and projected his voice well. It was a great 'quick run' around the grounds with introduction to the history, before being able to spend a few hours going around at our own pace. The guide even pointed out the best 'route' to take to avoid the longer queues. The majority of the Tower is as you would expect - an ancient building, with lots of rooms, stairs and history. This is not a 'tourist attraction' so other than the guides, don't go if you want to be entertained or led through room by room. The crown jewels were beautiful, and reading there history etc added to the impact - we queued for about 15 minutes to get in (have waited longer for a bus personally, so not bothered), which was mainly due to the numbers being managed, so it wasn't too crowded inside and we were able to spend as much or as little time as we wanted looking at everything. Other areas generally include staged 'rooms' or historic/timeline displays, but our kids thought it was amazing and had loads and loads of questions about kings and queens, who died and when.....The only negative we had on the day was the restaurant in the old armoury - for 2 adults and 3 children to eat a sandwich and a drink cost over £50 so recommend taking your own food/drink, or wait until you are outside the Tower.",Amazing
"July 22, 2014","My boyfriend and I spent 4 hours here and still didn't want to leave but had to because we had a schedule to keep. There is so much history here that you need more then one day to take it all in. Not to mention the gorgeous grounds and castle. If you like history that delves deep into kings, queens, knights, torture, executions, royalty, jewels, armor, battles, and life of a Londoner through history this place is for you. I would go back in a heartbeat.",One Of The Top Attractions in London
"July 17, 2014",You can learn so much of History when you visit  Tower of London.  Allow sufficient time for the visit. It is recommended that you start early in  the morning when the Crowds are thin. Crown Jewels are the Star Attraction and you visit it first so that your time is saved. The exhibits are well explained and you learn a lot. We spent nearly four hours and you could spend the whole day visiting the Towers as it has much to offer. An enjoyable visit.,A must see
"July 14, 2014","If you are going to be in London, you must visit the Tower of London.  It is easy to get to (by tube or bus), and you can take a tour given by Beefeaters.  Unfortunately my son did not have much patience and my husband is hard of hearing, so we simply wandered the place on our own and read all the posted information we could.  Do not be discouraged if the line to see the Crown Jewels is about a mile long - that line moved incredibly quickly, and the jewels are definitely something that should be seen!!  The place was beautiful, and the history incredible.  We had a wonderful time there!",Great site
"July 4, 2014","Great place to visit. Get there early and see the Crown Jewels first. We did that and were able to walk right in and look leisurely. Later, the line was very long. Next, take a Yeoman tour. They are great and then you can look more closely at things that interest you after the tour.",Cool- but have a plan!!
"June 18, 2014",Buy your tickets the day or 2 before. Just tell them what day you want to come. The ticket window opens at the same time the tower opens..... So if you buy them in advance- you can get in first thing. Get there 15 min before opens- get in line to go in. Go straight for the Crown Jewels. 20 min after it opened- there was already a line to see them. ( there are signs directing you). They are lovely and should not be missed. After the jewels- join a beefeater tour ( they start by the moat) or walk around on own. It's fun and bigger than you think. We spent 3 hours there and had a great time. ,A dark tower of history!
"June 8, 2014","We were so glad to buy the London pass. Again we skipped the long lines and saw this fabulous castles, learned about the history, executions and learned about the castles' history.  The Queen's jewels were beautiful.  Hint:  go early and get in the line for the jewels first!",Excellent in every respect
"June 3, 2014","It was throwing it down with rain and I was a bit put off by the entry price of £22 per adult, but it was worth every penny! We spent all day on site, there was sooooooo much to see and do! Lots of interesting exhibits, helpful staff and nice short tours around the main sights.  The Crown Jewels were a real treat! On the practical side, lots of loos, cafés and shops ..... Great day out! ",Overpriced and boring
"May 27, 2014","Not a whole lot to say, flushed 20£ down the toilet just to see another heavily commercialized watered down medevil attraction. There wasnt much in the way of sights, just a few plaques and armor suites, I think thr crown jewels were the only interesting feature of the place. Save yourself the time and money and go shopping instead.",Loved the Crown Jewels
"May 18, 2014",Get here early to avoid que's we arrived about 9.45 am and timed it just right. If you leave it till late in the day you may have to que to see Crown Jewels. Armour section is amazing however be prepared to climb ALOT of stairs to see this part. It's on 3 levels or so,The Beefeaters are the Best
"April 23, 2014","Hi There, just had a lovely visit to the Tower of London. The Beefeaters run walking & talking tours every hour os so & well worth hanging out with them. They are good to fill you in all information & history. They shout really loud too so no problems hearing what they are saying. All very smiley & happy in their jobs & it shows. Lovely experience.",Plan ahead and get tickets for the Ceremony of the Keys
"April 21, 2014","It is a no-brainer to go to the Tower of London while you're visiting the city. I'll let everyone else tell you the basics.But a little-known gem of an opportunity is to secure tickets for the Ceremony of the Keys. It has been held nightly without exception for the past 700 years, and tickets are free. BUT, you must write to request them (no online stuff for this storied tradition) in advance. They recommend at least two months prior since the groups they take are small and they do run out.  You can find out all the info on the Tower of London website.So you show up at 9:15 and at 9:30 you're escorted into the Tower grounds by a yeoman guard. The Tower itself has been closed to tourists for hours. (While you're waiting to go in, some people walking by will ask you what you're doing and how you got tickets. Pat yourself on the back when you tell them you had to write to request them two months ago.)Your Yeoman will tell you about the history of the ceremony, explain what you can expect, and probably admit that all the steps that take place are really confusing. I couldn't even tell you what exactly they did--there was some walking back and forth, marching, a bugle, ""Halt! Who comes there?"" The whole thing from entry to the Tower to being escorted out takes 30 minutes. My 13-year-old son said it was the second best part of his trip to London. Don't miss out!",A funfilled day out
"April 17, 2014","I have always intended to return to a visit at the tower of London and I am glad I made the effort. I spent approximately 5 hours in the Tower, making use of all the different tours on offer (The White Tower Tour was exceptionally interesting). The Beefeaters are exceptionally helpful and always visible. There is quite a lot of queuing for various activities so bring something for entertainment at these points. The audio tours were OK - although a lot of faffing round at the start so I am in two minds about whether I would recommend them. All in all a great day out",Resist Beefeater requests for Tips
"April 15, 2014",A very enjoyable and informative tour of the Tower of London completely undermined when paid Servicemen in the form of Beefeater guides touted for tips in the discrete and private surroundings of the Chapel. Shockingly disappointing and inappropriate. ,Get there early!
"February 25, 2014",We had a 12 hour lay over at Heathrow and decided to take ourselves into see the Tower of London.  So easy to get from the airport to the Tower.  We arrived before 9 am and had a coffee and bought our tickets at the kiosk.  By the time the gates opened there was a line forming.  It was still not to bad and we made our way straight to the crown jewels exhibit.  Stunning is all I can say about that part of the tower.  By the time we got out there was a line some 20 minutes long just to get into the jewels.  There are so many different types of exhibits to see.  They are more interactive things for the kids to do then when I was here 25 years ago.  After finishing the White Tower exhibits the line for the crown jewels was over an hour...and this was a Sunday in February!!!So enjoy this amazing piece of history but get there early to avoid as much of the lines as you can.,well worth visiting
"January 31, 2014","very good attraction, and the tube stops just a couple of mins walk away,  you need about 3 hours at least and theres plenty to see, the crown jewels of course being the main attraction... actors in period costume doing little enactments through the day keep things interesting and give one a sense of how it must have been in the past... theres instruments of torture, garments used at occasions of state... the site of beheading etc should you like the darker side of the past as well! you can visit all the little towers inside and walk along the ramparts which give you a really good view of tower bridge which is just outside.there are lilttle tours conducted every 15 or so by the yeoman in costume which are very insightful as well as quite humorous which should not be missed...should also mention that though we usually avoid cafetarias in tourist attractions it was a bit of a rainy day and we ate in the Tower cafe and the stew with dumplings and the pie we had was lovely! if thats not your cup of tea theres a nice fish and chips place just outside the entrance which also looked really good...",TReid to go twice...lines too long and could not get in
"January 17, 2014","So difficult to get in.. we tired twice, once in pouring rain and the 8 lines were 40 people deep.....too many people here.... ",The best tour in the city!
"January 3, 2014","My wife and I spent a 5 day vacation trip in London in June, 2013. We made the Tower of London Tour and it worth every pound that we spend in it. The Beefeaters guided tour is the best tour in this facility. This tours runs every hour and all are well explained and funny. After the tour, we went to the see the crown jewels and are amazing. I'm strongly recommend to do this tour if you are in London.",Worth the price of admission
"December 26, 2013","I'm not sure why the Tower of London gets a bad rap for being ""overrated"". Yes it's fairly small compared to some castles, but has an immense amount of history. The crown jewels alone are worth seeing. I would recommend starting the day with the Yeoman Warder's tour (included in admission) and then picking out where you want to go. The castle also offers some great views of Tower Bridge.",The Crown Jewels and the Yeoman Tour
"July 1, 2013","Buy your tickets online, go to the desk to pick them up about 20 minutes before they open.  When the gates open, go straight to the Crown Jewels before the crowds, then go back to the entry to catch the next Yeoman tour.  The Yeoman tour was very entertaining and one of the highlights for our trip to London.",Take the yeoman's (Beefeaters) tour when you go
"June 29, 2013","I saw the Tower of London back in the 60's so I was happy to do it a little differently this time.  We did the yeoman's tour first and our yeoman (Mitch) was very informative and the tour was a lot of fun.  It gives you a more personal insight into the Tower(s).  Oh, and here's a tip - the answer is 20.  Trust me.  Afterwards we quickly toured the white tower.  I say quickly because we weren't interested in spending a lot of time looking at medieval hardware, etc.  We then toured the tower where Sir Walter Raleigh had stayed (the Bloody Tower I think?) which was of interest since I'm from Raleigh.  If you go up the stairs then be warned that they are very steep and narrow.  We did not look at the crown jewels.  The line was over an hour long and I'd seen them before.  Note:  We bought our tickets at the Traders Post store, which Rick Steves said can be faster when there are lines.  We got a senior discount as well.",DO NOT miss this!
"June 20, 2013","The Tower of London is an amazing place, even in the pouring rain! We purchased the London Pass which would have allowed us to skip the queue but we were there right at opening (9:00am) so we went right in.I would highly recommend going early and heading straight for the Crown Jewels in the Jewel House. We went directly in and were able to spend a good amount of time admiring the jewels ad reading about them. By the time we were finished, the lines to get in was incredible!We took a Beefeater Yeoman tour (free) and he was so good at giving out information and was a stitch to listen to. The tour ends in the Royal Chapel next to the execution site where Anne Boleyn and others lost their heads. The history of this site is truly amazing.The White Tower with it’s armor and weapons display was incredible. The Bloody Tower which contains the executioner’s block and ax and other means of torture. Sir Walter Raleigh’s apartment was there and the staircase where the Boy Princes remains were found. Sounds gory but that is what history is about.",Fun Day out!
"June 9, 2013","My boyfriend and I visited for the first time as adults in May 2013.  We did feel a little guilty about going to a castle without the kids, but it was nice to take our time and read things rather than being rushed along to get to the ice creams at the end!There was a long queue for the Crown Jewels, but it was worth it.  It was good having the guide too, as we read a few interesting facts in there! Overall, it was a great day out and we are looking forward to going again with the kids when they are all a bit older and will be properly interested in history!",Incredible
"May 26, 2013","If you appreciate history, this is a must see. Off all my travels, this was one of the most incredible sites I have seen. Just fabulous. The Yeoman tour is very historical (and accurate). The crown jewels are stunning. And any Tudor fan will appreciate standing in the very spot that Anne Boleyn was killed. This is a must see.",Tower Fantastic - Yeoman Warder Mark outstanding!
"May 18, 2013",A first time visit for us & our 9 & 5 year old children. Blown away by the place. The significance of the history really hits you. Mark Anderson was our Yeoman Warder tour guide and he is just outstanding. Comic timing & repartee brilliant from start to finish. Hussar! ,A cold day at the Tower
"April 24, 2013","Visited London the first week of April, 2013, tthe coldest Easter season in 100 years. So we bundled up and took off. The Tower of London is not to be missed. Took the great advice from others in this forum, went early  and headed straight for the Jewels, while everyone else was waiting for a Yeoman Tour. Even on this cold day there were a good bit of people. Got in without a  wait viewed the Jewels at leasure then went back to catch the tour. The tour is free and fantastic !  Expect to spend 2 and a half to three hours. BY the way, there always seems to be a long line at the tourture display. Like everyone else we joined in. After the longest wait of the Tower we viewed a rack. This would be the only thing I would skip. You can always look up a picture of this torture device on line. In Short, The Tower is the must see for a first timer.",MUST SEE IN LONDON!!  Do the tour with the Beefeater
"April 12, 2013","It's a little overwhelming.  You buy a ticket and people try to sell you a tour book or an audio guide.  They barely mention that real beefeaters offer tours that are included in your ticket.The tour is a MUST!  You will truly miss out of you don't take it.  It lasts 1 hour.  The coolest part?  A Beefeater must have at least 22 years of military experience, still be active military, take a written and oral exam and then show military skills before being hired.  Only 37 Beefeaters in England and they are considered the Queen's personal body guards.  They LIVE in the tower and guard it every day.  So, one of the Queen's personal body guards is your guide.Definitely give yourself at least 3-4 hours to see everything.  While the line to the Crown Jewels may seem ridiculous you should know that it takes about 25-30 minutes if it is filled all the way through the ropes.  Not too bad if you are into a lot of gold and diamonds.",Sadly disappointing and carelessly set out
"April 4, 2013","After happily paying the extortionate entry fee, I was incredibly excited to finally visit the tower of London. As a self-taught history buff, the tower has always topped my list of visits and after visiting as many castles in the UK as my free time would allow, it was finally time to visit the king of historical sites. To say I was disappointed with the experience would be an understatement. The outside is certainly imposing and broods with promise. However, once you get past the hideously modern entry gates, you discover that the history of the castle has been stripped away or locked away and all that remains are bare walls unadorned with information, exhibits or even tapestries! The guide book contains some information which may help the visitor to apply history to the bare buildings but is of course impossible to read while trying to navigate the crowds and towers. The main attraction for me was the history, the buildings and the church. The church was closed to visitors and the buildings were stripped bare and consequently interchangeable. We came across the tower where the Duke of Clarence was drowned in his barrell of wine entirely by accident, hidden under some scaffolding. The crown jewels seem to be the main attraction and although mildly interesting, are only seen briefly after huge queues. It felt as if the tower was more interested in getting your money than educating or entertaining its visitors.Whoever curates this historical site is at best struggling with huge expectation and few resources. They should try paying the visitor fee and viewing the site as a history enthusiast and they might review its presentation.",To many steps
"March 26, 2013",Not disabled friendly to few ramps and cafe closes to early no order in crown jewels display people pushing every way spoiled it for us,Don't skip it
"November 7, 2013",We skipped the tower on our first London trip. This time we went and loved it. The tour was good and the sense of history amazing!! The Crown Jewels were a highlight. ,Excellent; plan on at least two days
"September 28, 2013","This is an incredible experience to learn about the history of Great Britain from the standpoint of its monarchy.  There is so much to see, from the guided tours by Yeoman Warders (commonly called Beefeaters), to the Crown Jewels, there is so much to see and do.  The Yeoman Warders, who are not tour guides, but part of a centuries old tradition of being part of the personal bodyguard of the monarch, are informative and entertaining.  The in-house cafeteria is also worth a visit, whether for a cuppa to warm up on a cold English fall day, or for a plate of traditional fish, chips and mushy peas.  If you want to truly enjoy the experience, and see everything, then you should plan on at least two days at the Tower.  Enjoy!",Bring History Alive At The Tower
"September 24, 2013","Will capture the imagination of medieval and tudor history lovers, jewel lovers, and castle lovers.  I live fairly close to the Tower and it is one of my favourite London landmarks. I think tourists sometimes imagine it will be a huge tower but it is actually a sprawling castle set on the North Bank of the Thames and is right next to Tower Bridge too.Tips: Take a Yeoman Warder Tour and hear the history of the tower through their lively re-tellings. Another way of getting the most out of your visit is if you pay attention to the information placards dotted around all over the place. Also, if you are a resident of Tower Hamlets, take some proof of address and ID with you and you can get into the Tower for just £1 rather than the usual ticket price! (Check online first to make sure this offer is still valid.) Leave plenty of time for your visit as there is a lot to see and learn about (I recommend 2-3 hours.)Things to Visit Inside: The White Tower Exhibition, THe Crown Jewels Exhibition, The Water Gate (where Queen Anne Boleyn was brought into the Tower by boat before her execution.)Location and Amenities: Tower Hill station is the closest tube station. Amenities outside the Tower: There as some cafes and a fast food restaurant (KFC) near the tower (by the ticket office) as well as a couple of Starbucks cafes. There is also a variety of good restaurants 3 to 5 minutes walk away in St Katherine Docks (ask for directions as these are on the embankment level, lower than street level, so not immediately visible from the streets around the castle but they are very close by.) Once you are inside inside the Tower there are toilets and cafes.Nearby Attractions: Tower Bridge and St Katherine docks. Also London Bridge and the London Dungeons are in this vicinity so if you plan on visiting those, maximise your time by doing so on the same day.",HALT! Who goes there!
"September 17, 2013","Love love love the Tower of London!  What a fantastic spine tingling place this is!  Not only is this the home of the Crown Jewels my friends but has to be home to some of THE most important historical moments in British history.  I recommend a self guided audio tour which is at your leisure and of course you can press repeat on those all important facts! Go the extra dollars for the audio - you will thank me later!  Allow at least two hours for this attraction, you can get lost listening to all the stories and dont forget to check out Traitors Gate and the bloody tower with spooky stories of torture!  Take a photo with the ravens which are kept at the Tower Grounds - as the story goes, if there are no Ravens at the Tower of London then the Monarch will fall!",Should be called Tower of Queues-not for young children!
"August 25, 2013","I love history and was so excited to go to the place where so many historic British events have happened but I was very disappointed.  The queues were terrible, to buy a ticket we stood for so long in the pouring rain, at least half an hour and then the young 'lady' at the till selling the tickets was so rude and unhelpful I was tempted to just turn around and say forget it.  I found most of the staff quite sullen and considering where they are working and how many International people they meet, they really do give a miserable impression of this great historic site to the public.  DO NOT TAKE YOUNG CHILDREN!  I saw so many crying children in pushchairs, they looked totally fed up, the stairs and 'landscape' of the whole place is completely unsuitable for babies and buggy's!  Yes some parts were interesting but the sheer volume of people just made the experience disappointing, you are pushing up against hoards of people and waiting and waiting in queues! The cafe is pure chaos, never want to go back there again.  Oh dear I'm trying to remember the good bits, the crown jewels, those 15 minutes looking at them were memorable but I will never go back again.  The ticket was so expensive and for what I paid the experience just not worth it, I wish I had gone to the Victoria and Albert museum instead and that's free.",Don't be too early
"August 8, 2013","I love the Tower and have visited it multiple times.  On this last visit though I learnt something useful for future visits.  Don't be too early.  the bonus is that there aren't queues to get in early, but the very very big downside is that the first Beefeater tour of the day is too large for you to hear your Beefeater if you're at the back of the queue.  Later in the day there seem to be less folk waiting for tours to start.",A great family day out. Steeped in history.
"August 6, 2013","We just fancied seeing the Crown Jewels. We knew the rest of it and thought it would be just another castle to stroll around. How wrong we were. We took advice from earlier reviewers. We arrived at the gates at 9am. The queue was about 50 deep ahead of us. We did as was suggested and made a beeline for the Crown Jewels. It was great to zip straight in - no queues - saunter about, study stuff, see it then go back and see it again. All without the clutter of other people crowding you out. The room where The Queen's Crown is has a moving floor on both sides. This would be to keep the hoardes moving when it gets busy. Which as we found out was just as we exited the building. The next piece of advice we were given by the same reviewer was to take the Beefeater's Walking Tour at 10am. This would allow us access to St Peter's Chapel which you would otherwise not be allowed into. Our Beefeater was Mitch Jones a cunning Welsh linguist who made the tour incredibly humourous and knowledgeable and interesting and he was playing to old folk and kids alike. There is no extra to pay for the tour but you will be asked to donate alms inside the Chapel so take some coins. After this we were free to roam about as we wished. By the time we finished our tour the queue for the Crown Jewels was now hours long and looked incredibly uncomfortable. Thank you to the person who took the trouble to give that initial advice which we took.My advice to you would be to take a portable picnic and carry water bottles enough for you. The prices are high being a tourist venue and London. We ate in the café and a meal of soup for me, cod n chips for the kids and a sandwich for the wife came to around £30.00 The food was really nice and very filling, (even the soup). But if you came on a budget my advice would be to bring a picnic. A bottle of water (very small) is £1.60. You will find plenty of benches dotted around to sit on.The White Tower houses an amazing museum of historical armour and weapons. It is my final ""must see"" at the Tower of London. We got there by tube train. We were there from 9am to 3:30pm and paid £58.89 for our family of 2 adults and 2 kids below 10yrs old - this included the guide book which we only had time to read when we were out and back at the hotel. I can heartily recommend this as a """"Must See"" part of your visit to London.",Favorite
"August 4, 2013",6 and 9 year old and wife and I loved it.  Make to get there by tube then get tix at the shop by the tube stop.  Get there when it opens and go straight to the Crown Jewels which can be seen in twenty minutes.  If you get there later you will wait in line with a few hundred of your closest friends.  Then go back to the entrance near the moat to get a free beefeater tour- we had a marine fellow who was great.  That great tour takes an hour.  See if you can catch the changing of the guard who march right through the crowd- awesome close up opportunity.  Then white tower for 45 mins.  Then wander randomly to some of the side rooms.  Brilliant time.,Love love love it!!!!!
"July 2, 2013","I don't know how you could say anything negative about this incredible historic venue. The Beefmaster's tour was fascinating and set the stage for the remainder of the visit.  The Crown Jewels had a long line but it really moved quickly. Unlike other museums, this one can be enjoyed even with crowds.  The history is incredible, the grounds were immaculate, the gift shops were lovely. I wish I had more time to spend here. Teenagers and hubby enjoyed it just as much as I did.",Busy Venue
"July 2, 2013","Fabulous Venue but too may stairs in the White Tower , Queue for the crown jewels was around 30 mins long, Good beefeaters very knowledgeable. 1 Lemonade & 1 Bottle of Pepsi £4.30 bit steep as the lemonade was only a small cup not a bottle or can  ",A fast conveyor belt
"September 26, 2012","I was so looking forward to my visit here as the last time I went I was about 9 years old.  The grounds and the actual building are amazing when you look at the detail and relate it to its age.  So, we approached the room with the crown jewels only to be told to stand on the conveyor belt so we could be whizzed through as there was so many people.  I hardly had a chance to see them :(  Guess I will just have to keep my memories of when I was a child.",Go early!
"August 21, 2012","We got there when it opened and had a great time. Very few people -- though it was filling up by the time we left. Go straight for the crown jewels (those fill up first) and then wander. Tours by the beefeaters are well done (you need to be on one to see the chapel) and you can join in progress. Armor exhibit didn't have a lot of helpful guidance, but the boys in the group were entranced. Highly recommend doing a Thames cruise afterward...and the restaurant at the tower is terrific (was surprised -- !)",Too expensive and overrated.
"August 20, 2012","We went as a family but we were disappointed with the Tower of London. Mainly the high price leaves you with a sense of being cheated as you only see a tiny amount of it. £20 each to see the Crown Jewels! Other than the exterior of the tower, it lacks any soul and is very boring. Crown Jewels OK but you go round on a conveyer. The sheer volume of people going in means endless queuing. Way too expensive even if entertaining and interesting at times. Embarrassing.Also pet peeve: CLEAN THOSE TOILETS PLEASE!!!!",waited years for this brilliance
"August 18, 2012","id waited to see the tower of london since i was a kid and i wasnt dissapointed, hopped off the tube and walked down to the riverbank to take in tower bridge and the thames before wandering over to by my tickets... everything about it was so so cool, loved every minute",Wonderful Place to Visit
"July 23, 2012","You can honestly spend all day at the Tower of London.  However, we only had a few hours.  We were lucky to get go on a tour with Stephen (who was so great).  If you have time, go on one of the tours hosted by the Beefeater, you will get much more out of your visit.The crown jewls are amazing, and the grounds and history of the place are incredible.  There is a lot to see and do hear.  I would have loved to have more time.  This attractions was well worth the cost.",British history at its finest!
"June 27, 2012","Been here several times…enjoy it each time.  This historic castle, perched on the north bank of the Thames holds within its walls a wealth of British history. Founded in 1055, the White Tower (hence the name, “Tower of London”) was built by William the Conqueror.Don’t miss the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula (where Anne Boleyn is buried); Traitor’s gate, the White Tower, and, of course,  the crown jewels.The Beefeaters are a wealth of information and, bonus, very entertaining!Your admission ticket (£20.90) includes access to the tower, a tour by Yeoman Warder, tour of white tower, crown jewels, and several other things that escape my mind at the moment.Tips: You can avoid queues and purchase your tickets online at:http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/admissionsprices/toweroflondonadmission",Dont take a buggy!!!!
"June 18, 2012","Love it, lots of culture and history relating to the city I call home.  Absolutely fascinating but prepare for some queues into some of the exhibits - the worst thing we done was to take a baby (it was a last minute decision to go in) as she slept and we struggled - they did not think about buggy designs of the future when they were building all those little towers and winding staircases eh!",Finally ...
"June 9, 2012","After years of watching programmes and reading about it I finally got to visit it. Spent over 6 hours wandering round, visiting the different towers reading the history. Was impressed by the crown jewels collection. I can't wait to go back again.A must do with plenty and allow plenty of time.",Crown Jewels & Yeoman Warder Tour - excellent!
"June 9, 2012","The Tower is much more hands on than back in the Dark Ages when I was a kid - the Crown Jewels display is very informative as well as spectacular & the Yeoman Warder tour is even better than I remembered.  There were actors playing scenes from the Tower's history which was great (we saw Monmouth & co) & really brought history to life.Didn't see everything but can recommend the Fusiliers museum where you can (try &) pick up a full backpack of the kind soldier carry out in Afghanistan, try on different headgear & learn of their regimental history; & the White Tower with a fantastic display of armour & weapons.  Saw the Bloody Tower too, good but not as good as the rest...Advice: get there early & go straight to the Crown Jewels (if you want to see them) - there was hardly anyone today, THEN go on the Yeoman Warder tour, then wander around by yourselves.",Midieval times that comes alive..
"June 9, 2012","There is halal food just outside the Tower of London. It sells fish and chips, hotdog etc. The place is also nice. The beefeaters are doing a wonderful job in introducing the different places. There are the same number of ppl (befeaters) staying in the tower as there was few hundred yrs ago.",Beefeaters are a feast
"January 7, 2012",The Beefeaters are a feast everyone can enjoy - even vegetarians! They know their stuff and convey it well and wittily. The Crown Jevels are an absolute must and a triumph of both content and presentation.,Much more than expected
"January 7, 2012",Busy and expensive to get in but very historical.  Could easily spend a day there if interested in British history.  Would have preferred a tour option that gave less detail.,Real London History
"January 7, 2012","Take the tour, that way you don't miss anything.  I visited over 50 years ago and it still has the charm and magic it had for me as a child.  Well worth a visit","You can feel the history, it almost feels wrong to be wearing 'modern' clothing."
"January 7, 2012","Go early in the day because you'll likely want to spend an entire morning or afternoon there.Take a guided tour by one of the Beefeaters (just wait inside the gate with the crowd, they come every 15 minutes).  This will give you an overview and point out some of the more well-known areas (Traitor's Gate, The White Tower, Crown Jewels etc).Then take some time just to wander about.  Start at the White Tower (don't forget the souvenir shop in the basement).  There's armour, weaponry, a room decorated in the Tudor style, including the sounds and smells (yes, smells) of 'yore'.Most of the walls allow you to walk on top of them, giving you access to numerous rooms and cells as well.The Crown Jewels are also housed here and definitely worth a look.",Tower tours
"January 6, 2012","the best historic attraction we visited. Informative, interesting and slightly chilling! Fabulous :) ",Going back in time
"January 5, 2012","Briliant place to visit. It's an all day event. It's like going back in time. One sees  how the nobility lived compared to the solders, serfs and the like lived boct in the 1600's",Crown Jewels Dazzling
"January 5, 2012",While in London my niece and I went to the Tower of London for a visit.  We saw the Royal Crown Jewels  (lots & lots of them)!!!  Other fascinating features of the tower include the dungeon torture room of course - essential to any medieval castle life.  Another legendary thing we had heard about but needed to see for ourselves were the crows of the Tower of London.  They are huge!!  I have never seen birds like these and we made a video of them.  They are truly majestic.  The Tower of London is on the Thames riverbank and you have a very nice view of London Bridge and the river.  You will be very glad to see this World Heritage Site.  Don't miss it!,Back into history
"January 5, 2012",Any history buff will love to step back in time at The Tower of London.  The displays are always great and the Crown Jewels are worth a visit.  Much of the display at The Tower revolves around the ugly part of the violent history of England but it is part of the growth of humanity and should always be remembered.  We should all know about the past so we can appreciate the present. ,What a sight to behold
"January 5, 2012","History buffs, and those who just like interesting places, people and things, prepare to have a blast. Cant think of anything negative to say. Do were comfortable shoes, and be prepared to walk up hills and stairs.",just brilliant!!!!
"December 10, 2011",well worth the money to visit. we arrived in time to get a tour of the tower with one of the beef eater guides and he just brought all the tales to life i was mesmerised. the place is totally fantastic and a trip i will not forget. seeing the crown jewels was amazing and the ravens too. just brilliant!!!,A Great London Experience
"August 4, 2011","Throughly enjoyed our visit.  Be sure to allow yourself enough time to view everything, at least 4 hours.  We took a beefeater tour to start and them followed the audio guide throughout the site for the remainder of our time.  The line for the crown jewels was quite long on a Wednesday afternoon but it moved along quickly, so don't be put off.  The crown jewels and beefeater tour were the highlight of the visit.  We purchased our tickets in advance on their website and skipped a bit of queue time.",London's Premier Historical Site
"August 1, 2011","As an annual member of the Royal Palaces, I've been to the Tower of London three times in the past 12 months. Firstly, on a sidenote, I recommend visitors to get off at Monument tube station opposed to Tower Hill. The monument is a 300+ step column that was erected as a memorial in the wake of the Great Fire of London in 1666 and offers some great views of London.The Tower of London is a magnificent castle that is perched on the River Thames next to London Bridge. During my first visit I did the guided tour which I recommend for first-timers as it is conducted by one of the resident Beefeaters, is entertaining, informative and witty. I'm not usually a fan of guided tours but at this particular attraction I found the information relative and engaging. Within the grounds there are a number of different sectors to visit. The newly launched Beasts section is something of a disappointment even if the information is quite interesting (apparently Henry VIII kept a Polar Bear on the grounds!). The two highlights for me are the crown jewels along with a bloodline of heritage of the royals, videos of the various royal weddings and the jewels used at the royal ceremonies including the Queens crown etc. The second most fascinating part is the armory used by Henry VIII and other royalty that it remarkably well-kept and intricate in detail. There is a lot of showcase of weapons and armory with fantastic design. The grounds are also host to a war museum, the bloody tower, the site where Anne Boleyn was beheaded, the prisoners tower with preserved inscriptions dating back hundreds of years, the superstitious ravens (rumour has it that the tower will crumble if they ever leave) and other bits and bobs. All in all you could spend an entire day here and it would be well spent. One of the top attractions in London and offers so much.",Ensure that you have atleast 3-4 hours to really enjoy this...
"July 29, 2011",This is one of the must do's in london..... lots of history and stories are there about his place and the best place to heat them is to take the warden tour...Do make sure that you spare good 4 hours for this attraction as you would need to wait for 30-45 mins in the queue for the crown jewels and the warden tour is 1-1.25 hours long. You need to take time out to see the rest of the place yourself.Dont forget to get a glance of the Tower Bridge right next to the Tower of London....,Ceremony of the Keys
"July 25, 2011","A must do and it's FREE! Each night at the Tower they have a ceremony that is the traditional locking up of the Tower of London and has taken place on each and every night, without fail, for at least 700 years. It happens at 9:30 pm and they only let about 40 people take part each night. You have to write away for the tickets but they are free and it is a really interesting ceremony with lots of pomp and tradition, as you would expect! It's mice to be there without all the crowds of the daytime plus you are seeing something that really not that many people know about or have done. The address to get tickets is on this website http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/WhatsOn/ceremonyofthekeys.aspxand they recommend having 3 or 4 alternate dates that you can come.I highly recommend doing this if you can while you are in London. You won't be disappointed!",EXCELLENT DAY OUT
"July 15, 2011","We visited the site on Monday 11/07/11 arriving around 10.30am we had booked tickets via the internet which we collected from the information centre at Tower Hill so avoiding the queues which had already formed at the ticket offices. Entrance into the Tower took only a few minutes, the security staff searching bags at the entrance are obviously bored with their jobs and need an atitude change but the rest of the staff are helpful and readily supply information and help wherever possible.The Tower is full of interesting items and historical facts and its well worth following one of the outlined tours around the castle.Allow yourself a good few hours to see everything properly, but be aware as the days goes on the crowds get worse, so the earlier you start the better.Plenty of places to sit down and relax on a fine day.Great value for money if you enjoy history.If you want a good photo of the Ravens get your sandwiches out they will soon find you !",Don't miss out! The Tower is a must!
"July 5, 2011","My husband, myself and our three university aged children were on a once in a lifetime family holiday together from Australia. The Tower of London was a highlight of our visit to London! We all loved  soaking up the atmosphere. The ghosts of famous historical figures of the past such as Elizabeth 1, Anne Boleyn, William the Conqueror etc seemed almost to be standing amongst us! What amazing history!  We all loved our visit and want to come again!",Plan To Stay At Least Half A Day
"June 27, 2011",We originally budgeted only a couple of hours for this site but spent more than half a day here! The size of the tower is immense and the history is very well presented. You must take a beefeater tour! The cafe here is also very good. Their sausages are the best ones we had in England!,arrive early and beat the crowds
"June 21, 2011","I arrived at the Tower of London at 10am and had no wait to buy tickets or see the crown jewels, which were astounding. The armory display in the White Tower was interesting as well but the highlight was a tour by a Beefeater with a keen sense of humor. I had a great time and would recommend a visit when coming to London.",Where the medieval story books came alive!
"June 13, 2011","This place offered such an amazing look into the English medieval past. Our beefeater tour guide was very knowledgeable yet hilarious! Part of the time we were with the tour guide, the other part we explored the different towers on our own. The Tower of London is situated next to the famous London Tower Bridge so be sure to capture your photos from the Tower facing the Bridge! Each of the towers served a different purpose and I was most fascinated with the White Tower (main one) and not to mention the tower that houses the crown jewels of the past English rulers! We stayed in Russell Square and took the Tube all the way out to Tower Hill and it was an enjoyable (somewhat scenic) ride. This is a must in London!",Great way to spend a morning!
"June 13, 2011","We were able to take a Beefeater tour and visit the Tower of London complex in a few short hours, however if you are super interested in the armor displays you will want to give yourself some more time.  Loved the Beefeater tour, in fact our guide was the Raven Keeper as well!  He was great.  The Crown Jewels were awesome, however I was disappointed that there weren't any tiaras on display.  One tip! We purchased a Historic Royal Palaces Joint Membership which allowed us free access to Tower of London, Kensington Palace (which we ended up not visiting due to the awful reviews), Hampton Court Palace, among others.  This saved us money (or at minimum broke even), however it's worth the money even if only visiting 1 palace---we skipped all lines completely and walked right to the final ticket gates, showed the card, and walked right through. You also get a souvenir book and a 10% discount at gift shops.  Highly recommended to do this!",You need a whole day here
"January 18, 2020",This is our 3rd trip with the kids in the last few years and but each time we only spent 4 hours there. You need a full day.You can get caught up in the Dinosaur and Mammal exhibitions but these should be done at the start of the or the end of the day when it’s quieter.I still haven’t explored the Darwin section of the museum which is the most recently built section.The robotic T-Rex is not accessible at the moment and this is a good feature for the kids. The queues to get in can be be big midday but these take around 20 minutes usually.,"Great during school, awful during holidays"
"July 28, 2020","I love this museum and have been going here periodically since a child. It's a really fun day out however...Do not, under ANY circumstance go during school holidays. It goes from being 5 star to 1 star. It becomes horribly overcrowded and you will spend hours queuing, starting outside just to get in. You will not be able to move about freely and are just shuffling along inside a mass of people.This may actually be one thing that coronavirus improves.",Great Museum to wander.
"May 17, 2020","The Natural History Museum in London is a great place to visit, for any age. There are wonderful displays of huge skeletons of dinosaurs and huge sea life plus models of a number of extinct creatures like the Dodo. As well as the permanent displays in various galleries there are always special exhibitions and on our last visit, we loved seeing the display of wildlife photographers – great photographs. Entrance to the Museum itself if free but one may need to pay for entry to the individual exhibits. There is a very good on-site shop not only for souvenirs but great books, DVDs and other resource materials. There is an onsite café which, frankly, was a huge disappointment, you’d be best to eat out in our experience. You need to allow around two hours at least to sample the delights of the Museum, longer if you visit one of the exhibitions.",Outstanding wonderful museum 
"February 28, 2020","This stunning building is well worth a visit, with so much on offer to view there is something for everyone to enjoy!My favourite part was the 78 stone monkeys carved into the arches of the ceiling. The disabled access was brilliant through out, lifts to upper floors (3 floors in total) We came from Manchester and it’s nothing like we have currently in a way of a museum! My husband, 7 year old son and 9 month old daughter, so we had a buggy. went on a week day and it was still busy but we didn’t feel it was over crowded.It’s free to enter, (donation is asked) we bought the £5 child booklet they had on offer with everything to keep your kids entertained while exploring the museum! And we made a donation for the Map for a keep sake. The dinosaur exhibit is by far outstanding! It was brilliant!! It’s by far a MUST SEE!The public toilets were good and clean and baby change also had a private curtained room for breast feeding. The cafe was in a lovely room to the left for the entrance, the staff was brilliant and very helpful! The lady who served my husband and son was so lovely making them a hot chocolate with marshmallows and costs were reasonable. Plenty of seating and tables also.They also have large shops we went into the dinosaur souvenir shop and had fun looking at the items.And the large museum shop which we couldn’t resist picking up a few souvenirs for us and the kids. Again the staff were very friendly and we would defiantly plan a visit again!  ",The history of the planet 
"March 1, 2020",This i a must visit especially if you are visiting London not very often. You will probably need day to discover the hidden natural treasures of this museum but i would strongly recommend to spend a whole day for the first visit. In most areas its free of charge entrance. Highly recommend. ,Not Enjoyable
"January 31, 2020","Visited on Saturday 25th but this was not an enjoyable visit far too crowded and no control over queues,especially bad in the dinosaur rooms instead off allowing so many in at the time, half way through a worker was shouting for everyone to keep moving meaning you could not stop to view any thing, the amount of people made it very unsafe. Was glad to leave. Maybe they should think about a charge for entry.",New Years Day visit
"January 1, 2020","After visiting London numerous times we decided that we had to visit this museum on our recent trip & I’m glad we did.We got in early (not long after they opened at 10am) & I would advise you do this to miss the massive crowds that line up outside in the cold.There are many rooms to visit & the big ticket items (dinosaurs) are on the ground floor, but make sure you make your way upstairs to the other rooms/exhibits. This museum is free which makes it even better, especially when you are trying to escape the cold! ",Dated museum
"January 4, 2020",People often rave about this museum but it tends to leave me a little cold.  The displays are very dated and the layout of the museum leaves you feeling it is cluttered.  Disappointed that the Wildlife Photography exhibition was so expensive (and not free).  ,Interesting day out.
"January 1, 2020","It's rare to find something cheap to do in London with kids, how about free! It's free entrance to the museum however, some exhibitions may have a fee. Loads to see and do around the museum.  Plenty of eating places. You can take your own lunch and have it in the picnic area.",Natural History Museum winter fun
"January 6, 2020","We visited the Natural History Museum after seeing the Victoria & Albert Museum across the street. There was over 1+ hour wait to go ice skating at their rink located on the side of the building. Despite the wait, the crowds gathering were in a festive holiday mood and the atmosphere was great! After ice skating, we went inside the museum and saw the oceans and space collections, among other things. The addition of the ice skating rink made this museum worth visiting - not sure I'd return again any other time of the year.","Stunning, as expected"
"November 3, 2009","This place is amazing.  It is a true historic site worthy of a visit from everyone.  I've been there twice, but I think once would have been adequate.  It is worth a visit and is truly spectacular, but it doesn't change, so once would have been fine, too.",One of the best attractions in London.
"October 24, 2009",I have visited the Tower of London as a Man and a boy and the magic is still there. An educational trip through time.,Wonderfull
"October 23, 2009","This place was more than I expected, and I had high expectations when I arrived. I headed for the crown jewels exposition first, proving to be a smart thing to do to beat the crowds. The guided tours by the guards are highly recommended, but you don't need to start with one. The museum inside the Tower was fascinating -especially the part for children (however, fun for all ages) where you could try your skills as an archer  for example.",So much history
"October 23, 2009","One of our favorite places to visit when in London.There is so much to see and do in the tower.It can be a very long and tiring day though.Try to arrive close to opening time and make sure you visit the Crown Jewels first, as the waiting in line gets very  much longer later in the day. Also, its worth joining a Yeoman Warder  tour .They give a good ( and amusing) commentry on the history and take you into the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincular where Anne Boleyn,Katherine Howard and many other execution victims are buried.",Beefeaters are wonderful!
"October 9, 2009","Spent most of the day at the Tower of London.  Originally went to see the crown jewels but got a great surprise when we took two of the free tours with the resident Beefeaters.  On one tour they give you the history of the tower grounds, the royalty that has lived there, and the royalty that has died there.  On the tour of the white tower you hear of how the kings lived hundreds of years ago.   The guides were so much fun to listen to.  They truly love what they do and are enthusiatic about making thier guest enjoy thier visit.",History Come to Life
"September 13, 2009","If you only have enough time to do a couple of things in London, this should definitely be on your list.Buy your tickets online and then go to the ""group"" entrance. It didn't make sense to me at the time, but it worked out perfectly, and I got to skip massive queues that apparently started forming well before it even opened because when I arrived promptly at opening time there were already hundreds of people in line.Once you head inside the Tower, go straight to the building in the far corner that houses the Crown Jewels. This was my first stop and I essentially walked straight in, waiting less than 10 minutes. A few hours later I passed the line and was told it was a two hour wait to see the Crown Jewels. So go first even if it seems you are walking past other interesting things--you can backtrack to see them later.The towers with the prisoner's graffiti were fascinating, as were Traitor's Gate, the Palace, and the Bloody Tower complete with its exhibit on torture. And the relatively new monument to the beheaded victims was unique. Despite being very touristy, it was one of the places in London where you could really feel the historical significance of the place and in my opinion was well worth the entrance fee and time. Buy the guidebook and then take yourself around. I did that, and stopped on one of the many benches outside each tower or exhibit and read the paragraphs about it before I entered. I found that much more enjoyable than taking one of the fabled Beefeater Tours only because the one I started with quickly had over 200 people crowded around trying to hear the guide.A good visit here that covers everything will take three to four hours, and that is without counting the time you may have to wait to see the Jewels.",Spectacular and historic day out
"August 3, 2009","There really is a lot to see in the Tower - allow most of, if not a whole day for it.  Crown jewels and Henry VIII's armory very impressive, plus an amusing tournament/ sword fight for entertainment.  There is some queueing, but videos/ displays to pass the time.  Not really for the youngest of children, but 6 and above should enjoy it.  Not cheap at £17 per adult, but worth it.  Bargain if you use Tesco or other vouchers.",Get there early!
"July 28, 2009",I went to the Tower in the middle of July.  I read somewhere to get there early and see the Crown Jewels first.  This was great advice. I got there about 9:30 and went right to the jewels.  There was me and about 10other people.  A staff had said that I had gotten there before the insanity had started.  i left around noon and the place was really filling up by then.,Dissapointing
"July 22, 2009","Visiting the Tower of London I had high expectations, sadly I was left rather disappointed by the experience.Other than the exterior of the white tower, for me it lacks any feeling of real history. I was saddened to discover most of the surrounding towers were demolished and rebuilt in the 18th century. Walking around this historical attraction leaves you with a sense of being cheated as you only see a tiny amount of what is there, you are taken through many narrow passages, up steps then down again & so on with little to really look at on the way.The grounds of the tower are full of more recent buildings, its a total mish mash detracting from the historical white tower, some of the buildings even as recent as 1943? why ever was such a travesty allowed on such historical ground?The crown jewels were quite interesting especially queen victoria's crown. I also enjoyed looking at the display of Henry VIII's armoured clothing, although there was no information as to how this massive collection has survived?The most interesting part of the Tower of London for me, would have to be Traitors Gate. I would imagine its changed very little, although the steps from the water up to the bloody tower I have to say look relatively recent, as there appears to be no or very little wear to the steps.To see the best parts of the Tower of London observe from outside, you can get superb views of the white tower and also Traitors Gate without having to pay to go inside.I understood that no visit to London was complete without seeing this landmark, although I agree with this to an extent I feel the true identity of this landmark has been lost and if you want my opinion I would urge you to view from outside and leave the rest to your imagination.","Seriously, A Must See!"
"June 26, 2009","When in London, you must not miss this incredible site! Full of history, original architecture, and the Crown Jewels, a visit here can sum up what London once was. Said by some to be one of the most haunted locations in England, visitors can quickly see why ghosts might choose to haunt this venue. You must do the tour with the Yeoman Warders--their stories are rich and their dedication to the Tower obvious. You will learn a great deal and have fun in the process. This destination is great for all ages, but as the buildings are original and quite old, handicapped accessibility is limited. Allow plenty of time to wander through the many buildings-there is much to see, and you will be enthralled! No trip to England is complete without a visit here!",Absolutely Fabulous
"August 27, 2023","Absolutely  fabulous .. I went with my family and young Grandchildren. I had visited the Tower many many years ago and it really didn't disappoint.. We had an 11 am entry and thought we would have a long wait for the Crown Jewels, but we were so lucky and although we joined the queue we waited around 10 mins before getting in.We then went back to join the the next tour which is in my opinion is a 'must do' .. we had the amazing Andy Terry who was a wealth of information and held the audience with a mix of comedy too!Make sure you leave enough time to see it all 4-6 hours is what I would suggest.  It is quite costly with a large family but you can shop around for discounts, we used the 'lottery days out' vouchers through British Heritage.We are steeped in so much History and it is wonderful to see the Tourists in awe of what we are lucky to have here.","One of the ""must do"" activities in London -"
"August 26, 2023","Definitely take the free tour!  The Warders are knowledgable, and funny!  The Tower is a ""must do"" for anyone visiting London for the first time.  The line-up to see the Crown Jewels appears very long, but the new system they have - it moves quickly!  There is SO much to see, and after you have heard the info - everything makes much more sense & is more interesting. ",Must See When in London
"August 25, 2023",I consider the Tower of London a must-see. The main attraction is the Crown Jewels but the history of the palace and the tower is fascinating as well.,Crown Jewels Did Not Disappoint!
"August 14, 2023",I had always wanted to visit the Tower of London and was thrilled when I had an extra day to do so. My main objective was to see the Crown Jewels and I was not disappointed!  What a fabulous venue to be immersed in history.,Must See-Allow 3 hrs.+
"August 11, 2023","I last visited Tower of London in 1970. Vastly updated with enhanced visitor opportunities and greater access since then. The self-guided aspects are A+, extremely informative; begin with the Beefeater tour First,as orientation. Staff in period costumes stay in character so one feels immersed in the historic period. Do not stop your visit with a quick trip to the Crown Jewels! Take advantage of everything!Clean, safe, and fantastic in very way.",Highlight of our London visit!
"July 29, 2023","Our entire family found our tour of the Tower of London to be one of the highlights of our visit to the city this summer. So much incredible history.We booked our tickets in advance on-line and made sure to arrive on time for the Yeoman tour, which made all the difference. Our beefeater was very knowledgeable, funny and entertaining. The entire visit took more than 3 hours and frankly we could have stayed much longer, exploring the various chambers and taking in the spontaneous ""plays"" recreating past events.Don't visit London without visiting the Tower!",Interesting & Macabre Bit of History
"July 28, 2023","Purchasing and using the tickets through Tripadvisor went smoothly. They just scanned the code at the entrance. We went on a rainy Saturday morning around 9:30-10 and were concerned when we saw lines formed, but it turned out to be mostly tour groups so we walked right in with our tickets. The yeoman tour was very entertaining-highly recommended! We hit the crown jewels right after which was busy but we were still able to get up to the cases to see the exhibits, maybe waiting a minute for someone else to move on at each spot. A significant line formed at the jewels by the time we exited which was after 10am. The white tower, bloody tower, and torture tower were also interesting if not a bit macabre. My 12 and 15 year olds found the experience interesting enough and maybe even soaked in a bit of history! We spent a little over 2 hours but you could easily spend more if you do the audio tours and read all the plaques, which my kids did not have the patience/energy to do.","Amazing tour by Beefeater Mark, lines go faster than they look!"
"June 23, 2023","We had an awesome visit to the Tower, and it sure didn't hurt that it was a gorgeous summer day. Our Beefeater Tour was given by Mark who was clearly concerned about whether we would say nice things about him on TripAdvisor. He needn't have fretted; for a decorated military man, he nevertheless nearly missed his calling as a raconteur and comedian. Clearly a well-chosen Yeoman Warder and an absolute treat for us to lead off our visit.Since it was hot and sunny and our kids are young, we groaned a little when we saw the line for the Crown Jewels exhibit stretching all the way down the hill; we joined the line back by the Cafe entrance. Shortly after we got in line, it got moving quite fast. At one point we passed a sign stating 20 minutes from that point to the jewels, and it was barely ten minutes; by 20 minutes, we were well into the jewels exhibit. This was our experience throughout the visit; while it was indeed crowded, all of the lines moved quite well and we didn't wait a long time to visit any of the buildings or exhibits, use restrooms, purchase meals or snacks, etc. Also they don't actively manage the size of the tour groups; the Beefeaters somehow manage to do their thing with whatever size mob shows up and follows them around, and yet - it works.For us, there was so much to see and do at the Tower that we spent most of the day there. Glad we didn't buy a London Pass because it seems tor really get your money's worth out of it, you have to make it to 2-3 of the attractions each day. I definitely feel like we got a good value and then some with our Tower of London standalone tickets and would not have liked feeling rushed to get on to the next London Pass site.",Great way to get some English history.
"June 5, 2023","Such history in this little place.  Be sure to go on the Beefeater tour to get the big overview.  Very good story tellers.  After the overview, take a deeper dive into the White Castle and other interesting spots.  You can easily spend half a day here.  There really is no way to see the Royal Jewels unless you go first thing when the doors open.  By noon, the line to enter see the jewels is just too much.",Terrible experience
"June 1, 2023","There were so many people blocking everything, you can’t see any signs so I didn’t know pictures weren’t allowed. I took my phone out and got a five minute lecture about how i was told THOUSANDS of times about it. Not a single person told me on my way in. Sorry your colleagues don’t take your job as seriously as you, crazy lady! I wasn’t arguing and immediately put my phone away but she felt this offputting lecture was necessary. I get you hate your job and life, but don’t take it out on people who are here for the first time and don’t know every one of your royal rules. God forbid someone photograph your pillaged jewels, colonizers!! ",Favourite! 
"January 1, 2020",One of my favourite museums in London. This was my second visit and first time for my 6yr old. He loved looking around and enjoyed the interactive exhibits. Only negative was that it was really crowded when we visited so it took longer to get around. Would definitely recommend a visit here.,Not an amazing museum but something to do while in London I guess
"July 19, 2021","Honestly, I was expecting a little more from the National History Museum. There just didn't seem to be much to see and given the size of the building I was surprised. The animal and dinosaur section is probably the most interesting but given the size of the building I felt like there should be more to see, especially when a huge section of the museum was dedicated to rocks which I'm sure some people loved but it just seemed odd. I've been to other ""National"" museums and they've been a lot more interesting but luckily it was free so really can't be too angry about it. Stop by if you have a spare 2 hours but I wouldn't go out of your way to fit this in.","Beautiful setting, but far too crowded to enjoy it."
"August 13, 2022","The NHM is a beautiful building with so much amazing history. The entrance hall is simply breathtaking. It is also wonderful that there is no entry fee, so that everyone is able to visit the museum and it’s exhibits. However, this presents a problem…far too many people are being allowed entry to the museum. We pre-booked our tickets as we assumed that there would be a cap on how many visitors would be allowed into the museum at one time. This is could not be further from the truth and it was completely unnecessary as anyone can walk in at any time and we felt like sardines in a tin continuously throughout our visit. It feels like cattle being herded through the exhibits and it doesn’t leave any space for you to explore freely or read any of the information. We visited on a warm day, and the heat was stifling. Although this isn’t something that can be helped in such an old building, less bodies might be a good place to start. We had also pre-booked Dippy, again, a completely pointless exercise as everyone was just allowed to crowd into the room at the same time, and then you can barely see any of Dippy.The cafe is extortionate, £9 for a basic cheese & tomato sandwich, can of Diet Coke & some crisps is simply a rip off. Overall the visit was ok…but I don’t think we’ll be rushing back.","Dino Snores for kids , NOT worth the money"
"January 3, 2022","We visited Dino snores for kids event in decemeber.  We paid around £60 per peron including tickets but the activities done during dino snores were really disappointing. Event was crowded and chaotic.Gates open at 6.30pm but by the time we went in it was nearly 7.45pm, there were only 3 staff to check 100's of guests.Except T-shirt making other activities were not really interesting to kids who had been to these museums many times but were attending dinosnore for first time.You can do most of these activites during day time in the museum for free, sleeping experience wasn't nice.There were 4 activities in total, three in the night and one in the morning which you do on your own.1. Visiting Fantastic beasts portraits around the museum with an activity sheet.2. Making Dinosaur tshirt (you use a coloring pen to draw on a white T-shirt).3. Night trail, we expected more from this, you just go around the museum to find a name about a dinosaur and the instructor was bit boring , it was late, many kids fell asleep.3.  In morning, you will get another activity sheet which you do on your own.Sleeping-Sleeping experience wasn't great, they give you thin mats. There was social distancing here.  Breakfast was not great , one pastry and orange juice , there was no fruit inside our bag.I was intrigued as to why it is booked out but couldn't find any decent review , after reading this I hope you make your decision wisely.Overall it's not worth the money. DO IT during day time for free","Amazing as ever , with a new icon"
"August 21, 2022","I have been here several times , but this is the 1st time since they moved dippy out of the main hall , and brought in Hope the blue whale . Everybodies reaction to the impact of stepping into the main hall , is one of awe and amazement .  I didn't miss Dippy , especially as it is back for a limited time in a near by hall . I strongly advise pre booking for free for both Dippy and entry to the museum , as it is a long queue to get in ",Definitely worth a visit!
"February 23, 2020","We had a brilliant day at the natural history museum and couldn’t believe how great it is given that entry is free! The exhibits are interesting and varied and our children aged 6 and 4 really enjoyed it! Our children were blown away by seeing Andy’s clock and the staircase from CBeebies Andy’s Dinosaur Adventures! The dinosaur hall was naturally and as to be expected, very busy. It could do with being a bigger space so you can view and read the exhibits better without feeling rushed because you’re being pushed around by the crowd or getting in someone’s way. The route round the dinosaur hall is narrow in parts given the amount of people there so you just get pushed along by the flow! However don’t let this put you off, it’s definitely worth it! There is so much to see and do in the museum and the escalator to the volcanoes and earthquake hall is very exciting! There are plenty of cafes and restaurants spread out around the museum with lovely food and refreshments which is great as it means it’s easy to stop for food or drinks at several points during the visit and it spreads the rush for lunch around the museum rather than everyone trying to get food all in the same place. It’s an absolutely brilliant day out, we were super impressed, all enjoyed it and will definitely return next time we visit London.",Fantastic! 
"July 4, 2021",Last minute decision to visit as we arrived in London earlier than expected. So very glad we went. The whole museum is so well thought out and the descriptions and explanations of exhibits are all well done. Staff so helpful. Personally I thought the price of £16.10 per adult was excessive for the wildlife photography exhibition and so we didn't do it but I know the museum needs to make back huge sums of money lost during the pandemic. Liked the idea of the donation stands at the end and being contactless very practical. Recommend to anyone and everyone.,Day out
"April 13, 2022",Fantastic place to visit all of the exhibit areas are very good but if you want to see the dinosaurs- who doesn’t get there early queues were very very long and inside the exhibit it was rammed no control on how many could enter at a time bit like playing sardines. Although free entry you do have to book a time slot have to say way way to many people being allowed in today it does detract from the enjoyment when it’s as packed as it was today. Gift shops also very busy gifts not cheap but then it’s London and I have to say not as much choice as I expected. Managed to get seated in the cafe area but restaurant again packed.All staff were very polite and helpful. Definitely recommend as a fab day out if you don’t have children try term time when it’s maybe not so busy.,Some bits were excellent
"August 22, 2021","I’m a history teacher, so you would think that I would love this place. However, I found some of the displays a bit dated, especially where there was the stuffed mammals.  On the other hand, some parts of the museum were exceptional. Hintze Hall and the giant whale skeleton are a must see. We also loved the collections of gems, minerals and precious stones. We had pre-booked but they were accepting walk-ins too. I did feel that some areas were too crowded and it made it difficult to see some things. The T-Rex skull needs better lighting in the area that follows a timeline. The dinosaur exhibit area was very crowded and dark but it was amazing to see such a large collection.The museum is free but there is a suggested donation of £5, if you want to contribute. We didn’t pay for any of the special exhibits. Maps cost £1 and I really think you need one. There quite a few shops dotted around the museum. Toilets were a little harder to find, even with the map.",Dino Snores - Amazing experience
"January 12, 2022","A small group of us went to the NHM for an adult DinoSnores event - it was amazing and would recommend to others.The event starts around 6.30pm and you leave by 9.30am, during the event there is a 3 course meal, quizzes, talks, films, pop up bar and breakfast.Some of the exhibitions are open including the Dinosaurs and Wildlife Photographer of the year .For the whole event there are up to 300 people, which means that as you go around there is so much space to view things (only about 10 people in the Photography exhibition).A yoga mat is provided, you bring your own sleeping bag and get to sleep under Hope the Whale (although don't expect much sleep!)There were plenty of staff on duty to help find your way around (and serve drinks)A fabulous experience, one I feel quite privileged to have been able to attend.",Not what it used to be
"October 31, 2021","When I visited this museum as a child and then with our children the exhibits were accessible and could be clearly seen and understood.  How disappointing to find returning with grandchildren that  most of the museum is in almost in  total darkness and that exhibits are remote , often hanging from the ceiling rather than at eye level  and with  information boards  often too small and detailed  to be read at a distance.  The mobile  T-Rex mock up was really the only stimulating item for young children.  This museum, has become too crowded, too adult and only really suitable for students, I do not recommend  a visit if you are accompanied by children as it  does not   have  a suitable level of prestation for  them.Too much razzmatazz and not enough thought for  the simple needs of young children. ",Needs air conditioning and better cafe
"June 11, 2021","The dinosaur part is particularly good as is the Earthquake/Volcano area.The rest is pretty much as I remember it as a kid which is fine.It was ridiculously hot in there. Didn’t appear they have air con or if they do it certainly wasn’t working. Pretty uncomfortable walking around in the heat, especially when we are required to wear masks (which I’m not against)The restaurant is a disgrace. The sandwiches were dry - barely buttered - and overpriced, the coffee although made barista style certainly didn’t taste it plus no Coke Zero? What place doesn’t sell the 3 Coke flavours? Far, far too expensive and the range of food very limited.",Always a great day out.
"September 23, 2021",Visited to particularly see the Amazing Beasts exhibition as my kids are big Harry Potter fans.   Really well presented and held their interest for ages.  The museum itself is always great and recommend just to get ahead of the queues and access to the Anning Rooms.,Photography exhibition
"January 2, 2020","Fantastic. I really think everyone should visit this exhibition. It’s really beautiful and really important. Go early as it gets a bit busy in there and there’s not enough room between the photographs so you need a quiet spot to see and read everything. It’s really brilliant though and worth the jostle. The photographers are amazing, and I’m always blown away by the finalists. So good.",Birthday - Day trip
"September 18, 2020","Architecture of the building is amazing,  we were both really looking forward to the visit,  prebooked timed ticket entry, staff very friendly and helpful, hand sanitiser points frequently positioned.Downside which resulted in us leaving earlier than we had planned,  too many mums with pre school children who seem to use it as a crèche,  some displays were very crowded as staff were just letting people in without checking space, and there was no social distancing in places.  Felt unsafe in the dinosaur and whale sections,  staff should have ensured appropriate numbers entered. Children running everywhere and too young to have or maintain any interest in the displays.  Such a shame as love this museum but won’t be back anytime soon!",A good day out but pre-book!
"October 28, 2023","We brought the children here during the summer holidays, so it was naturally very busy, with all the usual tourist traffic in addition to families.  Firstly, I need to point out that you cannot just walk up and go inside (which is how I remembered it). After fighting our way through London traffic and people, we were shocked to find two lines to enter the museum; people who had ""pre-booked"" and people who hadn't. So even though you don't need to actually pay to enter, you will want to pre-book a timeslot to avoid having to queue outside, for over an hour, in the pouring rain, just to get in.... What made it worse, was that when we finally made it to the end of the queue, we were seemingly just waved through without any checks at all.To top it off, once we entered the building, we were met by a sinister looking gauntlet of card machines that we needed to run in order to actually make it into the entrance lobby. With the huge number of machines creating a bottleneck of people trying to get in, it felt like we were almost climbing over the machines just to get past. It was flanked by several members of staff who were also encouraging us to donate. I get they need income, but after queueing outside for an hour just to get in, it felt a bit dirty.This was my first time here since the removal of Dippy. I remembered it being a place packed with wonder and all manner of historical artifacts and on that score it did not disappoint. Needless to say, it was extremely busy, so expect the usual at these types of events; queues to use the toilet, people pushing and shoving, long queues to order food and then no tables to sit at. For us it was an exhausting day.We did pay for an extra set of photos with the children with the dinosaurs in the back ground (green screen type setup). It cost us £20 for a full set of three physical photos, keyring and fridge magnet, as well as digital access to all photos. We considered this pretty good value.So overall, it is an excellent source of information and education about the natural history of our world, for adults and kids alike. Definitely plan to spend the entire day here as it's a large museum and you will likely spend the day packed into the middle of a large herd very slowly moving through the museum.",Trip
"April 7, 2023","Went in the morning we got there earlier than anticipated but we were still allowed in before hand so that was good. There was a big line for those who didn’t already book so definitely make sure to book before hand. It’s super close to the underground station so that’s handy and there’s a lot of museums close together so you can’t really get bored. There’s somewhere that will take your bags and coats if you pay, however it does cost £ so if you won’t want to pay make sure your bag is light. In some areas it does get packed but overall because of the size it isn’t too bad. The food is really good for the price and was very quick considering how busy it was. Found it really nice that there was people who worked there going through some extra information and even had fossils we were able to hold. If you want to do it all in one day you definitely need to be there for opening as there just so much to see. They have a really nice gift shop that has Jurassic Park merchandise which were all reasonably priced. The toilets were cleaned. There is plenty of space for wheelchairs when going around as well that was good.",Spectacular tour of the NHM!
"January 5, 2020","My daughter and I did a Private Guided Tour of the Natural History Museum. We really enjoyed the morning with our tour guide Craig. He showed us many of the museum's treasures and explained in detail why they were relevant. The crowds were massive that day (December 28), especially in the dinosaur area, so we greatly appreciated Craig guiding us from exhibit to exhibit. The museum is so beautiful and I look forward to seeing it again. I highly recommend this tour and Craig!",Wear Comfortable Shoes!
"November 1, 2021","Had a great couple of hours here & really enjoyed seeing the dinosaurs & mammals - everything was so cleverly presented & all seemed so real!The building itself is absolutely beautiful, inside & out - by far the prettiest of all the museums in London.Make sure you wear comfortable shoes as the building is huge & there are are lots of steps to negotiate! There were lots of people there when we visited, but then it was half term week. I was charged £3 just to hang up my coat in the cloakroom, so that was my donation as I thought that was an excessive charge.",Beautiful building
"January 7, 2020","The best thing about it is the building itself.. An absolutely stunning piece of architecture. There is a surprising number of things to do as well as just look at stuffed animals, insects and dinosaur bones. There is a large interactive display about human senses which is very interesting and great for kids of all ages. A museum like this really should get 5 stars but I've knocked 1 off as it gets so busy.. I walked past it on January 3 and there was a 1 hour wait to get in. The day I went was not so bad but even so it was rammed. Try and go during term time, lots of schools do trips there but it is still quieter than the holidays.",Please charge an admission!
"January 6, 2020","It would seem that most parents here think this is some kind of crèche, letting their children run riot. Just because it is a free space, shouldn’t mean you can let your kids run around shouting. I could only bare to spend an hour hear. Every time I went to read a info board, I couldn’t concentrate due to some of the children around me. I think a small charge, would at least eradicate this problem and if parents were actually paying for something, they might feel their kids should actually be looking at the exhibits. Rant over.",My Favourite Museum
"June 13, 2021","I love this place. I hadn't been for years so when we visited London with some friends we kept one morning free to revisit. It was an absolute joy. The staff are great, every room of this massive museum is stuffed full of great exhibits and superbly presented information and it's free to get in. Amazing. My best experience of 2021 so far. I cannot wait to come back soon.",A Must to Visit!
"March 19, 2020","From the beautiful renovations to the outside of the building to the carefully laid out exhibits the museum makes for a great day out. While we were there there were a number of school parties on a day trip to the museum. They were just mesmerised by the scope of the natural world. Cannot do it justice in one day, there is just too much to see so be selective about where you visit. It has the added advantage that it is free.l",very good and educational
"January 5, 2020",It's free to visit but a donation should be made to help with running costs. So much to see you could spend a full day in there.Big que to get In but well worth the wait in my opinion,Amazing place for children and family!
"November 8, 2022","Simply stunning architecture sets the stage for one of the best museums in the world.I was very pleased to see that Dippy was back in pride of place and I enjoyed the exhibit on earthquakes and volcanoes.I recommend you, it is better to go in the morning when it opens or else there will be many children in the dinosaur exhibition.A great day. 👍🏻",Was in awe of the beauty and magnificence of this museum.
"January 19, 2020","A visit I’ve wanted to make for many years, and was not disappointed. Got to the museum mid morning on a Saturday and walked straight in, but was busy with families excited to see the dinosaurs. Loads to see and very informative and fascinating. Spent several hours wandering around, when we came out about 1.30-2 there was a long queue to enter, stressful if you’ve children, so get in early.",Quite disappointing really
"November 25, 2021","I don't really know what I was expecting, having not been to the NHM since I was a child, but the experience left me somewhat underwhelmed. Yes it's free, I get that, but the experience wasn't what I expected. We are a family of 4 of us (2 adults, 2 kids aged 6 and 9). One of the main issues was just how busy it was. It was absolutely heaving, to the point where I felt uncomfortable, espcecially with the potential to catch coronavirus as so many people weren't wearing masks. This together with the fact it was so hot inside (due to only having fans and no air con), made it a very uncomfortable experience. We were all glad to exit to get some fresh air by the end. One of the issues I have is that despite booking a time slot, it was very obvious that they let anyone in at any time and didn't even look at the booked time. This is why it is so busy. Absolutely pointless booking a time slot! The exhibits were OK, although the map was a bit confusing and didn't explain what was where in each room, so we ended up going up and down the stairs frequently to find specific things.  ",Festive ice skating visit
"November 15, 2021","Have visited the museum a number to times over the years but this was the first time we'd been for ice skating. We'd booked online so had a slot, all very organised, a little bit of queuing but moved quickly. It was pretty busy but it was 5pm on a Saturday so to be expected. I looks beautiful as night falls with the building lit, fairy lights everywhere and a Christmas tree in the centre of the rink. The ice was in good conditions, the little ones can hire the penguins (£6 extra charge). Plenty of staff on the ice to help. There's a carousel, stalls with sweets and a cafe for hot drinks etc. You get 50 mins skating time which is plenty. It's worth a visit as I think this will be the last year the NHM will have a rink.",Visit it for sure!
"January 7, 2020",I visited the museum with my two kids and adore it. The exhibitions inside are amazing especially the dinosaur and zoo area. The blue whale skeleton is amazing and also like that they have a lot of dinosaur skeleton hanging from ceiling. Visit it especially with kids they have a lot to learn. The entrance is free and that's why the museum is too crown from the very morning but if you' re patience you gonna see everything. There is also a shop in the museum and another one close to dinosaur section especially for kids who love dinos!,Average. Not as good during COVID
"August 23, 2020","We came on a flying visit to London and have never managed to brave the queues, so COVID advanced bookings seemed like a great time to book.Booking was free, easy and we arrived in advance as requested to hardly any queues. I couldn't fault the accessibility of hygiene and hand sanitizer.A lot of the exhibits which were interactive were closed, and to ensure social distancing, any exhibits which can't offer a one-way system were also closed off, which included some of the aerial dinosaur walks which get you closer to the skeletons. This was a shame.It was enjoyable, but we hsipped through really quickly and didn't really pause for long at the exhibits. We live in Cardiff and we're surprised that the National Museum there had better exhibits.Good for a quick visit, hard to fault when it's free, but not as engaging as we had hoped and an hour and. A half was plenty for a wonder round. Wouldn't want to come here during COVID with young children who are not of reading age.Good for: a quick visit, adultsBad for: kids, kids who like interactivity, dinosaur fans. ",Overall amazing!
"December 3, 2021","Overall a really amazing experience. Spent 4 hours here! Definitely takes longer than you think and we didn’t even get to see all of it.The food in the Kitchen area was okay. While I was able to have some chicken, cabbage and wedges in the end, staff had very poor knowledge of catering for gluten free and there were very slim pickings. The food itself was ok - chicken was quite dry but not bad at all for £12.Unfortunately huge parts of the exhibits were missing sometimes, each room had multiple areas with signs about the exhibits being removed or under renovation. And in areas the lighting / interactive parts didn’t work or were out of order. However that didn’t sour our experience much at all and we had an amazing overall experience.","It Was Good, That"
"August 8, 2021","I very much enjoyed this trip to the Natural History Museum with my three pals. We hadn't booked tickets, but arrived at 10am to queue for about 10 minutes and then were released into the exhibits (we were overjoyed to find it was completely free!). First stop, the bogs. These were located at various points throughout the venue, which was a huge relief seeing as I was travelling with someone with a slightly weaker bladder. We then went to the Human Evolution section, which was really interesting. There were so many real-life skeletons and reconstructions of our distant relatives. We then went up to the Volcano and Earthquake section - best part was probably the earthquake simulator. We also enjoyed seeing the huge whale in the main hall and learning some more about the planets of our solar system. Another highlight was the gift shop as it provided lots of giggles.My biggest disappointment was the dinosaur section as I found it quite boring (apart from the big T Rex). Good for all the family, free and lots to see and do, which brings this museum's score to a 4 out of 5 on this occasion.",Magnificent building!!
"January 16, 2020","The Natural history museum is not only for children or nature scholars. The amazing building is worth the visit by itself, and remember that the entrance is free!Don't miss the blue whale skeleton in the main hall of the old building, the dinosaurs section, the huge moon replica, the red zone with the earthquake simulator, or the treasures in the top floor, with the moon stone or the first edition of Charles Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"".You can stay an entire day here, depending if you have kids interested in these subjects, or if you are an aficionado yourself.Enjoy!","In a word, 'WOW!'"
"February 17, 2020","Having visited the Natural History Museum in Oxford, this was a long-awaited visit for me, personally.The museum is enflesslely brilliant and interesting. As a FREE site, it is up there with the top things is recommend to visit.The Volancoes and Earthquakes section is truly fantastically executed with an earthquake simulator near the end of this area. We had an excellent level of dialogue between myself and my friend's nephew!The blue whale skeleton is absolutely breath-taking and really dominates any visit in a pleasent way.The dinosaur section is really well done, as well.This needs to be on the top of everyone's agenda when visiting London!",A hugh collection.
"March 17, 2020","In my travels I have come across nothing that compares to the Natural History Museum as a museum of the Natural World. The building is impresive in itself and is seen at it's best entering by the main entance hall where a real Blue Whale skeleton hangs from the ceiling. The mammals hall nearby contains a full size model of a blue whale among it's many excellent exhibits.Other good sections include Human Evolution, and a section for Fish Amphibians and Reptiles and Mammals.Down one of the corridors runs an impressive collection of Ichthyosaur and Plesiosaur (extinct reptile) fossils.And there are there are the dinosaurs. These include motorised moving models of dinosaurs. There is also some fossil skeletons of dinosaurs, this best of which in my opinion is Sophie the stegosaurus. What I think gives Sophie such class  is not her size, she probably was not full grown in death, but the fact the skeleton overwhelmingly comes from one fossil unlike most dinosaur skeletons which seems to be mostly made plaster replacing what is not found in the ground. Oddly Sophie is held away from the main Natural History Collection in the Geology Museum part of the collection.A good feature of the museum is that you are not obliged to pay an amount for visiting you pay what you think the visit was whorth. Which is useful if you do not have time to to have say a £20 whorth of visit.",I just  had to see Titanosaur .......
"October 28, 2023",".....the main purpose of my visit. A £16 exhibition fee but I had pre-booked a timed visit the night before and just strolled in, a short queue into the exhibit at midday but the museum seemed fairly quiet for a Saturday. The exhibit opened a fair few months ago so now you can queue up and pay to see this amazing exhibit. Since the pandemic pre-booking and timed visits seem the orderly way to go almost everywhere and takes the chance factor of getting in somewhere away, there's pro's and con's to that but I made it in and WOW.There are a few information screens to pass before getting to see Titanosaur but when you do it is an amazing moment, similar to when I first saw ' Dippy ' on School visit many years ago.Titanosaur is massive and amazingly 3 or 4 times the size of ' Dippy '. What made this visit unique was that you can actually touch the skeleton of this 100+million year old dinosaur. putting the palm of my hand on one of the thigh bones of Titanosaur was a magic, almost spiritual moment. We've all seen those DO NOT TOUCH signs but here you can. I had a bit of a wonder elsewhere on the ground floor, the ' Hintze ' hall is always a special place but Titanosaur stole the show today.",Interesting but far too busy. Needs restricted entry. 
"August 13, 2023","I hope the NHM takes on some of these reviews as constructive criticism.I love the NHM and I value highly that the UK provides free entry to museums. However, I do think the time has come for the NHM (and possibly V&A and British Museum) to started a ticketed entry system in order to reduce the number of visitors per day. It was far too busy. Not only the queue outside but once inside it was damn near impossible to see anything and explain things to the kids. People just see it as a tick list of places to visit and just crowd to take photos of things without even reading anything. Plus the heat in there!I feel the place needs a refresh. The dinosaur section has proved what can be achieved. If a section was closed to change exhibits and signage many would welcome it.  Doesn't need to be drastic, the plesiosaur wall will always be impressive, but the hyena and Panda look like they are 200yrs old. By all means continue to show taxidermy as it is historically interesting but a better comparison of new science would be welcome. The kids found it interesting. Aided by our knowledge of natural history more than the signs but they tired quickly due to the crowds and the heat. Only saw two sections before giving up as it was overwhelming for everyone. Sort out the crowds and this place will stay a gem. Currently the museums are turning into places to avoid. ",Uncomfortable
"April 17, 2022","We went in the Easter holidays on a Saturday. 2 adults, 3 children and 2 babies in a double stroller. We booked in advance The best experience we had there was the picnic area downstairs which we used as soon as we arrived as it was lunch time. We started out tour at the bugs and walked round ok was a bit crowded, we then got in the line to see the dinosaurs, it was a bit of a slow moving queue but we got in and I wish I never did! We had no time to look at anything as we had NO choice but to keep moving around and follow the path around I had 5 people step over my daughters legs in the stroller to get past even tho I was walking as fast as the flow let me! My children hated it and wanted to leave, they were getting pushed past by grown adults to see a trex they can see from behind them. I didn't blame them wanting to leave and we felt uncomfortable as them, so after an 1hr in the actual museum we left. But the picnic area was lovely 😅 dinosaur theme tables, highchairs there's toilets and baby changing down there definitely recommend taking your own food.",Sadly poor and exhausting!
"February 22, 2022","Very sad to be writing this but a family visit today was terrible!Staff were great but the crowds were horrific, the queues were unbelievable and while visit was stressful and exhausting.Queued for 30mins to get in for our booked time slot just to have non-ticket holders walk straight past and get in before us.Queued for 30mins or more to see the dinosaurs, just to be packed in like sardines, having to shuffle around with hundreds of others.The museum is fine but please explain to me what the point is of having a limited number or time slots to then just let anyone and everyone in.",Need a whole day to explore
"July 26, 2020","A remarkable museum. The displays were great with good signage and explanation provided. We tried exploring the whole museum but couldn't manage it in half a day. The main part which houses most of the displays were very busy while over in the Orange Zone which hosted the wildlife garden, spirit building, and Darwin centre was much quieter. Do pay attention to the building itself as sculptures of different plants and animals can be found everywhere from the columns to the ceiling. To top it all off, entry is free of charge. Will definitely return for a revisit if we're back in London.",Perfect Activity.
"September 9, 2021","Wow! What a day out! This place is amazing for couples, friends and families and there is so much to see and do. Lots of natural history and different monuments to study, look at and enjoy. Everything is examined in short brief points that don’t over complicate things. Everywhere was clean, tidy and the museum was just stunning! As a FREE place to visit in London that will cost you nothing more than a tube ticket, £1 map and a cup of coffee, this museum is definitely worth exploring. The Blue Whale skeleton in the main hall is just spectacular to look at. Take your time, take it all in and enjoy. It wasn’t too busy and crowds were controlled too. We will return as they are always adding to the museum.",Fatntastic Beasts Superb - Rest not so much
"July 5, 2021","We came to see the Fantastic Beasts exhibition and it was absolutely amazing, so well done in the way that they wove the Harry Potter films with the natural world. The room setting was lit atmospherically and the range of displays was varied and captivating.Really worth a visit, we also managed to see some of the dinosaur exhibits while we were here.That's the positives..now for the negatives:The amount of people walking around either without masks or with them around their chins was absolutely astounding, even though it's still mandatory inside buildings etc.No clear signage to get to the exhibition.Weren't able to use the cafeteria earlier than our tickets, no real loss in the end as we ate elsewhere and I'm pretty certain the food we had would have been better than at the museum.",Fun free morning 
"August 21, 2021","Spent a morning here with 2 teens who are very interested in natural history. Currently they are asking people to book ticketed time slots, which are free. All these were booked up for the weekend we were in London, but we heard they have a limited number of walk in spaces each day so arrived just before opening, joined a short queue and quickly gained admission. Some really interesting exhibitions within a lovely old building. We spent a good couple of hours looking round. A number of the hands on activities however were rather dated and several were in need of repair. We used one of the museum cafes for lunch and did find this rather overpriced.",Get there early in peak season fantastic day out & free!
"August 13, 2022",As you walk up to the building it’s just amazing and as you walk in your immediately hit with history and the exhibitions. A fantastic day out for all with so much to see. It gets very busy in the holidays as you’d think it would but take your time as you’ll miss some beautiful exhibits. The cafe is extremely expensive though and not worth the money (sorry NHM) £3 for a small juice is just wrong! so definitely take your own drinks/food if you’re not willing to spend a fortune on refreshments,"Interesting Visit, but very busy"
"January 14, 2023","Amazing museum, a great range of interesting & details exhibits and items on display, with some truly amazing items. Too much for one day so have done over multiple trips, doing a 'zone' each time. Museum is extremely busy, recommend booking an entry slot to avoid waiting, but inside it is very crowed & noisy in places making it difficult to see the exhibits. Museum is clean & well maintained, good facilities & helpful staff.",excellent
"December 21, 2022","What a fantastic museum - the collection is amazing, the layout engaging and the building is very well kept. The museum is free but I booked online to avoid queuing as I wanted to see Dippy before it went on tour again. Enjoyed seeing the T-rex with his Xmas jumper and Santa hatplan ahead for holiday seasons as the museum does get quite busy",kids and adults will love this place
"November 30, 2021","if you are with kids, defintely a place you want to bring them to. The centre piece is the blue whale which i took many photos with it. you need to pre booked the free ticket and only pay if you wish to visit the special exhibition.I do like their different collection of their gem stones, dinosaurs. really enjoyed my visit there.",Perfect for family 
"March 17, 2020",I took my daughter here a few times now. So much to see and much time is needed however one thing I will say is over the years the dinosaur exhibition keeps getting smaller which is upsetting as its the best part of the museum. I remember days where I used to walk around for ages seeing all the wonders of the dinosaur world. But unfortunately it's been reduce to a mear information point. It's upsetting but regardless the whole museum as a whole is amazing. Highly recommend a visit. ,Creepy crawlers and Lon leggety beasties
"January 9, 2020","We all know there are bones, insects, animals and ruddy great dinosaur in this museum, so I can’t shed any light on what you should see - that’s entirely your choice. What I would say is take time to savour the stunning architecture beginning with the external of the building. The elaborate brickwork, colour and massive scale is truly beautiful. Oh but when you get inside, just take a minute, draw breath and look up and the great hall. Salute Charles Darwin and enjoy the tour.",A must do.
"January 5, 2020","One of the best indoor experiences London has to offer, you could easily spend a whole afternoon here. The architecture of the building is mind blowing and the exhibitions a different and interactive, good attraction for kids. Very impressive, best thing about it is that it's free to enter. Donations welcome! ",Lots to see but super busy!
"August 6, 2023","We pre-booked our entry tickets well in advance and it proved to be worth it as not only did we jump the massive queue that was outside (in the pouring rain) but they were also turning people away who hadn't pre-booked by the time we got there so don't waste your trip - pre-book!As soon as you step inside, you are faced with the impressive Hintze Hall. This is definitely one of the highlights of the NHM, so take it in! You are then sent through a path of 'voluntary donation' screens where you can donate to the museum if you are so inclined. We didn't make a donation but it didn't matter as we spent enough elsewhere to more than make a 'donation'!Maps are available from the support desk at a cost of £1 each. If you don't want to pay this cost, print one off at home from the website before you come!We had come to the museum straight from the Underground and so made a beeline for one of the NHM's cafes for refreshment. It was incredibly busy, seats were at a premium (we had to 'borrow' seats from other tables as people left), it was remarkably hot despite an industrial fan blowing from one corner of the room and food choice was limited and quite pricey - a cheese and tomato sandwich was £4.50!After eating our expensive snack (and being grateful for not donating on entry), my husband wanted to fill his water bottle at one of the refill points dotted around the museum but found it to be not working so had to wait for the next one we arrived at. Not ideal really given the warmth of the place and amount of people wanting to drink water to refresh.The museum is vast. There is a LOT of walking and area to cover. We spent the best part of 2 and a half hours here and did not see it all. We targeted what we wanted to see which included the Blue Whale, the T-Rex, the Giant Sequoia, the Giant Sloth and The Vault.We did visit one of the other on-site cafes, The Coffee House, thinking that may be a little quieter being over the back of the museum but that turned out to be just as full and busy as the other one! We had a drink and left.We ended our visit with a trip to the museum shop which really does have everything you could possibly want from virtually every area of the museum! You will easily spend about 45 minutes in here unless you know exactly what you want to buy so make sure you leave enough browsing time! The NHM is a great place to visit but I would have liked more air conditioning and less people as it did appear to be oversubscribed in numbers of people able to be inside at one time, which shouldn't really be the case with having timed tickets? A shame as it really is a wonderful place to see.",A True History
"August 5, 2023","In July 2023,  i made a £7 donation to the Natural History museum. I will never forget that,  i went there to visit with my Grammer school from Manchester in the 1980s. The reason i made the donation and will continue to make donations is because its very educational rocks, Dinosours etc. I love the Natural History Museum, after all i was born on 4th July American independence day when George 3rd lost independence to the Americans. I therefore have Provinance to George 3rd and my surname Sharief means in Arabic Noble. I went to Paris to pay my respects to Princess Diana where the statue of liberty was built and given as a gift to the Americans. Thank you.",Great day out
"August 5, 2023",Great to have pre booked tickets as the queue to people that had not was massive. Better off wearing shorts in there as it was so hot.,Natural History day out
"August 4, 2023",Everything is so dark and dated. Not enough seating in museum.Cafe seating very limited scramble for chairs.Only one WC near  cafe. Long queues.Very hot.Animated T_Rex brill as well as the two small furry ones.You must book a time on line it’s free and you jump the long queues to enter. However even though it’s free with a voluntary request for a donation inside you are met with a gang of staff pressuring you to cough up. Quite intimidating and put me off making a donation.The exhibits need brightening up and rethinking.Glass boxes after boxes of thigh bones is totally boring for children.,Too busy! Couldn't enjoy it. Pre-booked tickets worked well for us.
"August 1, 2023","I visited with my 12 year old son. It was sooo busy! You couldn't move freely around exhibits, which made it difficult to view and very hot. The weather was wet outside, so I dread to think how it would be on a hot day. They had fans on but it wasn't enough. If the museum restricted visitors a little it would be a wonderful place to visit. We ended up leaving not long after getting there.We pre-booked our tickets which worked well - we walked straight in.",SuperB day out in London
"August 1, 2023",Great day I the city. Really magical collection of nature there. Lovely family day out. Must to see in London when come over.,Overcrowded and warm
"August 1, 2023","Came here in early-July 2023 ahead of the summer peak and school holiday season. Nice exhibits categorised by a number of colour zones. The main issue was overcrowding, heat and humidity; it felt like rush hour on the London Underground throughout much of our visit. The crowds got progressively worse during the day and we left by late-morning. Although we booked timed arrival tickets in advance, these were not checked upon entry to the museum which may explain the overcrowding inside the museum. Due to the volume of visitors, it was impossible to actually spend time reading some of the exhibit descriptions which was a shame. ",wide range of exhibits
"July 31, 2023",The museum is fantastic with a wide range of exhibits. You'll need about 3-4 hours to see everything. It's essential to book your tickets online and select your visit day and time to avoid long queues.,Good
"July 29, 2023","Everything was fine except the rude lady at the entrance, the staff inside was nice though loved the dinosaurs and shops",Loved it
"July 28, 2023",We were in London for another attraction and added the museum on as an extra. The museum quickly became the highlight of our visit. Very welcoming staff and friendly interaction with our children. Well informed displays and a great under the ocean family show. Clean toilets ,JUST DON'T GO HERE!!!!!!!!
"August 3, 2021","My wife and I visited last week as the country was starting to come out of lockdown,we had secured tickets and booked weeks before so we thought that the museum would be quiet as they were only allowing in bookingsHow wrong was I ,it was jam packed, we went to see the dinosuar exhibition which was narrow and in a  one way system,there was so many people in this small area ,banging into us,trying to get past us and the flow of people was such that if you slowed down to read or look at the exhibit someone would walk into you . Most people I believe ,like us were attempting to get out of this rat race and were jostling and bulldozing their way through.We never saw anything in this exhibition and decided it was far too busy.Had there been no pandemic and social distancing I would still been intimidated and bullied into leaving.I would suggest limiting the amount of people entering this section, we are patient enough to wait or perhaps be directed to something less busy ( I can not tell you if such a section exsists here as we immediately left)The nearest subway station was closed and we spent longer walking from the nearest open station to the museum than we did inside it.we spent longer waiting in the queue outside the museum than we did inside it.(did all these people have a booking at the same time as us ??)I would not recommend this ""attraction""",Worth a visit if you’ve not been before
"February 2, 2022","Well worth a visit if you’ve not been before. I visited 6 years ago then again more recently, not much has changed in that time. My other half spent hours in the mineral room looking and cabinets full of rocks, I lost interest about halfway through. I suffer from osteoarthritis in my knees and struggled with stairs, also I noticed a shortage of benches and places to rest. The Dinosaur exhibit is always very poplar but it’s hard to look at anything for long because you end being swept away by the throngs of visitors. This area was very narrow in places and claustrophobic. The restaurant offers lunch boxes and hot drinks, it’s really expensive for what it is (maybe be acceptable in London but came as shock to me).",Fantastic
"September 23, 2021","I have visited this museum before and I am very impressed with its management and organisation.  This is a fantastic place to visit and with free admission it has got to be one of London’s most impressive attractions.  Its architecture is exceptionally beautiful.  The interactive learning experiences for children are very accessible but much is to be learnt from all of the display areas.  Facilities are excellent and the restaurant and cafes offer good value for money, cater for food intolerances and offer a healthy range of food.  I shall definitely return again and again.",Great time
"May 8, 2020","I have been to museums all around the world and yes, of course, this is by far one of the best museums in the world. It is also one of the most comprehensive museums I have been to. This is a must see. We went there 3 days in a row just because we kept getting there late during the day and wanted to see everything b/c it was so niceThere is just too many people",A MUST SEE for adults and children alike
"April 18, 2022","The most outstanding natural history museum to see. We didnt event get to any of the paid temporary exhibitions and we spend hours (and could have spend many more) at  the museum. Vast and interactive, with an exciting dinosaur section and a huge minerals and stones section.Do come early as there are queues and despite the free entrance, do consider donating to the museum which is crucial to its sustainability. ",Impressive building with the wow enrance hall
"October 9, 2020","The building itself is worth a visit, purpose built and with lots of fascinating details like the climbing monkeys around the columns. Signs explain why the tatty, faded exhibits have not been replaced due to the delicate balance of preservation and curiosity.  However some are so bad they really should be removed even if not replaced. The dinosaurs are impressive, and without the high numbers being allowed in it is easy to walk around and read the information available. And it’s FREE, amazing, the online booking was simple and we walked straight in at our allocated time .","Fantastic day, here from 10am-3pm"
"November 4, 2021","Visited during October half term with my son, I had Booked tickets for 10am and when we got there the queue was SO LONG but thankfully because we had already booked we where directed to a shorter line around the side. Tickets scanned, quick bag check and we where in. Boy what an amazing place, we spent hours here looking at everything. Stopped in the cafe mid day for a quick drink. Then carried on exploring the museum. My son was in awe at hope and the earthquake simulator. Early afternoon we took a break to visit the gardens where my son did the trail that was on looking for clues attached to trees, I took a break and sat on the bench and just took in the fresh air and quiet away from the hustle and bustle (I have anxiety and crowds often get the better of me, please note my son is 12 and was within the gardens with me at ALL times, he also had his phone on him) the trail wasn’t long but was just what he needed to burn of some pent up energy and to enjoy some fresh air and safe open spaceBack into the museum where the queue for the dinosaurs was finally shorter so we got into the queue and visited the dinos which are amazing. Then up to see the birds and the giant sequoia and then we left at around 3.30 after a visit to the gift shop and another crushed penny for my sons collection.",A Good Welcome Back to Museums
"August 18, 2020","To be frank I rarely write reviews of anything in London since I live here and keep my reviews for my travels, However, in this peculiar year my travels are restricted to London so it seems reasonable to write reviews. I regularly visit the NHM for special exhibitions but here was an opportunity to visit the permanent galleries now finally reopened. You cannot do it all in one go so we visited the birds, the earth galleries upstairs and (of course) the dinosaurs. Book on-line. Enter on-time. Straightforward. Not a place for a specific route except amongst the dinosaurs. Busy there and with lots of children. Lots of hand sanitizer. Cafe open.",So so
"May 22, 2022","Visited with 2 children age 6 and 9. Kids liked the exhibits they saw, but it was really far too busy for any of us to see much at all and it really took away from the magic of the experience of visiting this iconic museum. We had booked timed entry tickets in advance, but no one was paying much attention at all to tickets as we went in and many of the areas were far too busy. Kids were looking forward to seeing the dinosaur area but were really disappointed by the conveyer belt feel to it that prevented them stopping to look as they went through. Less popular areas needed some TLC and the volcanoes and earthquakes section was so hot it felt like you were at a volcanoe. Fabulous that you the museum is accessible to all and free but i think that there are better museums in London that are all free to visit and handle visitor flow much better. We went to visit the british museum the next day and both children commented that they enjoyed it much more than the natural history museum due to it being less crowded. We won't be planning on visiting the natural history museum again.",Great exhibits but bring your own sanitiser!
"August 29, 2021","The museum itself is lovely; the building is magnificent and the displays are some of the best I’ve seen. It’s easy to spend a whole day in here. However, visiting during COVID wasn’t as enjoyable as it has been in the past. I’m not sure the museum itself is responsible for all of this, but I do think more could have been done to make the museum feel safer. This was one of the few places we visited in London where most people weren’t wearing masks, and it was busy. At times, it felt uncomfortable. Most of the sanitiser stations were empty, meaning people weren’t sanitising as much as they should. Lots of children were running wild and seemed unsupervised, which was a shame. I’d still visit here again as I love the museum and the exhibits, but I hope they do more to encourage COVID-safe behaviour.","A fun, educational and interesting place to visit"
"June 11, 2022","Such a great day out, the fact this place is free entry baffles me, I’d recommend donating if you can to keep places like this open for all to enjoy.Obviously it was extremely busy, but not to the point where it was uncomfortable to move. It was well managed.The place has something for everyone. It has really detailed information for people who it interests if you look for it, but also lots of fun activities and exhibits to interest the younger audience.The cafe was a little expensive but let’s not forget you are in the middle of London.The place was overall extremely clean and filled with friendly staff to guide you and answer any questions you may have.I definitely recommend a visit and also to take your time and learn something new.",So glad it was raining
"February 26, 2020","Hadn't intended to visit but as the weather was so wet, like a lot of people, we needed inside entertainment. So glad we opted for the NHM. Spent a few hours wandering around a beautiful interesting and informative museum. Well laid out into sections so you can miss out bits or double back and do some bits twice. Our granddaughter was fascinated but not overwhelmed as able to take on board all the info. It was half term so very busy but they did stagger entry so didn't feel too crowded. Cafes served lovely food and cakes. Shop was huge and reasonably priced and some great little souvenirs for kids. All in all a great few hours. ","Great day out for all the family, rain or shine. Expect it to be busy & pre book book tickets"
"February 28, 2023","I came here on Saturday, alone, to explore the museum. It is such a great collective of scientific work catering to all ages - it really is great for children and adults alike & explores a range of different topics (ie: animals, dinosaurs, earthquakes, human body, solar system) to cater to all interests. My only disappointments with my visit was that I hadn’t realised there was the wildlife photographer of the year exhibition taking place which was prebookable and so I could not enter as hadn’t bought the ticket. Something I will definitely check and attend in future. I would offer four pieces of advice.1. Book online ahead of your visit. It is still a free ticket when purchased online (with an option donation option) but you’re guaranteed a speedy entrance and bypass the crowds to enter. The queues were massive when I arrived but I walked straight in. 2. Expect it to be very busy. This museum is great and well known, it’s also linked to Sir David Attenborough. It’s a great activity for all the family and kills a good few hours, rain or shine. Therefore it’s always going to busy. Expect that and give yourself plenty of time.3. Do not expect everyone to be courteous. I found this quite frustrating during my visit, but many times people would just walk in front of plaques/signs you’re reading, stand in front of you, push in front of queues, and aren’t polite. I actually saw a group of teenage girls push past a group of people giving way to an elderly man with mobility issues and a walking stick on some stairs to the point where he was almost knocked over. It’s very frustrating but if you’re prepared for it, hopefully it won’t spoil your day.  4. And finally, expect to rack up lots of steps exploring all the exhibits so wear comfortable shoes!",Huge museum; book in advance
"March 27, 2023","There is so much to see in the Natural History Museum! We spent several hours there and only saw a fraction of the exhibits. It was a Saturday morning and there were a lot of families as well as visitors from all over the world but there is room for everyone to see something they will like. We found the fossilised sea creatures particularly fascinating, perhaps because we did not previously know much about them.The displays are well presented and explanations are clear and easy to read. One tip we were given and would like to share: book tickets online in advance. Entry as free if you book in advance or at the entrance to the museum but if you reserve beforehand you will not have to queue up to get in, and the queues can be very long.","Loved it, whale’s pretty cool"
"October 1, 2020",The museum was pretty awesome. However my friends hyped up that there was a big T. rex when it’s actually now a blue whale skeleton- still very cool. However not quite reliving night at the museum to it’s full extent ,Natural History Museum  
"February 12, 2020",Nestled across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum is another marvellous piece of architecture dating back to our ancestors. The Natural History Museum is a wonderful place to take children. As you walk through the skyscraper doors into the entrance way it is a feast for the photographic lens and if your lucky a display of a dinosaur or something that is magical and unbelievable will meet you upon your arrival. I Highly recommend this place when visiting London. Give yourself at least a minimum of 5 hours to visit if not a whole day. Oh and get there early before the crowds ,"Illustration, education amid grandeur"
"January 19, 2020","My wife and I along with my daughter's family with four kids visited this place on a dank, rainy Sunday.  Although busy, this cavernous facility swallows any crowd.  Many, many of the displays are simply stunning.  The architecture of the building is as well.  Kudos to the curators for imparting such a wide variety of knowledge to children and adults alike.",Wild life photographer of the year
"January 5, 2020","As always an excellent portfolio of photographs from around the world. Especially stunning underwater photographs. Terrific pictures of penguins. Some of the photographers went to great personal hardship to achieve excellent images, putting up with extreme conditions in freezing temperatures for days on end to achieve their objective - a stunningly different take on animal behaviour.",Go online and book in advance
"October 4, 2022","The museum has a lot to offer for both adults and kids of all ages. There's a fair share of reading in English involved, so be prepared for that if you're with kids. There's typically a longish queue in front of the building, but if you have made your reservation online - you just walk right past it and show it to the people at the enterance.",Visit the T-Rex
"January 4, 2020","This place is phenomenal. You can see galleries of all kinds of taxidermy animals and insects. They have amazing exhibits on minerals and metals as well. But the dinosaur exhibits are my kids' absolute favorite, especially the animatronic t-rex that roars and stamps it's feet. Such an amazing exhibit and worth the crowds to enjoy.",Overcrowded and warm

"June 1, 2022","Booked tickets in advance yet they weren’t checked upon entry instead we had a member of staff shouting about making donations to the museum. Popular dinosaur exhibit is now a mess with top half now closed and everyone forced through the ground floor section (which had parts closed off). Too many people, no control whatsoever. A couple of areas in the exhibit saw some large and potentially concerning bottlenecks with no where to exit. The museum’s other standard exhibits were very busy as per school holidays but, generally, it felt like there was no control from the museum and it was a free for all. A lot of the exhibits are great and interesting but I remember seeing them in years past.Left disappointed, felt like the glory days of the museum are very much in the past.",Definitely worth a visit! Top tip- prebook FREE timed entry tickets a couple of days before.
"December 30, 2022","The building is absolutely stunning, absolutely 100% worth a visit for that alone! We booked free timed entry tickets  a week before going, which is good because they were turning people without tickets away on the day, as its was at full capacity, so I'd advise going online and getting free admission timed entry tickets. The collections inside were all great, and although it was extremely busy in there, we managed to see all the exhibitions with no trouble. We had initially thought it would just take a couple of hours, but honestly could spend half a day in there easily (with 11 and 13 year olds). We grabbed some sandwiches and coffees from one of the cafes, which were nice enough, there were also areas to eat picnics if you bring your own food. If you go to London, it's definitely worth a visit.",Stunning building. So much to look at
"June 3, 2022","Hard to believe that places such as this are free to visit. How lucky we are. Can easily spend 3hrs plus in here, looking at various different exhibitions and artefacts. The ice skating in the winter is great too...although obviously not free. Easy to get to. Spacious","World class museum, brilliant for ALL ages"
"January 30, 2023","There are so many great museums in London, including the next door outstanding V&A Museum, and I'd recommend this for all ages.  Highly recommend spending a little bit of time in the South Kensington area as there are quite a few good restuarants nearby, and Knightsbridge / Harrods is just up the road, plus Hyde Park is a stones throw.  Loads of kids events, so worth checking their website.",Astonishment view
"June 2, 2020","The paintings, the animal replicas and last but not least the design of the skeletons is amazing. You simply walk through rooms with huge ceilings and marvel at everything you can see around you. This museum is an oasis of happiness for the soul, which gives free rein to your imagination.",Mixed emotions - could be better
"February 24, 2022","We pre-booked a time slot and managed to enter the gardens a bit earlier. Very very busy, staff managing entry in 15 minute time slots. Once inside it’s not so clear what is where, signage could be a bit clearer at the entrance. The dinosaur area was very popular so much so that you couldn’t read many of the displays.  Other exhibits were good, a massive display of stones and minerals, but no real wow factor anywhere. Queue management inside was poor, with an and exit route crossing the entry queue. Outside you had to go against the incoming visitors, bottleneck at the entry point. Could be better organised!",Overcrowded and uninspirational
"January 15, 2023","I have been fortunate to visit many museums in many countries over the years on many different subjects but unfortunately  this is the worst experience ever. I booked tickets in advance and arrived at the correct time.  There were literally hoards of visitors going through the doors at the same time and the main hall was just a mass of visitors wandering around aimlessly.  There were so many families with buggy’s making it more difficult to walk around.   The signage was dreadful showing blue zone, green zone etc but with no details as to what you would find there!  Unless you had a map or managed to find someone to ask you were clueless.  The exhibits were tired and the explanations next to them looked like they had never been updated.  The lighting surrounding the exhibits were awful.There were just too many visitors and I feel that after going through the pandemic and security in general this was not overly a safe environment to be in.This museum would be more suited for organised trips run by schools, colleges and societies.",Very busy
"September 11, 2022","We visited in august during the warm weather. You can book online and is significantly easier to book online before attending. It’s free, so makes sense. The museeum is absolutely massive, to do the whole thing will easily take most of the day, we haven’t anticipated how large it was! The dinosaur section was the main thing we wanted to see, so focused our trip on that section. The museem was incredibly busy and make it really difficult to move round, if anything they were letting through too many people, you couldn’t really read an exhibit or do any of the activities within the exhibit because someone else was either breathing down your next or pushing you put the way. We left after maybe 2 hours, it was so hot in their, to the point it was unbearable. I would love to visit again but not when it’s warm and not when it’s so busy.",Lots to see. Take a picnic. 
"August 14, 2021","There is so much to see here. Something to capture everyone’s interest and well worth a visit. The tickets are free. People were packed in so tightly that seeing things properly was made impossible. Our 9 year old lost interest quickly after getting fed up of having to fight through crowds at every turn. That was a real shame, as it meant he chose to cut our visit short and we didn’t see everything he had planned to see.  We are going to try a term time weekend in the winter instead. The restaurant was closed, so we visited the cafe. They only serve sandwiches, slices of tray bake cake and crisps - so the choice is poor.  The manager was there and seemed to be the most miserable person we came across all week bless her. ",My favourite 
"January 1, 2020","This place is my favourite museum in London. I visit this place each time I visit london. Love their exhibits of extinct animals, fossils, dinosaurs, birds, mammals, marine lives etc. There are Sections for planetary system, geology, volcanoes etc. All in all I love this place. I would say for anyone with kids over the age of 7-8 years will enjoy this place. Kids will enjoy the exhibits of animals, the skeletons of whale, dinosaurs etc. There is a life size T. rex which is moves and makes noises. Kids love this. Very educational place for both adults and kids. I would always recommend this place. ","Must do the Treasures Museum , many miss this !!"
"September 15, 2021","I have been here many times here and can’t believe I haven’t been up the stairs at the back of the great hall to visit “The Treasures” which are the Museums greatest collections. Such as the first ever recovered fossil in the world that led to the discovery of the Dinosaurs and a Penguin egg that was one of three to survive being brought back by Captains Scott’s mission in the Antarctic. There is also a QR code that you can go to , to get an audio guide for more information on each exhibit. Just phenomenal.",Even better than expected
"January 19, 2020","We were very excited to visit the Natural History Museum of London. First of all, the building itself is gorgeous and a piece of art. The inside is also stunning, especially that blue whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling. We were very impressed with the exhibitions - the mammals, the dinosaurs, the different birds, the stones and other minerals. There are so many things to see, we spent about 2 hours there.",Like Ikea with rocks in.
"April 18, 2023","This place is like a massive ikea but with rocks in it.  The queue to get in was ridiculously long but I had pre booked so that was ok, pleased I didn’t have to stand in the queue.  Inside was just so crowded and hard to navigate and see all the exhibits.  The way finding signage inside was terrible as trying to find the toilets was a challenge in itself.  In the end I just got too hot and irritated by the crowds that we had to leave. Sad to see that the special exhibit that is in the news had to be booked and paid for to be able to see, it was fully booked the day we went.  Will not return.",Lovely museum
"July 7, 2021","Pre booked our tickets (which I think they should keep by the way!) and walked right in. No one checked our bags even though the people in front of us were being checked. Managed to look at all the exhibits which we enjoyed. Even though social distancing was there (signs on the floors and walls etc) barely anyone was adhering to it. We had brought sandwiches with us and went to the dining hall to eat them and it was closed! Both the website and the map said it was open so was a bit put out having to eat outside. Good job it was dry and not too bad as there was only 3 benches. Glad we came, my child had a great time and that’s what matters",Great place (avoid hot days)
"July 26, 2022","Amazing museum, but take our advice and avoid visiting on a hot day in summer during the holidays. Just so stuffy and overcrowded. Booked a time slot but no one seemed bothered about that and the dinosaur section becomes overwhelmingly crowded.",A great place to see history
"February 12, 2020",My kids love going to the museum and seeing actual remains of historic creatures.  As they are homeschooled we see this as an educational experience for them and have become members.  This provides discounts and access to the peaceful Anning rooms when you need a break.,Cool visit
"February 15, 2020","We visited Natural History Museum on 14.2.2020. I must say that average time spent there is 2,5h. Well we stayed for 4 and still skipped some places. I am so happy we went. Time well spent! In cafe behind Hintze Hall were delicious desserts and in shop in geology section you can get various types of stones as tiger's eye, amethyst etc.",The Photo Exbition was a special experience
"March 10, 2020","Our visit to the Natural History Museum was concentrated on the nature photos exhibition. The pictures of different creatures was fascinating, wether marine life, mamals, environment, small and large creatures. One could envisage the pacience in which the photographers approached their subjects resulting in an extraordinary good quality.",Terrible dinosaur exhibition
"April 8, 2022","Parts of the museum are great - the section on earthquakes is really good, and the mammals and creepy crawlie rooms are really well done. But the dinosaur exhibition is awful. The fossils, models, and info are great but it's crammed into what feels like a tiny space with very narrow walkways. Staff make it clear that they don't want you hanging around to actually read any of the information about what it is you're straining to see through the darkness, and it's so unpleasantly claustrophobic that you don't really want to hang around anyway. Honestly, it's so terribly done for what should be the NHM's crown jewel, and what 90% its visitors will be visiting to see. Huge skeletons tower above the walkway but it's so tightly packed in that there's no chance of appreciating it, and the T Rex skull is stuck up on some shelf in the ceiling. Really can't get over quite how badly the exhibit has been put together. Our autistic child had no chance, completely inaccessible to him and the environment was overwhelming in a bad way. NHM should be able to do better than this",Dinosaurs and Treasures Gallery
"March 3, 2020",Museum provides a sense of scale as to how big dinosaurs were as well the blue whale.  Treasurer galley has Darwin’s first edition book and about another dozen various historical items. All free and friendly guides that can answer your questions,Fantastic museum but needs some organisation!
"September 19, 2021",Visited the Natural History Museum as it’s a place I’ve always wanted to explore and my last visit was very brief. I booked the ticket a month in advance.The museum exhibits and building are superb! Probably the finest building and museum collection in the world. The main negatives we’re how crowded it was. It wasn’t pleasant! I thought booking tickets in advance was because there was limited numbers allowed in but it was packed. I planned to stay all day but after 3 hours I’d had enough!,Needs a bit of an update
"August 25, 2023","We paid the extra to see Titanosaur, and it was fair for what it was.We love the building and how even it is all centred around the natural history. Parts of the exhibitions are looking tired and could do with a bit of an update-they were the same 10 years ago when we were there-thankfully the children were much younger so didn't remember them too much.Our favourite bit was and always is the mammals section, they do need some tlc though.The TRex restaurant was good, the pizzas were farily reasonable, although the scant bowl of chips was slightly over priced for what we got.The biggest issue I had with it was the overcrowding. There were just too many people in the building, I understand it is a free day out and the more people you admit, the more chance someone will donate and it really doesn't cost much more to open for 1 person or 1000 people, but maybe charging a small fee might be better and then control the numbers admitted.",Photography Exhibit 
"March 14, 2022",Went to see the Wildlife Photography Exhbition. I usually love this exhibition but to be honest this time it didn't blow me away. It seemed like a much smaller exhibition without much to see. Not worth nearly £20. The Natural History Museum was heaving at 10am on a Sunday morning but well organised. ,Very Crowded And A Little Disappointing
"September 3, 2022","The museum is easy to get to from the South Kensington tube station, but it is quite a long walk from the station exit.  You book tickets (free) online for a timed entry however I don't see the point of this as there was no control of people entering and it was massively over crowded, which really spoiled the experience.I was a little disappointed to learn that the larger exhibits are recreations from the remains discovered. Perhaps I should have known that but, for me, it spoiled it a bit.  The main dinosaurs are definitely impressive but once I'd seen those, I was pretty much done inside 30 minutes.  Did I mention that the flow of visitors was very poorly managed, resulting in massive overcrowding?  That really spoiled my visit.",Exciting but crowded
"January 11, 2020","There was a q to get in and it moved rather slowly. This was despite the fact we had reached the museum half an hour before opening time. The exhibits were interesting especially the dinos.  However, the layout for the dinosaurs exhibits was not smart especially for such a popular exhibit. The crowds were forced to go through a maze like corridor and it was really crammed and disorderly. You could not enjoy the exhibits because you were forced to move with the crowd. It was much too narrow and rather claustrophobic.  Need to find a good time to re visit.","Great museum, but obviously busy"
"August 18, 2023","I went with 7 friends between school and uni. The exhibitions were very good, but it’s a busy place, as you’d expect. One of our group was autistic it was useful to know that they provide ear defenders and sensory packs, with a booklet showing the quiet rooms around the museum. The dinosaur exhibit was great, but the one-way path through was difficult as there were many less interested tourists and children who didn’t want to read everything! The marine invertebrates room was fantastic, and I enjoyed the pliosaurs and plesiosaurs on display in the marine reptiles corridor. We also paid for the titanosaurs exhibit and really enjoyed the immersive elements, and I think this was the highlight of my day. The picnic area was quiet at around 11:30, which was a useful place for a break, and the booklet on quiet rooms in the sensory pack was helpful. We used the contemplation room. Staff were mostly helpful, although some were less patient when the autistic person was struggling to communicate. Generally, an enjoyable day and given it’s London, the business is expected",Pretty good - get there early
"February 4, 2023","The architecture is beautiful, worth seeing just for that.  The dinosaur area was good, but very dark, needed more light.  Good displays and map directions were good.  Get in early though, it can get very crowded and noisy, difficult to get around.  ",Not happy !!!!
"September 16, 2023","We visited yesterday 15th sept with my daughter and granddaughters who were over from Australia. Had we had just walked around the museum I’d have given more stars but I’m pretty annoyed that we paid almost £60 to visit the Titanosaur exhibit after being told how amazing it was by a staff member, what a total waste of money !!!  I’m stunned that the museum can charge so much money for this, it’s mostly screens with poorly animated dinosaurs some of which didn’t work and 1 dinosaur skeleton totally shameful, my granddaughters said “this is rubbish” !!!! out the mouth of babes.. please do not fall for this very expensive mistake just enjoy the rest of the museum and save your money ",Great indoor  activity option for London
"January 23, 2020","This building is amazing in and of itself-- so beautiful. This is a HUGE museum, and the displays are wonderful. There is a great variety and something for everyone. We had a rainy afternoon and ducked in here for a respite, and glad we did. There are also plenty of small  cafe's throughout the museum for chances to grab a bite or a drink. Perfect for families!",Awe-Inspiring Visit to a Grand Museum
"April 23, 2020","Amazing fossils, skeletons and preserved animals on display in the setting of a grand British building. Many extinct animals on display there including the Dodo bird, dinosaurs and several giant sea creatures. Admired the gigantic  skeleton of a Blue Whale that is suspended from the ceiling in the Hintze Hall. Highly recommended! Definitely something out of ""Night at the Museum""","Disappointing, hot and far too busy"
"August 21, 2022","Some amazing exhibits but sadly you don't really get to see them as you shuffle around as part of the long hot packed queue of people. Incredibly hot to the point of feeling sick, the number of people there very much ruins the experience. Not what it used to be due to too many people and a begging notice for donations every step of your visit. I was prepared to make a donation but was put off from doing so as I felt pressured into it rather than it being a choice. I would rather they charged an entrance fee and got rid of the begging - is just too much",24 years and still one of my favourite places.
"August 15, 2021",Simply nothing too much to be said. I've been coming here all my life and it never fails to fascinate me. Sometimes I go alone just to take in the pure awe of all their exhibits. I would recommend coming here to anyone (entry is free!). It's a lovely way to spend your day and the food is reasonably priced and very decent for museum food!,The place to visit in London
"August 12, 2021","Doesn't matter what age you are, you'll love it here. It's a surreal experience seeing dinosaurs skeletons tower over you, asteroids and star dust in glass cabinets dating billions of years ago and extinct wildlife exhibits. There's  information plaques dotted around so you can take a leisurely stroll at your own pace with seats dotted around.There is a cafe but its very busy, you will also need tickets in advance (free). ","Interesting and interactive museum, extremely hot inside on hot days, drink lots!! "
"August 4, 2022","We went here for the first time as a family. There is lots to see and do. Really interesting interactive aspects. We all enjoyed the dinosaurs and whales areas. The downsides were how hot it was, esp in some rooms.  Clearly August is a hot month but with the understandable crowds and the heat we didn't stay as long as we would have liked. Getting there as doors open is a top tip. We will come back another time as we did enjoy it. ",Great visit! Strongly recommend visiting!
"August 6, 2023","My family and I recently visited the Natural History Museum whilst enjoying 2 days in London. This was the highlight of our trip, especially to see the Titanosaur exhibition.Some of the reviews of this FREE museum are very far fetched. This is a great visit with your family in London and you could spend hours here!I agree with most reviews that you should pre-book your tickets to skip the queue. There were staff on entry requesting a donation but in no way did I nor my family feel under any pressure to donate.It was the summer holidays when we visited, so we naturally expected it to be busy and it was. If you want a quieter experience I recommend not visiting during summer. Despite the amount of people, I was able to take photos without other people in front, and never felt like a sardine (similar to rush hour on the Tube)There are a wide range of animals, dinosaurs and other fossils to enjoy at the museum and the gift shop is extensive! All the staff are friendly and helpful.  Did I mention this museum is FREE?I would definately recommend visiting the Natural History Museum when you are in London.","Stay overnight at the natural history museum, Dinosnores!"
"August 7, 2022","Having been gifted the Dinosnores evening, I was slightly apprehensive as to how this would play out but we were pleasantly surprised! This is is so worth doing if you have you get children, it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity to sleep in the great Hintze Hall under the blue whale and explore the dinosaurs by torchlight. It’s slightly chaotic but in an organised chaos kinda way. Once the lights go out at bedtime, it’s silent! Probably because kids (and adults) alike have been worn out by the activities and excitement of being in the museum after hours. I would recommend the following…we expected it to be cold (being an old museum and huge spacious hall)…it was anything but. Prepare to be warm, maybe stick a pair of shorts and a t shirt in to change into come sleep time. Even for when walking about it’s pretty toasty. But I can’t vouch for how this would be come colder months. Take a good snack…when snack time comes, we took crackers, biscuits, sachets of hot choc…being that the snack was scheduled for 8.30-9pm but being active and busy inside the museum throws you out and my young son was starving, bedtime snacks could’ve easily been a sandwich or small picnic! And drinks…there are water filling stations but if you need a juice or Diet Coke, bring it for snack time for a boost. Don’t overpack, we were more than well equipped with a sleeping bag each, snack, reusable water bottles and inflatable pillows. If you can, do it, it’s absolutely the unique experience you’ll want to do before the kids grow up!",Excellent and informative attraction
"January 10, 2020","The Natural History Museum was located close to transport links and easy to get to and from using the underground. The museum is large, spacious and informative. The items on display are interesting and would return to visit again. ",Great museum. Lovely staff
"October 27, 2021","Where else would you see huge dinosaur skeletons, travel into the centre of the earth, experience an earthquake and come face to face with glittering priceless gems. And all for free too! The staff here on a busy day were exceptionally kind and enthusiastic. They made the visit even better. It’s a great place and we’re so lucky to have free museums like this.Top tip. Have a breather half way through your visit, There are loads of eateries and cafes nearby without the queue inside including Pizza Express. You can go back again then without any hassle and you’ll feel more refreshed for part 2!",Kids Everywhere
"May 30, 2022","We only had about an hour to get through here and since my husband is a huge dinosaur fan we made that a priority. Guess who else looks loves dinosaurs? Kids of course! Luckily he's a big man so he walks in front of me and basically moves everyone, including kids, out of the way. The exhibit was informative but it was sad that all the skeleton displays were at least 6 feet in the air or completely surrounded by glass so as to keep people from touching/climbing on to them. Wish this wasn't the case but everything that wasn't protected was being touched/climbed on. I think that they would do really well with an ""adults only day"" every once in a while. ",over rated
"April 11, 2023",crowded .with long lines. limited displays of things readily available in other museums. best things cost extra,Too crowded. Wouldn’t let non-members in.
"April 10, 2023",Walked an hour in the rain from Lambeth only to be told it was too crowded to take non-members. It probably sucked anyway.,Great museum with loads to experience
"April 9, 2023","Loads to see, and clearly laid out and labelled.  Dinosaurs, mammals, sea creatures, insects etc.  Very informative.  We really liked the earthquake simulation and also the house of insects.  Free entry, but we were then harangued as we entered by a member of staff who shouted at us that the museum was a charity and we should make a donation via the card readers.  It was a bit over the top and not the greatest welcome.  Maybe better to ask people to give on the way out after an enjoyable visit?","Two hours waiting to get in, really!"
"April 8, 2023","Not sure why we queued for two hours because it’s free? My daughter needed loo after An hour and half and went right in?It seemed unnecessary and when we got in needed loo and restaurant immediately which ruined whole experience,Staff members need to inform visitors without tickets that museum is free and allow people in, doesn’t seem right to keep visitors especially children and disabled people like myself waiting to get into a museum that is free!",Well worth a visit
"April 8, 2023","Please do visit, it was a great experience, we stayed for 5 hours!Some of the exhebitions are a bit dull, relaying on plaster replicas of animals, where as others are great, especially the display of birds. A bit sad that the garden is not open at this time, as it is being remodelled, and I would have liked a gallery on plants, maybe there were some that we just missed. ",Excellent but avoid the T-Rex Cafe
"April 8, 2023","One tip, book beforehand so you can enter through the fast track queue otherwise you’re in for a long wait.  We also booked for the dinosaur exhibition which was awe inspiring.  Worth a visit.  It’s all very well organised.  I’d avoid the T-Rex cafe. Lots of staff but complete chaos.  We had to keep asking for food/items which they kept forgetting. Seriously don’t bother. Go to the other one.",Not as good as expected 
"April 7, 2023",Went during the Easter school holidays with my children and it was rather disappointing. Thankfully we had booked tickets as without the queue to go in would have been endless.I was expecting it to be busy being the school holidays but this was just too much. We lasted about 1 hr 30 mins before getting too hot and a bit fed up having just really been swept around in crowds unable to see things fully or take in any information. Unfortunately I am limited to school holidays so would not be returning as I would not advise visiting during these times. ,It's been ages and ages.........So glad to return.
"April 7, 2023","The last time I was here 'Dippy' was on the meet and greet which was some years ago. 'Dippy' has been replaced by 'Hope' the Blue Whale in the the great 'Hintze Hall'. It's a magnificent room with a seated statue of Charles Darwin keeping watch up the first set of stairs. If you get to choose which way you enter the museum choose the front, I took a side entrance in but had to make my way to the Hall before I felt I was really here. It's the heart of the museum and for me one of the most amazing rooms there is, anywhere.'Hope' takes centre stage in the main hall but is suspended from the ceiling so whilst she is amazing in her own right and maybe bigger than 'Dippy' she lacks the eye level, massive dinosaur, impact that 'Dippy' used to have.  'Hope' however is the real deal.If dinosaurs are your thing the there is a separate room for them and a few other dinosaur skeletons doted around the museum. The main dinosaur room is dimly lit and is hugely popular so can get cramped.An animatronics' T-rex is one of the first big dinosaurs you see, but there are other better and real ones to see. T-Rex looks like he shares the same dentist with Jurgen Klopp, the Hollywood teeth on a dinosaur just looks wrong, at least he wasn't wearing sunglasses !Various other rooms featuring a plethora of extinct animals, cats, whales, human evolution, insects and far too much to see in one visit. The most recent exhibit is 'Titanosaur' possibly the Biggestest dinosaur in the world ! It's just gone on display and requires a separate timed ticket so pre-book before you get there. There is a fee to see this exhibition but it has just gone on display so was extremely popular. I failed to get a ticket the night before so will have to visit again soon but no matter there really is so much to see on multiple levels, just make sure you get a map and as a tip start in the main hall, it has a Wow factor all of it's own.The only downside is, as with any free to enter museum, there's just too many people and they have a captive market for food and drink.",Trip
"April 7, 2023","Went in the morning we got there earlier than anticipated but we were still allowed in before hand so that was good. There was a big line for those who didn’t already book so definitely make sure to book before hand. It’s super close to the underground station so that’s handy and there’s a lot of museums close together so you can’t really get bored. There’s somewhere that will take your bags and coats if you pay, however it does cost £ so if you won’t want to pay make sure your bag is light. In some areas it does get packed but overall because of the size it isn’t too bad. The food is really good for the price and was very quick considering how busy it was. Found it really nice that there was people who worked there going through some extra information and even had fossils we were able to hold. If you want to do it all in one day you definitely need to be there for opening as there just so much to see. They have a really nice gift shop that has Jurassic Park merchandise which were all reasonably priced. The toilets were cleaned. There is plenty of space for wheelchairs when going around as well that was good.",Easter half term visit
"April 6, 2023","First advice- recommend pre-booking the free tickets or booking an encounter / experience as we had to queue for 1hr 15mins to get in.  Spent about 2hrs here- The red zone was good- enjoyed the volcano and earthquake exhibits but other sections dimly lit and had faded signage. Green zone- was interesting to see the actual size of animals, Hintz hall was amazing. Blue zone- hit and miss- great animatronic T rex and some dino skeletons but the mammal displays were really tired.",Similar experience to the tube at rush hour
"October 25, 2022","I couldn’t really review the quality of the museum or it’s exhibits as you simply cannot get near them due to how overcrowded this place is. We had tickets booked in advance, but you don’t need them as they’re never checked. I do wonder how they keep a track of the number of visitors inside. There’s very few staff about no doubt trying to avoid the crowds.You simply cannot get near anything for the crowds. Constantly been pushed and pulled in different directions if you try and stand for a second to view an exhibit. There is simply no point in a museum if you cannot get near anything. I think the tube at rush hour is less crowded.",Overcrowded
"February 23, 2023",Really disappointed with our visit. We were looking forward to visiting here and pre booked our time slot online as was recommended. When we turned up there seemed to be no reasoning behind the entrance system with no evidence of people leaving and ticket holders/none ticket holders being let in in large numbers. The contents of the museum are fantastic and the building special but we didn’t have a chance to enjoy this as there was no time to stop and read anything with so many people being there at the same time. If you stopped you were holding people up. This was particularly bad in the dinosaur area where everyone was packed in like sardines in a tin. You couldn’t stop and read and instead had to go with the movement of all the people around you (literally shoulder to shoulder). Felt like a massive health and safety issue with an accident waiting to happen. We ended up in the lower ground picnic area just to get a breather. We gave up on the volcano and earthquake zone as again it was just too busy.We expected it to be busy but there’s busy and then there’s just letting way too many people in. Our little girl ended up having a complete breakdown over it (after being bashed too many times) and just wanted to go out. What is the point of pre booking time slots if it’s not to control numbers?Overall a fantastic museum which is let down by being way too overcrowded.,"Still worth a visit, but... "
"July 18, 2022","Disappointingly dumbed down.A wonderful building, housing a wide range of fascinating objects, but overall in my view there is an overly modern focus on digital displays, animatronic dinosaurs and dramatic framing and staging of certain exhibits.Plenty of beautiful and historically important items, such as the marine reptile specimens, are sidelined to corridors to make room for more ""exciting"" models. The dinosaur gallery has some wonderful items but again the focus is generally on screens and models rather than the items themselves and their importance.Still well worth a visit but in my opinion it is less impressive than it was in times past. Then again I'm 58 and perhaps its aimed more at enthusing youngsters than entertaining fogies.I had lunch in the very nice T Rex Cafe, which is staffed by lovely helpful people.Who cant cook.I had the Fish Finger Sandwich, reasoning that that would be hard to cock up. I was wrong.Several bits of inedible dry fish hidden in an enormous chewy ciabatta. The side of fries were nice, as was the accompanying pint of Helles.Also, one last grumble. The museum was absolutely overwhelmed by school groups as I got there at opening time on Friday. Introducing kids to such a great institution is of course a very good thing.But the fact remains that it was impossible for other visitors to enjoy their visit due to the sheer number of pesky kids. Surely a compromise can be found? School-only times, longer opening hours, taping the kids mouths shut?Anyway, still glad I went.",Too many visitors allowed at the same time
"July 24, 2023",Museum was over-crowded even on Monday. Either visitors do not respect the times on their prebooked tickets or the museum allows too many visitors at the same time. There is absolutely no possibility to relax and enjoy what this museum offers. I am glad there is no entry fee since it would have been a waste of money.,Great family day out
"February 27, 2022","Absolutely fabulous day out. Went with my 4 year old who has an attention span of 3 seconds and he loved it. There is so much to see, we spent 4 hours there and still didn't see everything. The kids guide book for £5 is probably one of the best we've had - proper hard cover not these naff paper ones that don't last.Cafe was nice, bit expensive but aren't they all. Food was good quality though and even though it was heaving the tables were cleaned straight away and rubbish cleared. The staff inside were really friendly and engaging with us. It's easy to get from the tube and we'll signposted. My only complaint was the staff outside directly the entry queues did not have a clue! We were moved 3 times by staff telling us conflicting information. I have to pick up my son as there was not enough space near the tube entrance and people were getting squashed. This was met by the rudest woman I've ever encountered shouting at the lady Infront because she got pushed forward by the queue the staff had created! Not what you need with small children. However the rest of the staff were amazing and the place itself it brilliant. ",Heaving
"May 9, 2023","First off, the artifacts are amazing. No disputing that at all. I could go into detail but my entire experience was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of people that made it near impossible to enjoy. Some sections were just a 4 people wide queue, channelled through sections of the museum with no escape, no possibility to get closer to anything to view. Just jam packed. It was overall a disappointing experience and even my child felt uncomfortable so we just left early. I appreciate it is a free museum but why issue pre booked tickets just to overload the venue","give a donation, free venue"
"August 8, 2021","okay, I reviews the other museum and think I meant this one. lovely helpful staff and they take covid and safety of people and the ornaments serious! the only reason I gave 4* and not 5* is as there is a shop there with toys and things to buy (like a basic writing pad for £5!!! with?!) but for children and parents no where to eat or get a drink. so you are stuck in there and once you leave you leave.i understand they dont want people walking round with dirty/sticky fingers but it is a big drawback when you are there for an hour tired and with children. ",Trip with the kids
"October 2, 2020","Really enjoyed our trip but lots of galleries closed due to COVID, no David A!!!  Was also a little disappointed we couldn't get too close to some of the dinosaurs, they are hung from the ceiling and you can see the original walkway above but obviously not in use due to COVID.  Hand Sanitiser all around.  Only cold food available in one canteen.  You can take a packed lunch/picnic as there is an outside area within the museum especially for this.  Went for 11am slot and this was not long enough so will definitely be returning.  ",Wildlife Photographer of the Year - great exhibition
"December 13, 2022","Went in there to see the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Exhibition and can only recommend. Luckily I was in there first thing at 10h, so it was quite quiet and there weren't too many people in the exhibition. Afterwards I went to see also the permanent exhibition and didn't get disappointed - only a bit lost as it is huge and so many things to see. But there is always somebody from the staff around to help.",Amazing museum suitable for all ages
"August 27, 2022","This museum is huge which I believe one would need to spend more than 3 hours to visit all exhibits. The exhibits are categorized into 4 different zones. I personally love the red zone which is more about geology and planets. Other zones exhibits about the evolution, history and characteristics of dinosaurs, animals, insects, etc. It also got galleries on different stones, materials, gems, etc. The exhibits are interactive and the museum uses various ways to display. It is interesting and educational. Kids surely find it fun and as an adult, I found the presentation is clear, well organized, comprehensive yet easy to digest. The museum itself resembles a traditional British college, kind of Harry Potter type. The bricks, the arches, the stairs, the grand hall, the windows, all combines to make a great piece of architecture.  Good for photo taking of course!",Where's all the dinosaurs gone
"October 8, 2023","Very disappointed as I couple we both saw the museum when younger as it was amazing lots of dinosaurs everywhere in every room big and small but this time when we entered in the first huge hall there was only one dinosaur hung up in the air the whole floor was empty you could easily fill the floor with at least 5 big dinosaurs. We then went around the rest of the museum and saw other areas, rooms but no dinosaurs, finally saw the dinosaur section but was so small and only a few dinosaurs in there but of course not on the ground up off the floor and you had to follow a boring stupid path around the few dinosaurs you saw instead of them just being freely open to see. We saw the TRex and a few other dinosaurs but it had really changed to the way it use to be. It use to be and was so much better so many more dinosaurs. So where have they all gone. They had filled about 6 rooms up 3 with gift shops and 3 restaurants which in the past where filled with dinosaurs so we were very disappointed and we had done the whole museum in less than an hour which we thought would take 2-3hrs. They need to bring back the old museum the way it was before. Some rooms had a few pieces of art in which was wasted should have been filled with interesting dinosaurs. The national history museum needs to bring it back up to a 10 by bringing all dinosaurs back in the museum as before by filling the rooms not with gift shops and restaurants or bits of art but interesting dinosaurs!!! We were both so disappointed!",Great museum but be ready for the big crowd
"November 2, 2023","A great museum  with lots of things to do, make sure to plan which area you want to visit as it is very big and has lots od rooms and alleys to go through. It was during autumn break /half term break when we visited so it was very crowded. We booked our tickets online and that was such a good thing because there were people who have  been lining up for an hour and half.My son randomly found a lego activity where he had to design a home for him and a place of refuge for migrating birds. The museum.staff were very friendly and assisted him throughout.  This was such a grrat surprise we.didn't know of when we entered the museum.Though he profited from.the hakf term activitiy, I would suggest for first timers to avoid busy times here or book an earlier visit. The crowd was a bit of a turn off because you have to quickly go around to give way for others.",Must do with small children
"January 9, 2023","We popped in on our way back to our hotel. It is a huge museum and there is a lot to see but I think younger children will appreciate more that teenagers as it was not much interactive. Also some displays are old. I think the museums will build more on the imagination of younger children. If you have small children (<12 yo) then you are good if not, then there are nicer museums to visit.",A True History
"August 5, 2023","In July 2023,  i made a £7 donation to the Natural History museum. I will never forget that,  i went there to visit with my Grammer school from Manchester in the 1980s. The reason i made the donation and will continue to make donations is because its very educational rocks, Dinosours etc. I love the Natural History Museum, after all i was born on 4th July American independence day when George 3rd lost independence to the Americans. I therefore have Provinance to George 3rd and my surname Sharief means in Arabic Noble. I went to Paris to pay my respects to Princess Diana where the statue of liberty was built and given as a gift to the Americans. Thank you.",Simply Amazing!
"March 29, 2023","Where to begin? Where to  end? This museum is outstanding.  The displays are compelling and fascinating!  From dinosaurs to mummy’s to unusual rocks. We could have spent a week there, or a month, or a year and seen only a fraction of the collected items.As a special treat we took a behind-the-scenes tour of Darwin’s Samples. Our small group was led by an experienced guide who showed us  specimens from jellyfish to platypus. To see the samples in alcohol was fabulous given the impact that Darwin had on science and life on Earth.",Dangerously overcrowded 
"November 5, 2023","you simply could not enjoy a single thing at the museum because it was so crowded. my son almost got trampled at one point. so deeply disappointing for him, an avid nature and animal lover, we travelled from Ireland to visit the museum. I felt so tense and uneasy the entire time we were there and he felt frightened of the crowd so we left after an hour",Night at the museum
"February 13, 2022","We went to the museum's Valentine evening at last minute due to another event being cancelled due to Covid. But what a great evening. A glass of wine, wonderful harpist and a jazz band, screen printed a tote bag, stroked a snake and spoke to psssionate museum researchers. Seeing the beautiful museum in all its glory but less crowded was amazing. Definitely recommend it for 14th or next year if it is on. Didnt feel rushed at all so good value for money with activities and complimentary drink.",Fabulous museum but dodge the prams and pushchairs
"April 5, 2022","Its a great museum. Sadly as its free, which is great it is so busy. Huge family groups with babies in prams, kids running around and generally really really busy. I was there with my eldest daughter who has fond memories of this great place when she was old enough to appreciate how  amazing it is.",MAGNIFICENT!
"November 10, 2021",I remember visiting the Natural History Museum as a child and always enjoying the many displays.It was great to return and check it out. There are many amazing things to check out including the dinosaur exhibition and the Mammal room. I really enjoyed the earthquake exhibition and also the many natural rocks. There are a few gift shops to visit to get yourself a souvenir of your visit. Definitely worth checking out!,Too many people
"July 27, 2022","As a geology and geography student I had been to excited to visit this museum. Firstly, some of the museum was closed, which is completely fine because it’s so big. However you could not escape people, there were way too many people in this museum. Many school children running around and ruining it for others. I left early and didn’t see many parts. If this museum wasn’t free then I would definitely of been annoyed if I had paid for it.",Ruined by the crowds 
"May 2, 2022","On the surface this place is amazing and I would have given it 5 stars. The exhibits are out of this world and the staff are so knowledgeable and patient with children. We entered on Sunday morning so to start it wasn't too full so my son got a personalised experience looking at claws and teeth. The staff member was very knowledgeable and kept my son's attention and told my son how knowledgeable he was which made him feel amazing. What made it average was the amount of people the museum let in. Within 30 minutes you couldn't move in the place. The exhibits are not controlled so you can not enjoy and it makes it impossible for you to actually take anything in. Especially in the dinosaur area. It was completely ruined for our son who has ADHD and Autism. There was no control entering which means you couldn't read anything, the noise was unbearable for me let alone my child and people were pushing and shoving. My son asked to leave even though he wanted to see more. He couldn't cope with the chaos. I am very disappointed",London's wonderfully curated free museum that explores the natural world
"January 6, 2023","Here is another place I have been to many times but I recently treated my nephews and niece to a day trip to London and the museum, including a dinosaur mad nephew. The museum is still free and that is what makes the NHM such a wonderful attraction in London. There's loads for kids to educate themselves with and hopefully they'll learn something too.The only disappointment for me was how crowded it was and how stiflingly hot the museum was on a very warm August day. I'd been a year earlier on a solo trip and it had been January. I would actually suggest there is no reason why you can't visit the museum out of holiday season. Not that i blame the NHM for allowing the crowds to flock in. Hopefully they get a good income from all the crowds in the summer. It is a wonderful UK institution and hopefully remains free for all time.I will note that you can donate to the museum but it is wonderful that it will always be there for everyone to enjoy, regardless of income. If you can afford to donate then please do so. It helps keep these attractions going.",Can't wait to go again
"November 28, 2022","Last week we went on a school trip to the Natural History museum. We came by train to Victoria station, then took the underground.  It was an easy trip and the walk from the tube station to the museum was quick.The museum was cool and the exhibits were interesting. My favourite was the mammal exhibit and seeing the whale. We didn't get to see everything, so i would like to visit again. The earthquake simulator wasn't the best, but the rest was good.I recommend that family, friends and children should visit the Natural history Museum.",If you like this sort of thing
"September 26, 2021","A few people said to go here so we did, no queues we went straight in, first thing I noticed was the staff were quite pushy for everyone to leave a £5 or £10 donation on entry, this was at entry point and I thought well let me see what its all about first and how good it is and then I will decide.Sorry to say it was pretty boring for me, I did not see anything that really took my interest, volcanos and earthquakes along with loads of rocks and dust movements.Apparently they get over 5 million visitors a year which is great for them, possibly because its free admission though, but its not for me.",Nature’s wonders in an amazing setting
"June 5, 2021","We took our little ones for their first visit and as usual it didn’t disappoint. The booking process was simple and effective.We visited several galleries including the dinosaurs and they loved every minute.  They had fun learning about the amazing exhibits and enjoyed some of the interactive displays, making a volcano etc. Throughout the museum is immaculately clean.  There are numerous well stocked hand sanitisers. The cafe has a range of well priced snacks snd light meals.The guides were very friendly, keen to help and great with the kids.",Unfairly treated
"June 28, 2021","Felt like without pre booking tickets was penalized unnecessarily forced to wait longer in large cue whilst pre booked ticket cue was empty for while. When entered had locked suitcase checked, bottle of open alcohol was inside from a few days in london sightseeing trip. Even tho it was not hidden and remaining in locked suitcase going in locker before walking around, was refused entry unless disposed, which even Houdini would of found impossible to take sip from, especially annoying when other visitor where told behind me carry on in without bags being checked. Very disappointing after great experience with other attractions.",Far to many people
"September 24, 2023","Very disappointed with our first ever visit to the museum. I appreciate that the museum is free to get in and donations are voluntary however the museum was ridiculously full. My 8 year old walked in and wanted to walk straight back out. We barely saw anything as there was so many people in there that you couldn’t get close to anything to look at, take pictures. Nothing. We were in there 45 minutes and left. Every one pushing and shoving each other, it was so warm in there it was over whelming. Real spoilt our trip there and to be honest we wouldn’t be in a rush to go back. Not with numbers like that in there. Real shame",You can't go wrong with free entry. Fantastic way to spend a few hours.
"March 26, 2022","a month agoIconic London museum which is a must see for the whole family.This stunning building houses a natural history collection dating back billions of years. It's a huge place with many different sections and it's very difficult to do the whole thing in one go. It's free though and you can come back again.Dinosaurs, human evolution, volcano and earthquake zones are just some of the things to see and enjoy. With a number of cafes, plenty of bathrooms and gift shops, there is something for everyone. The architecture of the actual museum is beautiful and we had an amazing time.",Pleasant to go now it’s now so busy
"June 21, 2021","During covid times, it’s a much more pleasant experience- not too busy and bookable slots. We haven’t been for 15 years, and back then it was so busy you couldn’t really see all anything with small children. Now the kids are grown up and times are different, it’s clean, spacious and well signed. The toilets are spotless, cafes available ( we didn’t use) . My only criticism is it closes at 6, so we struggled to see everything and we arrived at 2.45.",Fantastic day
"December 3, 2022","I visited the Natural History Museum with my 14-year-old son and it was certainly a day to remember!As we visited on a Friday, the Museum was not too busy, which meant we could have a leisurely walk round without having to rush. To get there, we travelled to London Bridge Station and got a black cab to the Museum. On the way, we saw plenty of London landmarks such as Trafalgar Square, the Shard and Tower Bridge.The Museum itself was incredibly interesting; the best parts were the massive Blue Whale skeleton and the dinosaur area. We ate in the T-Rex restaurant which offers a wide range of lovely food. I had a naked chicken burger and my son had a fish finger sandwich, both of which came with salad and chips.We would definitely recommend the Museum to others. We will visited again!!!!","""Gargantuan"""
"June 24, 2022","As a Jurassic Park addict, as soon as I entered the main hall of the museum. It just reminded me of a movie “Night at the museum” don't ask me why. It is a gargantuan museum that has a place to display skeletons of the most famous lived animal t-rex to the largest living animal whale. The museum has a vast range of fossils, also skeletons of dinosaurs and mammals. The mastodon skeleton is my favorite, which helped me connect with the movie Ice Age. Lots of stuffed animals to check out. There is a display of two giraffes where one is just the skeleton of a giraffe and the other is a stuffed one which looks real. Then there is an elephant family from big ones to small that is such a great site to watch. Other than the objects displayed, the architecture of a building itself is a fruitful site to visit. Overall a must visit place in London.",Worth a visit - but don't go on weekends
"August 17, 2022","Certainly one of the most amazing museums in London, and it's huge! You'll need at least 4 hours based on my experience to ""see"" everything, but not in detail. Better plan a whole afternoon for the visit. The best time would be in the morning. Don't go on weekends, as it can become super crowded. Some areas are quite warm, make sure you carry some water with you. The museum is okay for kids, but it's quite a long visit so make sure you plan for enough breaks and entertainment.",All things nature
"October 29, 2023","I love natural history museums and the NHM is my favourite of all. The builing is beautiful, the Hintze hall utterly impressive, and the latest Treasure galleries mesmerising. It's easy to get around and every now and then staff brings out some artefacts to show you and let you hold.It tends to get crowded during the weekend, so a weekday visit is best.They ran a Jurassic Park 30th anniversary pop-up shop which was whimsically fun.",Poor social distancing management
"June 11, 2021","The museum exhibitions were fine, however I did not feel at all  Covid secure in several areas of the building...* No social distancing whatsoever in popular sections such as the dinosours zone.* No attempt by staff to limit the number of people entering the popular / busy areas.* Many children not wearing masks.* Insufficient hand sanitiser stations around the building.I felt a lot less safe than shopping in a supermarket or travelling on a train.",Amazing experience and delicious food in the cafe!
"August 15, 2022",This was amazing - from the displays to the food.  Even though is was FULL of people (summer holidays) the experience was fantastic.  So much to see and do.  The food in the restaurant was the best I have ever had in a museum - so much choice of delicious fresh food - the chef/chefs obviously love their job! Thank you!,Loved it!
"October 21, 2020","I loved this museum. I've been wanting to go for a long time now and I'm so glad it finally happened. Quite often you look at places and it says you will spend this much time at the venue and generally it ends up a lot less than stated. NHM say 4 hours. We were in here longer. There is so much to see, so much to learn. I think a forgotten area of the museum is the zoology area. Personally, this was one of my favourite parts but my interests are within this. But it is amazing to look in jars and see how well animals and plants have kept over the years. ",Wouldn't come back.
"August 7, 2023","Absolutely heaving inside,clearly don't limit the numbers of people coming in to actually make the place enjoyable. Can't really see any of the attractions because of the mounds of people already looking at them,hence why limiting the number of people who come in would be a good idea. Boiling hot inside don't think there is any air conditioning. Place isn't clearly signposted to find where all the exhibits are. Did expect a lot more from this museum,and won't return.",Loved the dinosaur and earthquake exhibits
"June 14, 2022","This is a must visit while in London.  We liked this more than the other museums.  The dinosaur exhibit was fantastic.  Very educational (as was every exhibit) and plenty of large scale models.  Felt like I was living in the age of dinosaurs.  The earthquake and volcano exhibits were also exceptional.  One of the rooms simulates the shaking that happens during an earthquake.  They also have insect exhibits, ""Sea Monster"" and Coral Reef exhibits.  All are excellent.  Best to allow an entire day for your visit.  ",Titanosaur exhibition totally over gamified. Not suitable for adults.
"July 20, 2023","Sadly, the exhibition is totally over-gamified.  To find out information you have to play games, lift flaps, pump fake hearts.  Why can't we just read that information? The gamification just means it takes more time to learn anything and if you're in the middle of trying find something out, some little brat comes along unsupervised and takes over randomly pushing buttons or flipping things over not learning anything at all.  And of course you can't say anything to a child these days. Sadly, this is the way of most of the rest of the museum: not designed for adults at all, and pitched at children who are allowed to run riot and are unlikely to learn anything. The two stars are for 1) the art work of the titanosaur exhibition which is delicately beautiful and 2) the actual construction of the exhibition  in modular form so it can be transported easily. I'm afraid 0 for content.  It really is not worth the £16. ",Not to be missed
"July 22, 2022","We took our 4 year Granddaughter here to see the cbeebies Andy's Prehistoric adventures clock, which we did. However, she loved every part of the museum, including all of the animals and interact activities. Will definitely visit again, not to be missed. Book your tickets online before your visit.",Impressing - and the Great Hall is fantastic
"April 2, 2023","The Natural History Museum is a magnificent museum with so much to see - for everyone. Of course, the dinosaur skeleton was the highlight for many. Personally, I was actually most impressed by the large hall where the blue whale skeleton hangs. An absolutely beautiful building! I stood for a really long time and just looked at the hall itself, but also all the details. I was ""awakened"" by a guard who whispered: I cannot see enough of the hall either - it was obvious what I was so fascinated by.",Wonderful for anyone really
"February 7, 2020","The layout of the museum was superb. I went on a weekday around 11 and there were a few groups of school children but other than that it was not packed. I enjoyed several displays, the hummingbird collection which lovely. This museum also has a nice area for eating and affordable gift shops.",Tad bit disappointing
"June 5, 2023",We felt a tad bit disappointed with this museum and expected it to be bigger. It was pretty overcrowded and felt more suited for school children instead of adults. I would recommend families with young children to visit! It was still a fair bit interesting to see but we were out within an hour.,Worth every second you spend there.
"May 9, 2022","Book online and go early to save time at the entrance and avoid crowds.Takes about 1 1/2 - 2 hours to see. I wish they had more stuff at the museum store as the availability of T-shirts for example was very limited in terms of sizes, which is a shame.",Lovely
"November 18, 2021",This was the best museum we went to on our trip. We went to the science museum and the British museum and this one was way better then the other two. Shame you have to pay soo much to get into the fantastical beats section I hope they know that the price they put on that is the same price to actually go to the Harry Potter studio tour ….. Found it cheeky that they still allow you into the gift shop to buy stuff though LOL!! The rest of the museum was really good and enjoyable ! Love ice rink outside too but way to busy to go on it,Wonderful!
"February 13, 2022","One of the most stunning buildings in the world, and an inspiring day out for all ages.  Thank you for the left-luggage facility, the good food in the cafe and the interesting books in the gift shop. We especially enjoyed the Broken Planet' exhibition - very accessible and thought provoking.",Waste of money and time
"November 17, 2021",Terrible. Arrived at 7pm for 8pm session. Queued for 25 mins to still not get a drink at the bar. Joined queue for ice skating at 7:30 and waited past our session  (not option of session being extended because of their slowness!). Very disappointing. This is a Wednesday night - staff simply said “it’s busy”. It’s only busy because you oversold tickets. This is a money making scam. Don’t buy a ticket you won’t even get a full session or your free drink if you buy a deal.,Needs modernising and quickly
"April 17, 2022","Far too many visitors packed in. Literally like a theme park with queues inside. Also, the museum needs to be modernised - very little has changed in the last 25 years (videos made in the 1970s still be shown upstairs). Sadly also the canteen was very dirty, with food/ drink stains splattered on the wall. A real shame and with someInvestment and modernisation this could be excellent but needs dragging into the 21st century","Brilliant, definitely worth a donation"
"March 6, 2023","I visited here with a friend a couple of weeks ago and must say we had a really informative and enjoyable time. There are so many things to look at and read about, definitely allow a good few hours to walk around here; we foolishly didn’t give ourselves enough time so it was a bit of a rush. My favourite part however (as I’m sure is the same for everyone) was the dinosaur exhibition which was brilliant. This museum is even more amazing considering there is technically no entry fee- it’s definitely worth a donation if you can afford it.",Must Do London Trip
"August 3, 2022",WOW what a place. So much to see and explore. I would recommend pre-booking your tickets to beat the queues and start at the beginning of the day. We spent nearly 6 hours there and could have spent longer. If you have the option of returning soon I would suggest just focusing on a couple of areas rather than trying to see it all in one go. We ate lunch there and it was tasty and reasonably priced. It is great for children who have an interest in the world or an inquisitive mind.,Great Titanosaur exhibit at the Natural History Museum
"April 25, 2023","Booked to see the Titanosaur exhibition at the Natural History, a fantastic exhibition well worth going if you can. Booking is a must if you want to avoid the long queues outside. The only downside is that the staff were not particularly knowledgeable and couldn’t really answer any questions we had.",Amazing!
"March 18, 2022","I knew this place was big but not THAT big!! The building itself is just bloody beautiful,victorian artictecture at it's finest.We didn't get to see all of the exhibits but what we did see was fantastic,you need to get there early and spend the best part of a day there to really appreciate it there's just so much to see.I felt very humbled and a little ashamed at what we have done(and are doing) to this beautiful planet and I'm no Greta Turnberg fan!",Step back in time
"June 18, 2022","The museum is in need of a good cleaning.  Dusty exhibits everywhere, the price is right for admission (free).  The sections of the museum not related to minerals /rocks are worth while .  Unless a geologist avoid the rock section.  Kids will love the nature and dinosaur exhibits.",Too busy
"November 5, 2022","I am sure that this is a good museum but unfortunately it was far too busy to appreciate or enjoy. I would advise to go first thing when it opens when hopefully it is quieter.On the website it says you have to pre book tickets for a time slot, but this is pointless as nobody asked to see ours at the door. Maybe this was why it was so busy",Amazing place to visit
"July 7, 2023","Beautiful building with lots of fascinating things too see. The skeleton of the blue whale is amazing. The only down side was how busy the dinosaur exhibit was, it was hard to actually see anything well in there, perhaps timed tickets would be an idea to reduce the number of people going through at once as it is clearly a very popular area of the museum and also splitting up school groups into smaller numbers as sometimes it was hard to get around them.",impossibly overcrowded and so stressful we had to leave after 30 minutes
"March 31, 2023","We arrived around 2pm on Friday and there was no queue so went straight in. Walking into the main entrance it did seem busy. We tried to go to the toilets but the queue was so big we gave up. We walked up the stairs to the minerals section and it felt like every exhibit was just in busy corridors with people standing blocking the way or walking in different directions, bumping into each other. It felt exactly like rush hour on the underground and I saw one of the other reviewers said similar. On top of that, of the few exhibits we did see, many seemed to be merely replicas/models and not actual specimens which was very disappointing. The map/signs were also confusing and unhelpful as they have various colour zones but there is no explanation of what these zones are. The whole place just seemed in total disarray.In the end fighting through hoards of people just became completely overwhelming so we gave up and left. So disappointed as had high expectations. British Museum was much better, although we did visit that on a Wednesday and I don't know if that made all the difference. Will not go back.",Have you heard of virtual tour to beautiful cultural place?
"March 31, 2022","I visited The Natural History Museum of London virtually. Yes, you read right. I visited this beautiful place at my home. with the help of Google Art & Culture Application. I got a chance to see those incredible dinosaur skeletons and beautiful architecture. it was a nice experience using that Google Art & Culture App! but I found it troubling. while moving towards a side, as when you try to move in a particular direction. the app starts zooming that particular area. The rest of the experience was good. this app has so many features like you can take a photo and transform it with classic artworks, you can Discover portraits that look like you, you can Find art by using the colors of your photo, you can Wander through immersive galleries and get up close to art and much more. Their visual qualities and architecture details were so good.",Enjoyed my little tour
"February 15, 2023","I had some spare time and decided to visit this museum, found it quite easy, it's off South Kensington underground station and the way to it is clearly signposted, it's a fair walk but not too bad. Entrance to the museum is free of charge, but you can contribute by donating at the entrance, that is highly appreciated by the museum staff. Staff in the museum is friendly and helpful. There are plenty facilities and local cafeteria as well. ",Not all museums are created equal
"May 28, 2023","Not all museums are created equal, this one stands out. The atmosphere created by the architecture and fittings are a bit special and the exhibits are beautifully presented.  It was too hot, but this might be to preserve the artifacts, it was also overcrowded, but that's not surprising given what's on offer. Well worth visiting. ",Busy! 
"August 28, 2023","As with most places in London I was fully expecting the museum to be full of life. It is still as breath taking as I remember from childhood, but oh my just so so many people. With my disabilities I found this to be a really unenjoyable experience, people pushing past me, banging into me, not giving me enough space to view and enjoy the exhibits. It was a shame as I was very much looking forward to reliving some of my childhood. If you can stand crowds and noise it is definitely worth a visit though as its beautiful ",Covid positive!!!
"August 5, 2022","Scored this so low as no point having a booking or time slot for Dippy as they crammed as many people in as possible!! It was sweltering, being pushed along with everyone breathing down each other’s neck!! Fans were blowing the hot, humid air around and the exhibits that you could touch well I think we were sadly one of the few families that did use hand gel!! Two days later and I’ve had positive LFT and feel poorly!! The museum itself is beautiful with many mind blowing exhibits it’s just a shame we hated the experience due to overcrowding!!!",Far too busy
"August 5, 2022","We booked on line as requested but there is no point. No checks made and no queue (despite it being about midday) they just let everyone in. Consequently, the museum was far too crowded. It was like being on a conveyer belt of people in many areas, not just the dinosaurs. We just all shuffled along together. The whole museum was overly busy and hence unpleasant.It is also very hot. Whilst this is down to the weather and the museum did have a few large fans around, it is not helped by the cheapest drink being £2.50!The idea of booking a time slot to avoid the infamous queues is an excellent idea and one I hope the museum continues with, but the museum needs to check these bookings and limit numbers to a more reasonable amount.",Disappointing planning
"August 5, 2022","The actual museum is amazing! Sadly, we didn’t get to experience it. We booked timed entrance tickets, but on arrival no tickets were being checked whatsoever. Because of this, the museum was packed. We physically couldn’t move. If we tried to stop to view anything, we were pushed along. At one point, we were told to keep moving by a member of staff, how can we appreciate the museum constantly moving? We tried to get food in the cafe but the children’s lunch bags all had a bag of popcorn in. This is a major choke risk for under 4’s! Please revise. Overall, so disappointed. We’d come from york so unfortunately won’t be able to re-attempt anytime soon!",Love IT!
"August 4, 2022","I love this museum! There is so much to see,  make sure you do a full day there. Children will love exploring, it is educational and fun! Bring your own food as a bit pricey. Be ready to que if need be. ",Super size museum!
"August 4, 2022","Great place. Free to visit, but we left a donation. Lots to see and do! Some very fascinating exhibits! Very easy to get lost! The place is massive. Sadly It was extremely busy and we could barely move freely , that coupled with the fact there is no air con, and it being incredibly hot inside didn’t make a comfortable experience.They advise to book a ticket to guarantee entry, we did this but don’t bother because they never checked our tickets, we just got let in.",Spoilt by its own success.
"August 4, 2022","It's just too busy to enjoy, and we were there on a day with no queue to get in.Also the dinosaur exhibit is completely shut currently. Not much fun. I'd recommend the Science Museum next door as a much better alternative for kids or adults.",Extremely busy
"August 4, 2022","This is a great place to visit and Dippy was fantastic to see again! A great free trip out in London that I will more than likely do again.While this was a lovely experience it was damped by the fact that it was so busy that I missed a few displays. You don’t have to book tickets online you can just turn up though it will be a longer wait to get in if you haven’t booked online. Though this is pretty pointless as nobody checks your time-slot so I don’t really understand the point in picking a time. It is also very, very hot throughout. The dinosaur exhibit was unbearable at one point with us all cramped in their so if you are to visit when warm bring lots of water. I went to buy a drink and it was £2.50 for a single can of Diet Coke! However there was a free refillable water station that I and others made the most of.",Not as good as it used to be
"August 4, 2022",The experience is dumbed down by a reduction of exhibits and terrible lighting so you can't see the specimens very well - or they are artistically arranged but many are too high to view properly. Routes herded people through the exhibits. I remember when it was so much better as a child when the dinosaurs were in the main hall and you didn't need buttons to press or trick lighting to make the specimens impressive. You were also at liberty to tour the specimens as you wanted to.,"Interesting and interactive museum, extremely hot inside on hot days, drink lots!! "
"August 4, 2022","We went here for the first time as a family. There is lots to see and do. Really interesting interactive aspects. We all enjoyed the dinosaurs and whales areas. The downsides were how hot it was, esp in some rooms.  Clearly August is a hot month but with the understandable crowds and the heat we didn't stay as long as we would have liked. Getting there as doors open is a top tip. We will come back another time as we did enjoy it. ",Fantastic variety.
"August 3, 2022","A great place to visit, if you have a choice between the natural history museum and the British Museum, chose the natural history.",Too busy! Couldn't enjoy it. Pre-booked tickets worked well for us.
"August 1, 2023","I visited with my 12 year old son. It was sooo busy! You couldn't move freely around exhibits, which made it difficult to view and very hot. The weather was wet outside, so I dread to think how it would be on a hot day. They had fans on but it wasn't enough. If the museum restricted visitors a little it would be a wonderful place to visit. We ended up leaving not long after getting there.We pre-booked our tickets which worked well - we walked straight in.",Crowded!
"February 15, 2023","Was there on a saturday, booked tickets the day before and earliest was 13.15. To say this place was crowded is an understatement. Way too many people to enjoy everything. I found the dinosaurs the most interesting, but in that room you were stuffed like fish in a barrel. It's nice to have been there, but I have been to museums that I liked alot better.",Great museum
"June 4, 2023","Beautiful museum, lots to see and we were lucky to visit during half term and there were a couple of dinosaur related activities and shows for the children, the show in particular was great and very funny. The museum building itself is stunning. Staff were helpful. Didn't have to queue as we prebooked tickets, but queue for those that didn't have tickets was crazy.","Nice, but expected a bit more"
"September 8, 2023","We expected a bit more to be honest, we felt the museum is mostly for children and doesn't have that much on display, given the colossal building size  (for example no insects were on display in the 'creepy crawlies' and a large part of the museum is about vulcanos and earthquake). Does have a lot of rocks in the earth exhibition. None the less it was a nice visit, dinosaurs are worthwhile and impressielve main halls. ",An attraction on our London attraction itinerary
"September 12, 2021",Spent 3 hours here. The David Attenborough part for really good in respect to the current state of the planet. Not too impressed with the museum overall. Probably not what we really expected therefore more research prior to the visit would have been beneficial,Good experience but ridiculously crowded
"August 8, 2022","Great selection of things to see, learn and do. Very educational and fun but the museum was ridiculously crowded. We felt like sardines in a can, you almost couldn't even walk through the people, not speaking about seeing anything. So come during week days/early (we were there on Sunday morning). However the staff and the organization are great, toilets and seats everywhere, water fountains etc.",Titanosaur overpriced
"August 21, 2023","NHM has always been a family favourite and I am now taking my gandchildren. They are still at the dinosaur stage but do get something from other exhibits. Main focus of the visit today was the Titanosaur exhibition. This is well done and the kids enjoyed it BUT it was dear and there were few genuine exhibits - mainly  screen based exhibits. As an adult if I had paid full price for myself I would not have found it good value. Also it is ""exit through the gift shop"" which makes buying a toy hard to avoid - but be warned a model titanosaur is £22!!Overall I think some exhibits feel a little worn out and some have been replaced by shops. A bit more of staff explaining and interacting would be appreciated to add life to some galleries.",History in a building
"August 28, 2023","It is astounding how much history you can cram into 1 place.   The exhibits are extraordinary and some breathtaking. I particularly liked the collection of gems and the gigantic tree as a focal point, but the whale dinosaur at the heart of the building is a nice touch. It is very confusing to navigate if you don't have a map and very easy to get lost due to the enormous size of the building.",Truly horrible 
"January 11, 2020","I've been to many a museum in my life, and this was such a disappointment. I went there for the dinosaurs, looking forward to a waste selection of great specimens being displayed in various ways. What I got can be best described as a McDonalds display crammed into 1 small room where kids and adults were pushed through tight walkways while looking at plastic casts and just boring displays I was in Vienna, Austria and their museum before Christmas....1000 times better. Class, amazing pieces. This was utter garbage ",Great place to visit
"June 4, 2021",Came here with 2 five year olds and a 10 year old. So much to see and we had a fabulous time. After the kids had seen the dinosaurs however they got a bit bored but we had done most of the museum so not too bad. Such a good time though and would come back again. Would be great to see more interactive things for the children and I must say that the staff were lovely and very knowledgeable,"Vast, Impressive and Overwhelming - from the entrance walk through the architecture and each and every detailed exhibit."
"March 23, 2023","Wonderful. Overwhelming! I spent a very quick 2.5 hrs there and barely made it past the massive jewel and mineral displays! I confess to being a bit spoiled as we live a stone’s throw from the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, but from the entrance onward, London’s NHM holds its own and more. Plan to on my next visit!",Worth a visit but...
"January 26, 2020",Travelling alone with 4 year old girl. I made a bee line for here. It was really good and she enjoyed it. We whizzed through a lot of it and she was enjoying it but was not massively blown away. I would recommend going though. Took about 2 hours of the day. TRex Grill. Massive let down. Got my daughter's order wrong three times. Staff too busy chatting tbh. Portion size good and cost was alright but staff annoyed me tbh. Been there and done it now. Deffo worth a visit though with 4 year old but don't make it the wow factor highlight of your trip.,Wildlife photographer of the year exposition
"June 4, 2021","Always a pleasure to visit this museum, even with the current conditions. We went there with my daughter to see the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exposition and it was a great experience.First, the safety was really taken care seriously which is obviously essential today. Despite the location of the exposition was not really clear from the entrance (this hall is always so overwhelming by its size and beauty!), staff was very helpful and friendly so we made our way to it relatively easily.The ambiance was very nice and photos were beautiful, impressive and some what disturbing on the ""journalism"" part of the expo about what humans can unfortunately do to nature and animals.All the photographies were impressive in their way and it was very difficult to determine which ones would be the winner... it is so subjective to everyone sensibility, despite the techiaues and the work involved behind the photo itself.Great experience anyway which recall if necessary the beauty of our planet and creatures living on it.","If you love crowds and rush-hours tube like vibe, go for it."
"May 1, 2023",What happened to this once lovely and charming museums? Incredibly crowded and hot. I felt like fainting the entire time we navigated the narrow corridors seeing nothing but other people. The suspended catwalk that allowed for a close look at the dinosaurs is now closed and all is left is to look at them from below. I felt incredibly overwhelmed and worried about the safety of my 4 years old possibly getting lost or hurt. We will mot return to this museum.,"Overcrowded, lots of pushing and shoving"
"April 26, 2023","The exhibitions were interesting, the only downside was you couldn’t enjoy them! The museum lets in far too many people. There is an online booking service but that doesn’t cap the amount of people. I spent my whole day being shoved and pushed out the way. We came from Australia and were disappointed with how little time we had to look at exhibits. Disappointing trip",Incredible museum for kids.
"March 12, 2023","I brought my kids to this place and we had a wonderful time. The exhibits were a hit with the kids, especially the dinosaurs. However, it can be quite crowded with school groups, and the layout can be a bit challenging to navigate. Despite these minor issues, I would still highly recommend this place as a must-visit destination for kids.",Great museum in a great building
"July 26, 2023","The museum is located in a great building. The entrance hall is huge and very impressive. This by itself makes it already worthwhile the visit. There is no charge at the door, but they do ask for a donation. For special exhibitions they do charge you extra. To get around you will need some time. They have the biggest gem stone collection I have ever seen, but also the other departments are very impressive",Amazing
"December 16, 2022",Me n my husband went to eat something From the Kitchen which is inside the history museum and david one of their member helped us enormously and we just wanna say thanks a lot David from the kitchen from me n my husband . You are so kind and lovely and made us feel so comfortable and happy.Grace joy,Awesome. 
"January 23, 2020",My second visit and just one of the most beautiful museums you will ever visit. It's free entry with queuing times non existent during the week but long on weekends. Worth a visit alone just to look up at Dippy in the great hall. ,Fascinating museum
"April 30, 2023","This is undoubtedly one of the greatest museums in UK and a real must-see in London. Dinosaurs, volcanoes, minerals, animals, earthquakes, there is all of this and much more. On top of that the building itself is wonderful. Natural History Museum is a real gem, worth seeing.",Amazing

"January 6, 2020",On arrival at the museum the queue was long but moved fast. It was very crowded and we were told that it’s normal for school holidays. My son absolutely loved the dinosaur exhibits. The architecture is absolutely stunning. Well worth the visit if you have a dinosaur obsessed kid like mine. ,Got bored!
"January 14, 2022","Yes i have been many times before over the years and really enjoyed it, but this time i was bored and i'm not sure why.Was it the fact that you wore facemasks or that many exhibits looking tired now or something else, I don't know. We only stayed for less than 2 hours including half hour in cafe.  ",Holiday visit 
"September 4, 2023","Pre booked free tickets, thank god as queue was around the block and the same when we left, we just went straight to the front and in . Went upstairs first which was the boring bit, all rocks , earth, space etc, we missed a lot out as my son was only really interested in the rest. Spent 2 hrs, was far too busy with people but managed to see what we wanted, dinosaur part the best, didn’t pay extra to see the touring dinosaur which I personally think should be free but there you go. He enjoyed the animals etc. would we go again, no, would we have been happy if we had to pay, no, slot of stuff of no interest and just too many people squashed inside!!!!",Like a war zone :( dangerous
"August 17, 2022","The NHM is aware of COVID right? And that right now there is an amber warning for heat?!There were people panicking trying to get out of the dinosaur exhibition, I had to half carry half drag my daughter out of there through an emergency exit (which I got told off for), because she was fainting. It WAS an emergency, if she’s gone down she would have been trampled!Kids were being pushed out the way of adults and it was just appalling. I’m going to send an email to the H&S exec as this is just dangerous. Totally ruined our trip to London :(",Wonderful! Just need more crowd control in some areas
"August 19, 2021",Beautiful building with loads to see and learn! A great time had by all! Seeing our dinosaur mad sons face light up was just such a beautiful thing. We loved it! My only negative point is that the dinosaur part and mammals should have been better controlled especially at the moment. It was very over crowded and that made me feel very uneasy. People pushing past and ontop of eachotherThe rest was absolutely fine,Wau!
"February 15, 2020","I can't believe it's free access, so much to see!  I strongly recommend you to visit and experience.  we were on a rainy day and there were more people than normal but it didn't bother because the place was so big.  it's worth taking the time to see everything, because there's a lot of it.",Not enjoyable
"August 23, 2022","Some very interesting pieces of history. However there was far too many people and the heat was unbearable. We booked tickets for the Dippy exhibit but these weren't being checked so it was a free for all. Its a shame they try and get as many people in as possible to get them to spend money in the restaurants, cafes and shops.... ruins the experience. They also need to limit the numbers and install some air conditioning or ventilation. I know its free but would rather pay in to be able to enjoy it.",Lots to see
"April 17, 2023","Visited the museum during Easter Holidays - booked in advance (definitely recommend this!). Walked straight in and although it was busy it didn’t feel too crowded. Spent longer there than we though - almost 4 hours. Kids (age 13 & 10) really enjoyed it, especially the interaction.",Crowded but iconic & impressive
"August 11, 2022","Firstly, what a magnificent building. You could spend all day here, we spent a couple of hours as young children need variety. Lots of Charles Darwin’s work/findings featured plus, of course, the family favourite: dinosaurs!",One of the greatest museums and completely for free!
"December 30, 2022",Fantastic museum with a huge collection! It was way too crowded for a relaxed visit though. Offering this free of charge in this absurd expensive city was a welcome surprise. Great variety and the dino area was just packed with cool stuff. Don’t forget to enjoy the architecture too!,The Amazing Spirit Tour!
"August 21, 2023","I went to Dinosnores back in April which was a bucket list experience. I went on the Spirit Tour then and decided to take my partner in August as I enjoyed it so much. There was only 4 people in the group which was great as it meant a more personal experience. MASON was our NHM Educator. He was very informative, enthusiastic amd friendly. He clearly loved his job and made the experience educational and interesting. We got to see behind the scenes including, specimens of all sorts as well as many of Darwin's items from his trip on the Beagle. I don't think many people know about this trip but it's truly worthwhile. Highly recommended amd great value for money. £25 for 45 mins to  60 mins. ",Excellent but avoid the T-Rex Cafe
"April 8, 2023","One tip, book beforehand so you can enter through the fast track queue otherwise you’re in for a long wait.  We also booked for the dinosaur exhibition which was awe inspiring.  Worth a visit.  It’s all very well organised.  I’d avoid the T-Rex cafe. Lots of staff but complete chaos.  We had to keep asking for food/items which they kept forgetting. Seriously don’t bother. Go to the other one.",Great but kids probably with cope with it all.
"May 30, 2023",We enjoyed our visit. The dinosaur section was the biggest hit with the kids although they also enjoyed the other animal sections. The earthquake floor is great. It is a bit generally limited on interactivity though and we didn’t do all the floors due to that as the kids got bored,Amazing Museum with so so Much to See!
"February 16, 2020","Arrived at this fantastic building and saw fabulous displays. So much to see we selected what interested us. The first was Earthquakes...terrific displays and information including a shaking shop from Japan! I have experienced an earthquake first hand and this display was spot on. The dinasours were fabulous, the rocks and fossils...it would be possible to stay for hours and I guarantee you would not be bored! Excellent for everyone.",Must must visit
"March 2, 2020","Its a great place to visit in london. Its free. And its full of knowledge. U need to spend around 4 hrs here. If u have a longer stay in london, then i would suggest u visit this place in 2-3 visits. Each time covering a specific section",The most impressive was dinosaur section
"January 26, 2020",Fantastic building but inside is equally great. Our kids were the most impressed visiting dinosaur section. Also mammals section was highly interesting for them. Worth to highlight that this museum is free of charge.,Some real gems interspersed with tired displays from the 1980s and screaming kids.
"January 31, 2022","The original building is fantastic and the main hall with the whale made the visit worth it, however the majority of the displays are in need of an overhaul.  The mammals section hasn't changed since the 80s I'm guessing.  The colour scheme, text and displays in general were actually very nostalgic.  Highlights were the broken world exhibition, gem room, vault and treasures galleries.  Make a beeline for these displays and you will be happy.  If there isn't a cue, a zip around the dinosaur room is worth it, some great items spaced amongst the children exhibits.  By the time we made it to the evolution and red galleries we were spent and headed to Hyde Park for some fresh air.",Above and beyond
"July 27, 2023",Genuinely can’t thank the NHM staff enough! Took my 5yr old there who had found a “dinosaur bone” on the beach the week before…. Not only did I want to throw it away but already had and elaborate scheme to say it had gone.We got the the info desk and they took the bone and made my son feel like a superstar for finding it! He had the time of his life! It’s worth buying the £11 pack for kids as his got a VIP lanyard and gift bagThe fact that this place is free is crazy as it is a fantastic journey through time in a spectacularly mesmerising setting.A phenomenal place with fantastic people,Wonderful place to spend a day at!
"February 26, 2023","The place had tons of interesting exhibits.  The only problem was there were lots of school field trips the day we visited, therefore it was crowded with kids.  Sadly not able to visit the Sir David Attenborough studio (closed to public, open to student/class pre-bookings only), I would have loved to see this as I'm a fan of his TV series/shows.",Lovely afternoon out
"February 26, 2023","Helpful staff, greeted on arrival, organised well.The food court However was chaotic… could do with moving the fridges or roping them off as I witnessed people taking things an walking away without paying!!",A couple of hours in the museum
"January 5, 2023","Excellent museum for children. The different zones mean that you can pick and choose what you want to focus on. It was really busy when we went so the younger members of the group could get a bit overwhelmed at times but the exhibits were accessible, informative and enjoyable. We all learnt something from our visit!",Really good!
"September 5, 2020","With the social distancing had to book in advance to get a slot. Quite alot of exhibits closed or open but not fully,but to be expected. Social distancing was good generally. Such a great place to visit. The building is stunning from the outside and so interesting inside. The T-Rex is iconic to see when visiting! Some cafes and gift shops open. Really enjoyed",An enjoyable 2 hours
"June 1, 2023",Easy to book in advance and admission was straightforward despite being very busy. You have to expect it is going to be busy during school holidays but it was still possible to get close to things of interest. The young children in our group enjoyed the dinosaurs and the earthquake simulation. My main criticism is there are too many small gift shops and interactive sections. Too many models and not enough of the real artefacts. It’s free though so it is value for money!,Personal Favourite
"August 22, 2022","This is my personal must whenever I'm in London. It's free and fantastically curated. This time over, I went to see Dippy the diplodocus, which is ""back home"" from its tour, and had a walk down the dinosaur gallery.At the moment, tickets are free, but these days it's better to book them online.",Absolutely fabulous well worth a visit
"January 15, 2023",Absolutely fantastic what a brilliant way to spend the day kept the teens and the adults engaged. Free entry however you do need to book online. Really enjoyed the exhibits. The earth and volcano exhibit was great the escalator ride was a little hairy - very high for the faint hearted. So much information to take in and digest you need quite a few hours to see everything.  We stopped half way in the cafe for some lunch which was yum! There are other restaurants within the museum.,Perennial favourite
"August 26, 2022","We always enjoy coming here, despite the crowds. Lots of interesting things to see (especially the dinosaurs and the blue whale!) and a fun time for children and adults.We did not book tickets in advance and had to wait in line outside, as apparently capacity within the museum is capped. We came towards the end of the day, so luckily the line moved quickly.It is quite warm and crowded inside. It's a bit chaotic. Only some of the rooms are air-conditioned.Lots of maps around, so you can easily find what you want to see. Dippy, the famous dinosaur, is temporarily back before going on another UK tour.",Worth Visiting
"November 17, 2022",We had a wonderful visit here. Dippy was impressive and we were lucky there wasn’t a long queue.  Sophie was also well worth visiting.The missus liked the human evolution exhibit while I enjoyed the gift shop - ended up buying a few gifts.It is definitely worth spending a couple of hours here.,Very Busy Midweek 
"June 26, 2022","Very busy full of school kids (midweek in June) and not many maps to find your way around - £1 for a paper map.  We eventually found the dinosaur exhibit which was disappointing, a one way system round a room crammed full far too much info and not much exhibits, very busy and frustrating/hot.We then gave up and left as it wasn't a pleasant experience.No idea why we had to book tickets (free), stood outside and booked on phone and then someone glanced at it on the way in.I'm sure it would be better on a quieter day or if there was more room to allow people to walk more freely.",Must see.
"June 26, 2022","Amazing, profesional, and they had many professional exhibitions. It was easy to orient yourself and easy to get around, staff everywhere and of course free entry!!!!",A world-class museum
"June 24, 2022",We loved the Dinosaur skeletons which were very impressive. The museum is large with many incredible parts. We were very impressed with the geological part.,"""Gargantuan"""
"June 24, 2022","As a Jurassic Park addict, as soon as I entered the main hall of the museum. It just reminded me of a movie “Night at the museum” don't ask me why. It is a gargantuan museum that has a place to display skeletons of the most famous lived animal t-rex to the largest living animal whale. The museum has a vast range of fossils, also skeletons of dinosaurs and mammals. The mastodon skeleton is my favorite, which helped me connect with the movie Ice Age. Lots of stuffed animals to check out. There is a display of two giraffes where one is just the skeleton of a giraffe and the other is a stuffed one which looks real. Then there is an elephant family from big ones to small that is such a great site to watch. Other than the objects displayed, the architecture of a building itself is a fruitful site to visit. Overall a must visit place in London.",Reunion visit to London
"June 21, 2022","I only gave it 3 stars because it was impossible to see anything.  The museum has a dinosaur exhibit that seems to draw busloads of school children on the day we were there.  It meant that you could not get close to many of the exhibits and  created a very unenjoyable atmosphere.      Maybe I am too old but I prefer my museum to be informative rather than a Disney show,   In contrast the V&A across the street is excellent. ",A vast and interesting museum
"June 20, 2022","This is a beautiful building and a very vast museum full of information. I spent over 3 hours here and couldn’t get round everything. Lots of very informative sections on dinosaurs, mammals and much more. Staff were friendly.",Dont visit on a summer day - No air conditioning
"June 18, 2022","Hot Stuff Crowded.  No air conditioning rude staff and dated exhibitions.Went to see Dippy, what a disappointment!.  Had a ask at the information desk as to exactly where this famous dinosaur was located, as there was no signs anywhere.What a shock when finally located.  stuck in a side room, with multi coloured lights flashing on and off it.No where as re,emembered when it was in the main entrance hall.Museum not exactly disabled friendly steep steps everywhere inside.",Step back in time
"June 18, 2022","The museum is in need of a good cleaning.  Dusty exhibits everywhere, the price is right for admission (free).  The sections of the museum not related to minerals /rocks are worth while .  Unless a geologist avoid the rock section.  Kids will love the nature and dinosaur exhibits.",Really nice day out
"June 17, 2022",This is a really nice day trip for families and people visitong Lonfon. The entry is free but you can pay for some of the exhibits online. There is a lot to see and there are some interacrive parts for the kids. The museum is seperated into different sections. There are baby changing facilities and a few different bathrooms around. There is also a really nice cafe and a massive giftshop with a variety of thongs to choose from from soft toys to childrens toys and figures and stationary. ,Great visit
"June 15, 2022","Lovely museum lots to do, and suitable for all ages.  Will return soon.  It was great to see DIppy as I had not seen this before!",Something for everyone
"January 29, 2023","I visited this museum today with my family, including a young child. There was something that caught all of our interests during our visit. The dinosaur room was our favourite, especially the real life, moving t-rex.The escalator where you end up in the moon/ egg was really cool, we all enjoyed this. The earthquake stimulator was cool, soo much information and videos. I would recommend pre booking your free tickets, we managed to skip a long queue because of this.",Tooooo busy and dark
"February 20, 2023","Was absolutely packed. We had prebooked time slot but was toooo busy. 5 or 6 people deep at every exhibition. Also very badly lit , i know you want atmosphere but was too dark to see things, especially the dinosaurs which were also displayed far too high. Cafe areas overcrowded and uncleared tables . Various interactive stuff not working.  Left as my 7 year old was "" bored"".",Amazing place. Highly recommended 
"October 18, 2022",We went with our 10yo and 7yo girls. We all loved it. A great place for 3 to 4 hours at least. We didn't get round it all in the 4 hours we were there. It is free to enter. We booked online before but didn't need to. The exhibition to see Dippy also didn't need tickets when we were there. ,It’s ok
"February 17, 2022","It’s Alright, once you’ve seen one Dino bone you’ve seen them all. Once you’ve seen one flourite crystal, you’ve seen em all. The big blue Topaz was stunning and the Giant Sequoia are worth seeing.",Well organised but avoid weekends!
"May 7, 2022","I went to see the Wildlife Photographer of the Year  which was just outstanding.  I try and go every year if I am in London.  This is a paid exhibition.  I made the silly mistake of booking for a Saturday afternoon.  The museum was super busy!  If you can avoid it and don't have children, then go at a quieter time!  The exhibition was really well laid out and easy to follow. Clean.  Loved it.  Staff were  pleasant and friendly.  Despite them trying to manage numbers with the ongoing C-19 pandemic, it was still super busy!  ",Multiple visits
"November 11, 2022","We regularly visit this museum. It is for us the jewel in the crown. So much to see one visit is simply not enough. I first visited as a child, have visited many times as a parent and now visit just for my own pleasure. I have visited the NYC Natural History Museum which is hugely disappointing comparatively. If your in London it's the no.1 thing to do.",Well worth a visit
"April 8, 2023","Please do visit, it was a great experience, we stayed for 5 hours!Some of the exhebitions are a bit dull, relaying on plaster replicas of animals, where as others are great, especially the display of birds. A bit sad that the garden is not open at this time, as it is being remodelled, and I would have liked a gallery on plants, maybe there were some that we just missed. ",Spoilt by its own success.
"August 4, 2022","It's just too busy to enjoy, and we were there on a day with no queue to get in.Also the dinosaur exhibit is completely shut currently. Not much fun. I'd recommend the Science Museum next door as a much better alternative for kids or adults.",Wildlife Photographer of the Year
"May 15, 2023","We went for the Wildlife Photographer of the Year with an 11 year old. We thought it was very good but she was bored there was nothing that we could see the interacts with kids. We also spent time in the Dinosaur room, which was great. The photography we have been before a few years back and thought this time lacked a wow factor. I would say its good to go every few years The Dinosaur exhibition I personally would have liked to see more real fossils and not models.",Dinosnores 
"October 30, 2023",I attended dinosnores with my sister and best friend. I've been wanting to go for years and finally a big birthday gave me the excuse! It was a fantastic experience. The staff were great and clearly put a lot of effort into the night. A special mention to the compare who was great! The food was surprisingly good for a large catered event. We enjoyed the animal meet and great and the quiz. The best of all was getting to roam around the museum at night. The harpist was a lovely touch to finish off the night. It was great to spend a bit of time in the morning in the titanosaur exhibition and gift shop. I'd recommend getting there early and waiting outside. We were near the front of the queue and had first pick of sleeping area,Wow what a place.  Absolutely fantastic!!
"March 20, 2022","Went for the day and did the out of hours dino tour before general admission.  Our tour guide was fantastic and very knowlegable and we were the only ones in the museum.  We then explored and spent 7 hours in the museum.  It was absolutely brilliant and we feel privileged to have been to such a fantastic place.  Beautiful architecture, wonderful exhibits. Long may it continue and we will be back. ",Excellent day out 
"January 4, 2020","We visited The Natural History Museum yesterday. We queued for about 20 minutes to get in. It’s a very large place, with lots to see and do. There’s a lot of information on dinosaurs. There’s a lift up to the red zone where you can learn about earthquakes.There’s a creepy crawly section.",Fantastic
"February 10, 2020","Spent hours at the natural history museum, it was brilliant! So many interesting things to look at and learn about. The dinosaur section was really great. Lots of school trips there, but it didn’t interfere with our visit to much, just very noisy. Would definitely recommend a visit and it’s free o charge.",Excellent Museum
"July 7, 2021","The last time I went to the NHM was a school trip some 45ish years ago and it was superb. We had a great time and the dinosaurs and blue whale were my favourite. Very busy with lots of children with their families despite it being school term which was surprising, remember you need to book.",Brilliant
"October 4, 2021",It’s free!!! I’m not sure what people are meaning about. I was heart broken when I realised I forgot to book and my son was sooooo upset. After looking online again we took the risk to tube it and walk ( as the nearest station was closed ) 😤 and we were not disappointed.  We walked straight in. The staff were amazing they sang happy birthday to my daughter and my son and I go is dinosaur mad was proper made up. Much made my day. It’s free so enjoy it for what it is.,Brilliant
"February 9, 2020",Went with family today. So much to see and learn for the children but also learn ourselves.Favourite part has to be the dinosaur exhibit for us but everything was still great to see too.Restaurant is slightly pricey but we took our own lunch.. Definitely worth the trip,My favourite museum 
"March 8, 2020","The national history museum is my favourite museum ever! It's such a gorgeous building from the exterior but the interior blows you away. The museum is filled with so much history, it's such a delight. Plus the fact it's free means you can have an exciting day out for literally NOTHING. I highly recommend this place if and when travelling to London. Seek the excitement in this stunning museum. ",Very confusing layout
"January 17, 2023","Signs need rethinking especially if your not coming in from the main entrance,  the zones (colour) don’t really match with what the signs say and the toilets are nowhere near where the signs say.  Even the staff where confused.  A lot of walking around on tired feet and getting annoyed.  Spoilt the experience.  What we did see we enjoyed though.  ",Best Museum Ever!!!
"January 21, 2020","This is the best museum I’ve ever been to! It’s free, we paid £2/coat in the cloakroom. £1 for kids. £5 for a kids book which we used as a map. Use the cloakroom because we spent 5 hours in this amazing place, could’ve spent 6. Fantastic for kids!!",So much to see
"July 14, 2022","We only had a couple of hours to spare, but just going in to see the building itself is worth it! Amazing details built in.  We just had a quick walk round to see Dippy again, 48 years since I last saw him at the museum. We looked at the minerals room to see the cabinets as they were in the museum back in the 1800’s.  Who knew there were so many different ones and the Vault had some amazing contents. We could spend a day there no problem if it was nearer for us to get there.",Still a brilliant museum but too crowded for me
"March 26, 2023",First visit to the museum since 2015.  My son is 13 now and still loved it.  Plenty to keep us both interested and the staff were friendly and helpful.  Only downside is how crowded it was.  It made it difficult to see the exhibits.  Kids having meltdowns everywhere.  Not sure if it’s a post covid thing but I don’t like that level of busy anymore.,Cant thank the staff enough 
"March 5, 2020",I cant thank the staff enough for how they treated my family and especially my youngest daughter when we visited in the half term holiday. Lovely place filled with lovely staff who cant do enough for you. Absolutely amazing dinosaur gallery. The downstairs area for the younger children is brilliant too. Would highly recommend a visit. ,Not good
"August 25, 2022","Really disappointed with our trip. Too many people, too hot and no obvious route around. The map (£1) is very unhelpful and I was upset that it now appears to be ok again to show stuffed birds if it’s showing how the Victorians used to do it.",FREE to get in !
"February 4, 2022","Free to get in, they do advise to book your tickets online though, but these are still Free. Easy to get too on the tube. Massive place ! Lots to see ! Choice of various cafes onsite ! Staff informative & helpful, really clean place.",Great visit
"January 11, 2022","Great visit.First time visitor but will be back.Great exhibits and plenty to see.Easily accessible with booked tickets, lovely team members and a great way to spend a few hours.",Great Museum 
"July 15, 2022",A worthwhile visit to the museum. Lots too do for the kids and I found it fascinating. Didn't try the coffee shop but looked nice and was always busy. 2 Mon walk from South Kennington tube station. Lots of places en route to grab breakfast ,Sort the wildlife area out its a shambles
"September 16, 2021","Good place and a must do. The wildlife garden is a massive letdown, almost derelict,  ponds empty so no way for wildlife to exisit. This area lets the whole place down its a shambles. ",Shame not alot to do 
"August 12, 2020","Been many times and loved it, however and only because of covid this time sucked, understandable a lot is closed due to covid and everything else seems rushed. Its hard to social distance, especially the dinosaur and its very small now to view it as the raised platform is not in use. At the moment I would give it a miss just because I know how fun and good it can be, that's not take anything away from the staff who clearly have worked very hard to even get it to this stage, I will come back but when hopefully things are more settled ",Outstanding pictures
"July 7, 2023",Went to the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition. Outstanding photography by children and adults in some unusual situations. Each backlit photo was accompanied by the name land country of residence of the photographer together with details of the camera and settings used as well as information on the actual picture. Well displayed  and extremely interesting,Wish the dinosaur had taken some adults for lunch.
"July 19, 2021",They need to work out a way to have adults only times. The whole place was like a giant crèche. I dread to think what it will be like over the 6 weeks summer holiday. I have no problem with kids needing to learn but there was no learning going on. Mums were mostly on the phone.,Microbes to mammoths...prepare to be amazed!
"August 1, 2016","A wondrous place filled with....just about everything. Spectacular exhibits everywhere you look. Microbes, mammoths, dinosaurs, lava and much, much, much more!One day isn't enough to see everything this great building had to offer, so we went back for a second day!Pros: free, spectacular insight into the world's history, something for all ages, amazing exhibits.Cons: cafe was expensive, needs more staff to assist in answering questions (out 7 year old had lots and lots of unanswered questions)Perfect place to visit on a rainy day.",Cannot get in for the queues of children!
"November 16, 2014","I got as far as the queue this time, but gave up.  Sorry, but as a Londoner I feel really fed up that I can no longer visit my favourite museum because the numbers of school parties, tourists, or in the holidays just vast numbers of families make it impossible to enjoy – the queues and the noise are horrendous.  I absolutely agree that children need to visit this place, and it's great that it's free for them, but why can't we have just one day a week for grown ups, or perhaps for Londoners only – I am sure many old fogies like me would be happy to pay for this and it might help the museum to make some money if people knew they could get in and walk around in relative peace to enjoy the wonderful exhibits.",Ideal day out for a two year old
"October 31, 2012",We took our two year old grandson for a leisurely visit to the museum. We allowed him to wander and look at what he liked and what interested him which meant we ended up spending a good hour in the Dinosaur Section. It could be described as potentially frightening for a younger child but his enthusiasm overcame any fear. We went outside the school holidays and did not find the venue crowded. Children see lots of animals on TV or asleep in Zoo's but he was able to get a real idea of the size of the various animals close up. He was too young to read and go into any depth with the exhibits but the lay out and way things were exhibited allowed him to view things from his own perspective. He was talking about the experience for days. There is a very nice restaurant and coffee shop and you can also do as we did and take your own food. Well worth a visit and a place you can return to again and again. Something of interest for everyone.,We're coming back for a full tour!
"October 23, 2023",I think I took around 400 pictures in only 2 hours... Such a beautiful museum to visit. A must-see in London!,Loved it! 
"August 31, 2020",It's a must to visit this museum! We had a wonderful time here. You learn a lot and there are many attractions. It's better to plan at least half-day to visit it entirely. ,很大
"March 25, 2020",坐地鐵前往很方便，而且博物館是免費。附近還有Victoria and Albert Museum及Science Museum，也是免費的。博物館所恐龍館非常吸引。門口的藍鯨也非常震撼。,"in 1974/5, my first travel to GB accompanied by my English teacher...."
"August 15, 2016","I finished my school in 1974/75 and I asked my English teacher to accompany me for a travel to London and to Great Britain, to NY City and all over the USA.In 1974/75 we visited London and we travelled in my car all over Great Britain. It was a phantastic experience to be accompanied by my very beautiful English teacher and we enjoyed the trip to GB and to the U.S.After these common trips she married and became a mother of two kids; I began my studies of engineering and business administration at a Technical University in Ger- many. because she had married we lost out of sight. Some 15 years later we accidentally met and liked to rember our phantastic travels all over Great Britain and all over the USA.We visited many interesting places in London, and I can really recommend you to visit this museum . If you're interested in history, this visit is a 'Must'! You won't regret it.I have been several times in London and in GB, in NY City and all over the USA after my first travels into the English speaking world accompanied by my (former) English teacher.Whenever I have been in GB or in the USA I like to remember my our travels with beautiful (former) English teacher!",Great place for people of all ages
"October 2, 2015",- A must-visit in London- Great collection of specimen and models- Its really huge and takes at least 2-3 hours to see the entire place- Can get crowded on weekends- Great place for kids,BEWARE There is no members room at present
"February 19, 2015","The museum has some great exhibits but........We live outside London, so a members' room is a real benefit of membership.Currently there is no members' room and no date for a new members' room.Filling in a complaint form about the lack of a members' room resulted in ............ no contact at all from the Museum.  Which just made me that bit crosser.",No T-Rex skeleton
"May 13, 2012","Was hoping to see an actual T-Rex skeleton and not an animatronics T-Rex, although it was amusing.  The line for the dinosaurs looked long, but moved pretty quickly.  Beautiful building and LOTS of screaming kids.",It’s okay
"January 13, 2022",Another good day out I loved the gems stones i could have spent all day in there looking at the different stones and crystals.  It’s another big museum make sure you give your sled plenty of time to go round it. I would say go to the entrance with all the dinosaurs first because that’s the best bit. We went through the other entrance where there’s staff pressuring you into paying a donation. I understand that times are tough but not everyone can afford a donation £5 or £10 can go a long way to quite a lot of people. I understand that you need donations to keep the place running but please don’t pressure people into it. I was annoyed at the fact that you are happy to take my money off me when i walk through the door but as soon as I want a bottle of water and hand you over a Scottish note you screw your face up and say your not accepting it. When the last time I checked Scotland is apart of the UK but you won’t accept it but your happy to take money off me as soon as I walk through the door. ,Dino Snores - Amazing experience
"January 12, 2022","A small group of us went to the NHM for an adult DinoSnores event - it was amazing and would recommend to others.The event starts around 6.30pm and you leave by 9.30am, during the event there is a 3 course meal, quizzes, talks, films, pop up bar and breakfast.Some of the exhibitions are open including the Dinosaurs and Wildlife Photographer of the year .For the whole event there are up to 300 people, which means that as you go around there is so much space to view things (only about 10 people in the Photography exhibition).A yoga mat is provided, you bring your own sleeping bag and get to sleep under Hope the Whale (although don't expect much sleep!)There were plenty of staff on duty to help find your way around (and serve drinks)A fabulous experience, one I feel quite privileged to have been able to attend.",Great visit
"January 11, 2022","Great visit.First time visitor but will be back.Great exhibits and plenty to see.Easily accessible with booked tickets, lovely team members and a great way to spend a few hours.",Dinosnores for Grown Ups
"January 10, 2022","Dinosnores for grownups was a truly excellent event.  We could camp anywhere in the massive Hintze Hall, including upstairs in the galleries, so there was plenty of space for all participants.  The event was run in a very covid-secure way and felt well-organised.  The ticket price included all activities, a drink on arrival, tea and coffee, a really good quality three-course meal and a hearty breakfast to send us on our way.  We were spoilt for choice with the activities, with particular highlights being meeting geckos, spiders and snakes up close, crafting and pub quizzes.  I was pleasantly surprised that we could roam around many of the galleries and exhibits as well.  No wonder we didn’t bother turning in before the lights were dimmed at 3am!",Just a museum.
"January 6, 2022",Average as far as museums go.Was a fun time looking at the dinosaur exhibit. Fair few things in this museum just don’t work due to covid and the interactivity is at a minimum.Fun for educating the younger generation though.Probably wouldn’t go back.,Dangerous Ice Skating Rink
"January 4, 2022","I ice skate regularly at our local rink in Chelmsford and my friend and I booked this session as a bit of winter fun. I use the public skates at my local rink so this isn’t me just being snooty about not having good enough skates, but the skates were not sharp at all. This meant you couldn’t cut into the ice making it so slippy and dangerous!! They have a responsibility to their customers and they are falling short. The ice wasn’t also Oreo perky maintained so I saw a lot of falls. Don’t go here. Go to summerset house instead as that is better run and maintained","Dino Snores for kids , NOT worth the money"
"January 3, 2022","We visited Dino snores for kids event in decemeber.  We paid around £60 per peron including tickets but the activities done during dino snores were really disappointing. Event was crowded and chaotic.Gates open at 6.30pm but by the time we went in it was nearly 7.45pm, there were only 3 staff to check 100's of guests.Except T-shirt making other activities were not really interesting to kids who had been to these museums many times but were attending dinosnore for first time.You can do most of these activites during day time in the museum for free, sleeping experience wasn't nice.There were 4 activities in total, three in the night and one in the morning which you do on your own.1. Visiting Fantastic beasts portraits around the museum with an activity sheet.2. Making Dinosaur tshirt (you use a coloring pen to draw on a white T-shirt).3. Night trail, we expected more from this, you just go around the museum to find a name about a dinosaur and the instructor was bit boring , it was late, many kids fell asleep.3.  In morning, you will get another activity sheet which you do on your own.Sleeping-Sleeping experience wasn't great, they give you thin mats. There was social distancing here.  Breakfast was not great , one pastry and orange juice , there was no fruit inside our bag.I was intrigued as to why it is booked out but couldn't find any decent review , after reading this I hope you make your decision wisely.Overall it's not worth the money. DO IT during day time for free",Very good
"January 3, 2022","Been twice. Both times enjoyed. There are many sections, obviously some will be more interesting to some people than others. It will take most the day to go round. Very nice cafe. Some areas get very busy.",Terrifying
"January 1, 2022","We visited the ice rink on New Year’s Eve and really wish we hadn’t! Would suggest because of the mild weather the ice was melting and there was two inches of standing water on the rink, it was too dangerous. I was knocked over backwards by a tall bloke who’d been weaving in and out precariously of other skaters throughout the session. I hit my head and momentarily blacked out. My 12 year old daughter had to call over staff, one of whom said it wasn’t his job to help. When I was finally helped off the ice was seen by a grumpy first aider who seemed more intent on telling off my traumatised daughter for wanting to be with me than in carrying out a proper check over. She checked me for concussion, made me sign a piece of paper and gave me some paracetamol and sent me on my way, totally missing the bleeding gash on the back of my head despite me telling her my head hurt. Poor organisation, poorly trained staff, who all seemed too young to deal with a crisis and poor management to keep the rink open when others had closed because of the weather. Thankfully I was just a walking wounded but dread to think how they would have reacted to a serious injury!",Do not go at weekend
"December 29, 2021",Very interesting place with many treasures but trying to study or contemplate the exhibits is nigh on impossible when surrounded by children with parents trying to noisily explain the relevance of the items. Yes I too had children and appreciate the problems. All I suggest if you are not going with a young family do visit out of holiday times and weekends. By the way the cost of food here is considerable for second rate items. Our something and cranberry sandwich had a tiny pink stain which I guess was meant to be the cranberry content.,"If you are over 15, it is absolute rubbish"
"October 4, 2010","I went to this museum yesterday, and I was so disappointed. All I saw was lots of animal models, and dinosaur models. There are very few real animals there, and those are birds mainly. The greatest disappointment was when I entered the other two museums; I spent 4 and half hours in it and saw almost nothing real, just games and videos and pictures for children; and there lies the extraordinary science and V&A museums. So, my advice is spend your time in the others, just give 30 minutes to this museum for the earth's treasury, they have all kinds of rocks in it, and it is worth to see and another 30 minutes to zoology spirit building if you have interest in historical collection of animals in jars, skip the cocoon and whatever you do, do not enter the dinosaur chamber, unless you want to spend at leats 40 minutes in the queue just to see 2 dino fossils a few plastic models and a plastic model t-rex roaring. It is for only children and adults that have lower IQ than an average child.",Dino Snores
"July 17, 2010","Fantastic !!!!Spend the night at the museum.I went in a group of 5 8 yr old kids and 2 adults - what a great night.The kids loved it.We had lots to do and loved all of it.Adults - don't expect to get any sleep, especially if there's a male adult snoring like a walrus all night echoing through the main hall and 500 kids giggling but it was fantastic all the same. Brilliant fun and great team leaders and presenters. I imagined stuffy museum types, they aren't. Very entertaining and worth the 45 quid per child. Will book again.",Shockingly awful museum !
"November 9, 2019","No words can begin to describe how disgusted i am with the service this museum has provided (or not provided!) today. Over £100 spent on tickets down the drain as apparently due to 'technical problems' our tickets were booked for another day. We were then faced with the fact that we weren't allowed in as the space was full which we knew it wasn't, as groups in front of us were being told to buy tickets that day! Then we were rudely told that we could not even have a refund. Along with all this we were accompanied by dear friends who had travelled over 200 miles to see the exhibition for a birthday. JACK EVANS the so called 'manager' was called down to talk to us. He was the rudest, foulest, most inexperienced manager i have ever spoken to. The way he dealt with the situation was appalling and i strongly advise his job to be reviewed as if it was me i wouldn't dare employ such a disgustingly vile man. So, in summary the natural history museum is not somewhere i will be returning to until a whole new team of staff are employed and i will be telling all the family and friends to steer very clear from this disaster of a museum!",Many things to see here
"August 1, 2019","There are many things to see in this place. After you finish seeing guard change at the palace, you can walk to this museum or take the tube here. It is free entry but you can donate for them. It is really interesting place. I am sure if you like this kind of stuff, you must visit this place. There are restaurant and shops that you can buy souvenir also. ",Love it
"June 1, 2019","When you come to London you have to visit the Natural History Museum. I visited it twice, I love it. Probably, I will visit it again😊The entrance is free, you have to pay  only for special exhibitions. Of course, if you want, you can make a donation, 5 pounds is ok. The opening hour is 10, usualy you have to wait to enter, 10-15 minutes. The museum is very well organised, the building itself is a work of art. ",A strange feeling 
"May 21, 2019","So the natural history museum is a beautiful building. But the inside well I think it’s great for children but a lot of replicas and the things that actually are real are covered in dust and not taking cared of, and very old posters. The best part was a performance one on the rooms. ",First time visit
"November 19, 2016","Neither of us had been to this Museum before and were greatly looking forward to it, sadly we were a little disappointed about some aspects of it.We entered via the exhibition Road entrance, which may have been a mistake. Bags checked we progressed to the admissions desk where it was noted there were two of us and we were told that while admission was free there was a suggested donation of £5. In these circumstances we usually will give a donation (more often than not, larger than any suggested one) on exiting the venue. We explained this and were waved on with a smile. Next, a few feet away, we encountered two donations boxes, the way forward between them blocked by a member of staff, who repeated the donation line quite forcefully. This person only reluctantly got out of the way once we had explained again our wish to delay any donation until the end of our visit. It seems that this suggested donation is seen as compulsory by some. Having entered we encountered the escalator entrance to the volcano display, spectacular, but we made the error of going straight up it. We had not realised we had no way through from these levels to the rest of the museum, we rapidly got very lost. We had not been offered a map of the museum on entrance and found only one member of staff, a cleaner, who was very helpful and guided us back to where we could collect a folded map of the type usually given on admission to National museums, they were £1 here. We picked one up and then could find our way round the fascinating displays in what is a stunning building. Highlights for us were the dinosaur and Blue whale galleries, Dippy is an interesting cast, as are a surprising number of the dinosaur skeletons, something we were quite disappointed with. We could understand a few to add balance to the types displayed of course, but there did seem to be an awful lot of them, do we really have such a paucity of real specimens in the national collection? The human display was fascinating, as was the insect and the darwin centre. The Gems was a very traditional but interesting display, the treasury was fascinating, I never knew gold had been found in more than microscopic quantities in the UK before.Apart from the admissions staff the rest of the staff we encountered were very helpful and friendly. A bonus is the availability of free WiFi, which meant my wife could post a film of the animated Trex on facebook, saying it reminded her of her mother.In the end although disappointed in the almost desperation to extract money out of visitors at times (admission is free but as UK taxpayers we already contribute) we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and yes we did leave a donation.",Security guard ruined what could of been a great day
"June 21, 2016","On walking in to museum there was a table for bags to be searched on entry. There were two members of security team carrying out checks, after waiting by the table for approx 1 minute and being ignored I assumed it was only selected people's bags that were being searched so decided to walk on, at this point I was shouted at ""where do u think you are going"" I said ""I'm sorry didn't realise u wanted to search my bag, I will come back"" to which the security guard in question replied ""yeah u better had"" I then opened by bag for him to look inside feeling really embarrassed and deflated that a trip I had been really looking forward to wasn't off to a great start. He was so rude while checking through my bag and treated me with such contempt that as soon as my bag search was over I walked into the museum and burst out crying. Something that should have been a very small part of my day ended up leaving me feeling really small and foolish for the rest of the day. I really hope no1 else has the same experience I did.",not impressed
"October 7, 2014",I should have known that I would not enjoy this museum when I had to submit to my bags being searched before I was allowed to enter! This ridiculous policy caused queues standing in the rain and as I had my luggage at the end of a holiday I was incredibly embarrassed about some person going through my laundry. The cloakroom prices were extortionate and I had to drag my bags around with me. Needless to say my stay was short and I am in no hurry to go back.,Appalling food in the restaurant
"September 16, 2014","We took our grown up kids for a birthday treat yesterday to the Natural History Museum. We thought we would have a treat and have lunch in this magnificent building. We should have realised something was afoot when we saw how completely empty the restaurant was at lunchtime. Maybe 2 other families and a wee mouse running around. I ordered a hotdog with chips for the birthday boy who was starving as he had not had breakfast, 2 veggie burgers and chips and a side salad of coleslaw and a caesar salad, plus 2 soft drinks this totaled over £40. We have never been a family to leave food - EVER - (and we were all very hungry) but this meal was so bland and stale tasting that we couldn't eat it. The caesar salad was a bit of little gem lettuce with tasteless dressing, croutons and a few ultra salty dark anchovies lurking in there. Nothing else .. for £8 .. no art to it remotely. We had had this salad in pubs in London lots before and it was fabulous and had extra nice bits like rocket, roasted pinenuts and shavings of Parmesan. The hotdog was bland and dry and with a few crispy bits of onion on top not butter and a huge amount of low-grade bread. The veggie burgers almost had no taste at all, I think they were made from tinned beans and were dry with a massive pappy bap enclosing it. It said it came with hummus but we opened it up and saw a tiny tiny trace of something beige that was probably suppose to be the hummus. We certainly couldn't taste it. How could food be so utterly tasteless I think you would have to work extra hard to do that. The coleslaw was not fresh and it was acrid and watery, I found it actually repulsive. None of the dressings tasted like mayonnaise. When the waiter asked how our food was nobody wanted me to complain but we were sitting there with most of it uneaten so I said it was the worst meal I had ever had out and it was such a disappointment to come up from Bristol and this was our food treat for the day out! We are not wealthy, we eat out maybe once every few years. I said to the waiter that the chef needs to be sacked as he clearly has no love of food and must have no taste buds ( ... or she?) They offered no apologies - in fact the waiter said that that was the ingredients for a Caesar salad. It might have been the basic, bog standard ingredients but food is also an art form and maybe the Natural History Museum's restaurant would be full if they approached food like they do in the V&A - where we thankfully took ourselves and had a lovely pot of tea and very good cakes!",Out of this World
"October 5, 2018",What an experience. The Natural History Museum is free entry and well worth a visit if you are in London. I was dragged here by my husband who has a keen interest in science and even I enjoyed my time here. We were there on a busy morning and were still able to move around freely. The dinosaur and rock exhibit is a must see. ,Meh.
"September 27, 2018",Millions of exhibits packed off in some warehouse to make room for interactive displays for children and plastic dinosaurs. Dumbed down natural history. The only room worth visiting is the one with minerals and gems. That's it.,Disappointed in the museum
"September 13, 2018","We are from NYC area and maybe we are spoiled but we were extremely disappointed. My 13 yea old just wanted to see the Dinosaurs and he walked thru saying, that's wrong, they didn't live together, etc etc. On a positive note the architecture of the building is gorgeous and it is free. Little kids may like it but it's crowded and not interested as other museums, go to the science museum it was better.",Very good source of information for science students.
"September 12, 2018","My teens they really enjoyed our visit here. A lot to do and learn. If you have time, you can spend a full day here. It is a must to mention, the architecture of this building is impressive, both from the out side and the inside. Wow!",World-class museum
"July 15, 2018","One of our favorite stops when in London.  Amazing breadth of collections, the mineral collection is amazing.",Brilliant place but busy
"July 15, 2018",This is accessible from the tube station by subway which is very handy. The building is stunning inside and outside.  The attraction is free with a suggested donation of £5 but it's worth more and there are donation points in the main hall.The dinosaur exhibition was excellent if a little packed.  The mammal section is good and the views from the upper gallery are good. There is huge section on minerals and ores which didn't interest me but the cabinets in the room were beautiful. I'm sure if you were interested in minerals this would be a fantastic place.We arrived around 12 pm and only had a very short queue.There are a few seats and a coffee shop which was perfect for us as one member of our group was tired.,"Nice museum, very busy on the weekends!"
"July 15, 2018","Beautiful museum, but it does get very busy on the weekend with huge line ups. The line does move relatively quickly. There were a lot of people visiting on the Sunday I was there, would recommend a weekday to avoid the huge crowds.",Movie Night at the museum - don't bother!
"February 12, 2018","My daughter and i thought ET in the Hintze Hall would be fun but it wasn't.Long queues to get in, long queues to get drinks or snacks so we didn't bother, and after we spent some time in the Dinosaur gallery ( the only other gallery available wasn't open when we arrived) we found another (yes you've guessed it) long queue to get into the Hall. It was so cold in here that we kept coats, scarves and gloves on all evening. The sound quality was terrible as the voices just echoed round the hall.I love the NHM but please, lets have a better organised evening, and i think a complimentary drink with a £28 ticket wouldn't be unreasonable. This is a total ripoff.","Really terrible, what a disappointment "
"August 7, 2017","I last visited the museum around 20 years ago as a teenager and thought it was fantastic, so I was really looking forward to returning and taking our young son with us. However it was so disappointing. First when we arrived we walked to the main entrance and got virtually all the way there before seeing a sign saying that the main entrance was closed and we needed to walk all the way back we'd came to a side entrance. We then found the queue to get in. It took about 20 minutes to get in so it wasn't too bad. When we got in we were ushered towards an information desk. We wanted to go to the whale exhibit so I asked about this and the girl on the desk sold me the tickets for this. The charge for the three of us (2 adults and 1 child) was £37.50, which seemed steep but I was optimistic it would be a good exhibit.We then walked into the museum and tried to find the whale exhibit. There was no sign posting for it anywhere!  We had no idea where to go. Eventually we headed for the mammal zone,assuming it would be there. We followed the signs, which pointed upstairs. So we took the escalator only to find that the next sign said the mammal zone was downstairs!  So we went back downstairs and ended up back where we started. We ended up just wandering around and only found the exhibit by chance!Then, despite already having tickets we had to queue behind people who didn't have tickets. However while we were queuing we saw the price list for the exhibit and saw that a family ticket was £32 - quite a bit less than we were charged! We asked about this when we got to the front of the queue and were told it was because we'd bought individual tickets and had paid a ""voluntary"" contribution on top. I pointed out that we'd not been told a family ticket would be better value and nothing had been said about a ""voluntary"" contribution. They were apologetic and said they could arrange a refund for the difference but they weren't authorised to do this and they'd have to call a manager.  So I waited for about 15 minutes for a manager to come only for one to then phone and say he couldn't come and I needed to go to him!Anyway we eventually got into the whale exhibit, we worked our way through what we assumed was the first of a number of rooms. It was mainly basic displays of information on the wall, with a few exhibits to look at and a couple of short videos. We then turned the corner and found ourselves in a shop selling whale memoralbelia. Obviously the shop is always at the exit, so both myself and my partner looked at each other and thought ""is that it?"". It had taken less than 10 minutes to see an exhibit that cost nearly £40 to go into. We even went back in case we had missed another room, but we hadn't.  It was so disappointing, it wasn't anything special, no different to the style of the free exhibits. We expected as a paid exhibit it would be much more extensive,  creative, interactive and high tech. We felt completely ripped off.Next, more signposting issues- our son needed the toilet, we followed the signs only to be sent round in circles again. It took nearly 15 minutes to find the toilets and we thought our son might have an accident. We then decided to go to the mammal room because it was something I remembered as a highlight when I last visited.  What I hadn't expected however was for it to have not changed one iota in the last two decades! It was so dated and all the exhibits were covered in a thick layer of dust. The dust was so bad that some people had written their names in it!In addition they simply let too many people in. We expected it to be busy, but it was ridiculous. You either could barely move or you were swept along in a tide of people. It was really unpleasant. So much so that even our six year old asked to leave after only an hour and a half there (most of it lost!).Then came the final challenge - finding the exit. Again we followed the signs and were sent round in circles.  It took 20 minutes to find the way out!I can't believe how bad the museum is now. I don't understand the positive reviews. There were large numbers of overseas tourists visiting and I was embarrassed that this is allegedly one of this country's foremost museums. They really need to seriously sort this place out.",A must for budding young naturalists...
"July 6, 2017","Having loved this place since my first visit on a school trip a few (many) moons ago I thought it about time to take my youngest niece and two nephews (one of whom is naturally dinosaur mad) to go and meet old Dippy.   We queued for about 30 mins but thankfully it wasn’t too hot a day.  The happy memories came flooding back upon entering when I saw old dippy in the main hall (Hintze?) which were then shattered when I discovered she is to be removed (no doubt so they can hold corporate parties)!  Nonetheless the little ones were suitably impressed.  Many of the exhibits have not changed since I visited as a child.  Some of the interactive displays in the marine mammal area, for instance, are in dire need of updating or, in most cases, repair.  The animatronic dinosaur was a highlight of the trip for the children.   However, as an adult corralling the children, who naturally want to explore, is made difficult by the crowds of people.  Though it was only a moderately hot day outside, indoors the heat was stifling and very uncomfortable in some places with the use of portable fans merely helping the hot air to circulate. To this working man’s eyes the coffee shop and restaurant were overpriced (though, perhaps average for London?).   £4.20 for a slice of cake: that is more expensive than a Happy Meal (two in fact, and probably about as nutritious). Luckily I had packed several bottles of water to keep my monsters hydrated and plenty of raisins, fruit snacks and sweets to keep them energised. The main gift shop by the entrance is well stocked and sells a variety of educational and not so educational books, toys, mementos, cuddly toys, &c with prices to suit (almost) all pockets.  The trip was, however, a hit and we left happy, exhausted and burdened with three large carrier bags worth of goodies.  Great for kids who want to know more about the natural world (rather than being cajoled) and the fact that it is free should encourage more to visit (shame about how they put down old Dippy though).",Last museum visit before 2nd lockdown 3.11.20
"November 5, 2020","Booked a slot for Tuesday 3rd November,ahead of the 2nd lockdown!I used to visit with my children,it was great to be alone and see the things I wanted to see!Spent 4 hours in total,very interesting.",Free day out 
"October 28, 2020",Second time I’ve been but first for my partner..loved it the second time as much as first time.its a fascinating museum ,Good time
"October 24, 2020",Very good museum Love all about  themAlot to see ij day out in London It free to go just need to go to queueVery interesting  ,Very nice
"September 23, 2020","We loved this museum, we wished we had brought our children and we will come back with them soon because it is really beautiful",A must see in London
"September 16, 2020","If you love nature and if you love history, it is nearly impossible, not to like this place. From rocks formation to insects animals and human evolutionary history, and yes Dinosaurs 🦕 you can find everything.... ",Busy
"September 13, 2020",Surprisingly or perhaps not as free tickets but quite busy. Didnt have the time to stay long but would be good if have a free day. Quite busy especially the dinos,Hm not enough seats
"September 7, 2020",Thanks to covid-19  not enough  seats to sit and stare at the dinosaur also food is not cheap for families ,Love this museum and the dinosaurs
"August 31, 2020","This museum is fantastic, from the awesome dinosaur exhibition, the somewhat old and a bit tatty mammals which are older than my grandparents but still retain their charm and all of the wonderful exhibits.",Must visit
"August 18, 2020","Great. Would visit it again. Stuffed animals, big dinosaurs, stones, simulation of earthquake, vulcanos etc..free and would recommend.",Recommend for family
"August 12, 2020","Recommend to visit dinosaur zone, kids may love it. The date we visit some of the zone were still closed but surely it will be interesting. ",Good way to spend an afternoon
"June 17, 2015","The Natural History Museum is in a beautiful building, and there is a good variety of exhibits. It can get fairly crowded on the lower level, but there are plenty of great things to see upstairs where it is not so busy. Another great thing about this place is that it is FREE!! So you can split your time between this museum and the Science and Tech museum next door, which is also FREE!",Make sure you pre-book the tickets for the dinosaurs gallery online
"April 11, 2015","We were attracted to visit this museum because of the dinosaurs exhibition; and not surprisingly, there was long queue to get into the dinosaur gallery. Luckily we pre-booked the tickets online via the museum's website and just turned up at the time beating the queue. That was the best decision I made, considering the queue is at least an hour long.we only had time to visit Blue zone (dinosaurs, sea life, other animals etc) and it was well worth the time spent.  It is free to enter - as in most museums in the UK.",Queues
"January 26, 2015","|We visited on Saturday and had to queue, although some visitors just by-passed the bored looking control staff and walked right in. This museum is geared for school groups and children or families with very  young children, definitely not for adults interested in natural history. We had to queue for what seemed everything, including the dinosaur section. Queueing 40 minutes so that we could pass the mechanical T Rex which I had not the slightest interest in - and look at a few artefacts is not worth your time! If we weren't standing in queues we were being knocked around by running children, hit by pushchairs or shunted by impatient people wanting get past! The architecture is amazing but it is let down by a poorly designed infrastructure. It would be far better if there it was opened up, like most museums are and one could walk around in relative peace and enjoy the exhibits, a bit like the British Museum...",Dinosnores for Grown Ups
"January 24, 2015","A Night at the Museum! If you ever get the opportunity then go; it is a night to never forget. With Naughty Science Talks, Dino-Dinner Quiz, drinks and bug tasting, live stand-up comedy (Helen Arney singing The Elements Song) and this all ends with the coolest sleepover ever taking place beneath the fossilized skeleton of the Diplodocus that graces Hintze Hall of the Museum. Drifting off to sleep with a harpist playing music including the theme tune to Jurassic Park and waking up to the sun coming through the panels of the stained glass windows.A mention has to go to the staff - Sally and her team including security were the best ever, from the moment we first walked in they made it extra special.",Love this place
"December 5, 2014",Lot's do and lot's to see and the price is totally free!! Beat that in London! ! A must see is the Dinosaur exhibition it is truly amazing you could easily spend a whole day on just this! ,Ok
"October 31, 2014",Visited the museum during October half term...never again it was far to busy I would recommend for you to pre book your dinosaur tickets  online before you attend saves you over 1 hour of queuing time you just go to the front of the queue if you are interested in museum it's a good day and plenty to see..,Chaotic 
"October 30, 2014",Half term I know but 30 mins to get in and then over a hour to get in the dinosaur section. People sitting down wherever they could and inability to get round the exhibits caused us to quit within 15 mins. Also £2 for a standard can of coke is offensive. Badly needs some better organisation when busy and financial reality on the food front ,Dusty and old
"September 30, 2014",Huge queues which was expected but when we got inside were very disappointed.Free entry unless you wanted to see the new feature of a mammoth was a joke.The mammals were very dusty and old looking.Only enjoyable part was the dinosaurs,No Dinosaurs :(
"September 16, 2014",Specifically went to London to show our son the dinosaurs and was horrified to find out that they were closed.Would not have gone to London had we known. Having said that it is free and still an amazing museum to visit. Very clean and lots of exhibits to keep everyone entertained.Just hope the dinosaurs come back soon!,Looks tired.  London can do better than this
"August 20, 2014","I was really underwhelmed by our visit to the Nat His museum. We went on a Saturday in August so hesitate was mega busy.  The crowds just weren't managed well and the whole place was hot and airless.  We'd pre booked tickets for the Dinosaurs but still we're corralled along the walk way to see a stagnant model of a T-Rex. The thing that disappointed me most was that apart from the Red zone (earthquakes and volcanoes) the exhibits were tired and lots of the interactive stuff (especially in the creepy crawlies section) was broken.  It just needs updating and better infrastructure management.  Toilets were also poor and not clean.Having been to the Smithsonian museum of Nat History in Washington DC, London was a very poor relation.",Wonderful! Just need more crowd control in some areas
"August 19, 2021",Beautiful building with loads to see and learn! A great time had by all! Seeing our dinosaur mad sons face light up was just such a beautiful thing. We loved it! My only negative point is that the dinosaur part and mammals should have been better controlled especially at the moment. It was very over crowded and that made me feel very uneasy. People pushing past and ontop of eachotherThe rest was absolutely fine,Wonderful Day Out
"August 19, 2021","The kids loved it.  The T Rex should not be missed.Was clean and tidy, helpful map and friendly staff on hand.  Very nice to be able to explore at your own pace and not be rushed.  Cafe was expensive @ £2.30 for a can of coke so best take a packed lunch.  Good to get there early as crowds were forming after lunch when we left.  Very interest visit with some wonderful items on show.",Tired and dated
"August 19, 2021","I have been visiting here every few years for nearly 4 decades and other than temporary exhibitions it has not really been updated. The exhibits are tired, and interactive elements are mainly broken or tatty, and the museum just does not offer a 21st century visitor experience. This is such a shame as the science and research carried out by their staff is rightly celebrated- but this is not apparent at all in the exhibits. Queuing for some time in a stuffy and crowded room to see an animatronic T Rex is neither surprising nor educational these days.",Great day out
"August 19, 2021",Great free family day out. Expensive cafe inside but you can bring a picnic. Spent around 5 hours in total. Would visit again.,A collection of history and science not to be missed
"August 19, 2021","Visited a few times before but took the kids this time, I’ll be honest this whilst still amazing was my worst visit. They haven’t relaxed enough post COVID, the missing dinosaur in main hall is a total disappointment and the rip off that is the magical beasts is not worth the money. That said the normal standard collections, information and history is amazing as ever",Disappointed!
"August 18, 2021",We visited last week with our 2 children ages 7 and 5. They have been desperate to visit for such a long time so we travelled from the north east for a few days so we could take them along.We arrived to massive queues but luckily nwe already had tickets so we didn't have to wait. When we got in there it was rammed!!! To the point that my 7 year old started crying because grown adults were pushing him! How we made it through the dinosaur exhibition without my husband getting into a fight is beyond me! We left after that without seeing the rest!Very poor crowd management from the museum.,Always great
"August 16, 2021",Always a great place to visit every once in a while.  Covid safe and one way directions.Even as grown ups its nice to see.,Fantastic Beats exhibition not worth paying for
"August 15, 2021",This exhibition was not worth paying for. Me and my nephew love the movies but this really did not have much to do with them and we both got bored quite quickly. Only a couple of props on show from the films. Quotes which have come from Newt’s “book” are displayed to describe some of the “fantastic beasts” and then there are a few bits to show how the so called beasts link back to real and mythological creatures that we may have heard of to show where JK Rowling got her inspiration from. A lot of reading to understand what is on show so not very good for younger children. The rest of the museum was good but very crammed with people considering you have to book a time slot which I thought was so they could monitor the amount of people visiting at any one time. ,24 years and still one of my favourite places.
"August 15, 2021",Simply nothing too much to be said. I've been coming here all my life and it never fails to fascinate me. Sometimes I go alone just to take in the pure awe of all their exhibits. I would recommend coming here to anyone (entry is free!). It's a lovely way to spend your day and the food is reasonably priced and very decent for museum food!,Certainly worth a visit.
"August 14, 2021","Love visiting here, always lots to see and do with not just items on display but the building itself. My two children loved following the map and interacting, reading all the information. Would highly recommend",Excellent!!!
"December 16, 2019",I got in the museum at the opening time and I got out 5' before closing time! I spent most of my time at the dinosaurs department! It was fantastic!!! If you visit London you have to go at THIS museum!!!,Amazing Museum!
"December 11, 2019","My wife and I had the chance to visit the Natural History Museum yesterday and we found it absolutely amazing. We only had a couple of hours to spend there so, my recommendation - give yourself some time to see all that there is!",Walk as Darwin did....
"December 10, 2019","This is a fantastic museum to explore both solo and with family.  Exhibits neatly arranged into easily digestible sections.  I wanted to see the wildlife photo exhibit, but didn't realize that I needed additional access / different admission (my fault) and unfortunately, on the one day I was there, it was fully booked.  Otherwise, friendly, helpful staff, and well worth the visit!",Need several hours to get through it all
"December 9, 2019",We loved our visit at the Natural History Museum. The range of exhibitions was amazing and we could not get through it all with the short time that we had. Kids seemed to enjoy themeslves as well (if the slight queue at the Dinosaurus exhibition of families was anything to go by).,Full of fun
"December 8, 2019","An elderly but noble museum of the old style. Has a huge range of displays of animals, plants and minerals from the natural world. Many of the exhibits have their own individual histories.  the museum is often crowded at weekends with families taking their children on an excursion.Some things are quite expensive but there are lots of things which are worth buying. It's a good place to buy original gifts or things for yourself. You really need to go!",Cavernous Cornucopia of History
"December 7, 2019","I was completely taken aback by the enormity, extensive variety and rich history offered by the Natural History Museum.From the moment the massive whale skeleton seemed to swoop down from above to the astounding spread of rocks and stones in the Geology Hall to the various exhibits, the NHM deserves a few days of visits to truly appreciate all that it has to offer.",An excellent museum
"December 6, 2019",An excellent museum with an overview of British history and contemporary life. Good display and great museum building. I would definitely recommend a visit.,A Monument that Bolsters Darwinian Theories
"December 5, 2019","Through all our many years of regularly visiting London, we never really had a chance nor ‘motive’ to visit this museum, a monumental rather forbidding ‘campus’ in the Kensington area.  But on a recent rainy autumnal day we thought it the best time to do so and we pinched ourselves for having ‘neglected’ to visit it before.For here are displayed the marvels of our planet and how it came to be, and with Darwin’s bust and the suspended skeleton of a blue whale on the ceiling as our introduction to the museum’s collections, we were alternately subjugated by and awed at the impressive specimens in the various galleries:  from the minerals to the planets to the evolution of man, this museum has something for everyone to study and appreciate.  The museum supposedly has a piece of Mars rock (!) which regrettably we did not get to see.  It’ll have to be for another time and for a much longer time than just one rainy afternoon.",one of the best museums ever visited
"December 5, 2019","I am not into museums really,  but this one is just fantastic! It's surprising that it is free of charge and the line is not that crazy really. The museum is exciting no matter how old you are. It's definitely worth a visit if you are in London!",A spectacular building and a stunning collection
"December 3, 2019","They have a huge assortment of items in their collection, plus temporary exhibitions (we saw the museum of the moon, which was gorgeous). Don’t miss the blue whale, the dinosaurs, or the treasure room. Also, the building itself is remarkable. It makes me think of Hogwarts, and it’s full of details like tiles that depict plants and animals. Great for kids as well as adults.",Huge and amazing!
"November 4, 2019","Even the building is worth a visit! The architectural style is evocative of Hogwarts school. The museum is divided by different sections, from mammals to human being, birds and earth. The most amazing section, in my opinion, is the red one (earth) where you can experience an earthquake simulation ",Amazing! A must see!
"November 2, 2019","Never mind all the amazing things to see inside this museum 💕 The building itself is incredible! Breathtakingly beautiful 🥰 I spent most of the day there, there’s so much to see! Loved it and would go again and again! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 💕",Free Museum in Kensington
"October 29, 2019",This is a free museum that is beautiful.  I recommend it for kids and and adults.  It was raining that day and nice to get inside.  They had lots of rooms to view.  ,Excellent museum
"October 28, 2019","It’s a huge museum where you can stay the whole day or come at least twice. There was a long queue at the front side so didn’t want to wait and walked away towards the science museum. There was another entrance with a shorter and faster queue so we entered in 5 min. There are many places to eat something but you can also eat your own food there. There is water to fill up your bottles. The museum is free but donations are welcome. The museum plan is 1 pound.The toilets were very busy. When we left the museum around 1 pm, there was still a long queue. At the moment there is an ice skating place in front of the museum. 9 pounds per person. It’s a great museum for all ages including adults. ",This place is AMAZING!
"October 27, 2019","It's free! But make a nice donation.Gorgeous architecture coupled with amazing exhibits. If you live in London, you should be a member and come every week.We bought memberships just for this one trip so we could see the Wildlife Photography exhibit that was sold out. Lots of cool perks including a quiet lounge with views of the city and the outside architecture.",Cool place
"October 27, 2019","We were standing in a kilometer long queue (took more than an hour) before we were let in, it was the week of school holiday. However, it was worth it!",Silent disco 
"October 26, 2019","Love how the museum puts on events like the silent disco. A great use of the space. Last night was the second one I've been to here and it was again, incredible. Great music and the building looked fab. Who wouldn't want to dance under the whale? Thank you for being brave with the space and doing things most museums would shy away from. ",Legendary
"October 24, 2019",This museum is the most famous for the natural museum. Walking into Hintze hall underneath the largest animal on earth was a memorable experience. ,Free Museum
"October 21, 2019",Excellent & Impressive - the entry hall will get your attention already!!!  Then there's the dinosaurs exhibit!!,FREE!
"October 20, 2019","This museum is free to the public. Has a wide variety from Dinosaurs and Mammals, to Birds and creepy crawlers. Rocks, minerals and human evolution. Great way to spend the day. ",Will keep you entertained for a few hours
"July 25, 2021","Visited the museum on a recent break to the City. Having been to London many times before, have never ventured as far as the museum. With Covid restrictions in place we did secure our free entry before turning up just in case numbers were high and we got turned away. Upon entry the iconic hallway is breathtaking with the Great Blue Whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling. The museum is broken down into colour co-ordinated areas so you can navigate and complete sections at a time. We did find some areas more interesting than others though it wasn't fully what I expected. We did visit the on-site cafe whilst at the museum for snacks and a drink. Prices were slightly expensive there but then I do appreciate its a captive market. Overall it was a pleasant place to visit for a few hours however now I've done it once I wouldn't rush back to return. ",Nice if you want a sauna.
"July 23, 2021",Ridiculously hot. We left after 20 minutes because it was like a sauna. You would think an attraction like this would be air conditioned when it was 29degrees outside.,National history museum
"July 20, 2021","First of all what a building, as soon as you walk in there is so so much to see and interact with, there was one way systems throughout the museum.",Must see!
"July 19, 2021","Great museum, loved seeing the museum that has been in so many films! Particularly liked the dinosaurs and so did our 3 year old.",Wish the dinosaur had taken some adults for lunch.
"July 19, 2021",They need to work out a way to have adults only times. The whole place was like a giant crèche. I dread to think what it will be like over the 6 weeks summer holiday. I have no problem with kids needing to learn but there was no learning going on. Mums were mostly on the phone.,Not an amazing museum but something to do while in London I guess
"July 19, 2021","Honestly, I was expecting a little more from the National History Museum. There just didn't seem to be much to see and given the size of the building I was surprised. The animal and dinosaur section is probably the most interesting but given the size of the building I felt like there should be more to see, especially when a huge section of the museum was dedicated to rocks which I'm sure some people loved but it just seemed odd. I've been to other ""National"" museums and they've been a lot more interesting but luckily it was free so really can't be too angry about it. Stop by if you have a spare 2 hours but I wouldn't go out of your way to fit this in.",Great time.
"July 18, 2021",Great day out and worth a visit. Lots to see and do and to learn about. My son really enjoyed the earth quake experience and the hands on things to try.,Dont take a camera
"July 17, 2021","Building amazingthe exhibition aimed at a family/child audienceVery unfriendly to photographers. A friend and I went to photograph the building for our own pleasure but the moment we entered, despite 1000+ people with mobile phone cameras, which today are very high spec, taking tens of thousands of images already wandering around we were pounced on within 5 mins for sitting on the floor, then 5 mins later a second approach by another staff member to tell us we couldn't use the floor to place our cameras to take images. ( tripods are banned, so we were not using ours ) we were then told we can't use any method to stabilize our cameras, floor included. we had 3 more staff approaches over the next 2 hrs regarding our photo taking.with thousands of high-quality images free to download already on the internet why bully and intimidate any visitor with a camera. PHONES are cameras !!!!!",Totally poor
"July 15, 2021","I found the museum was a pale imitation of the museum I first visited thirty years ago. Where are the extensive displays. I found the dinosaur exhibition goodish, the mammel exhibition mediocre, the whales and large animals looked so bored, as to the rest of the museum given over to interactive learning and of no interest except to kiddies. ",Good FREE day out
"July 13, 2021",Great free day out although some areas were closed there was still so much to see Wildlife garden was a bit disappointing but understandable as the pandemic is still easing. Wasn’t very much in the gift shop but I’d say this is a perk as I normally just buy stuff I don’t need or use Highlight was seeing the cheddar man - but almost walked past him! Would I go back? Absolutely,Loads to see
"August 31, 2019",Very much enjoyed our time here.  So much to see one could easily spend and entire day here.  Food is available in several cafes.,Amazing exhibitions
"August 30, 2019","This museum exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history. There are many displayed collections on animals, fossils, human biology and other related themes. I enjoyed mostly the dinosaur, the mineral and the earth exhibits with great footages and interactive displays. The building is large and stunning with different architectural styles: Romanesque, Gothic and Victorian. You may need to come back couple times in order to really take in all the information. Highly recommended. The entry fee is free and it was packed with young families (it was school holiday!) when I were there!",Amazing
"August 28, 2019","As an adult it is still one of my favourite places in the world. The building is gorgeous within itself, the exhibits are frequently updated so the museum is never the same. Great for kids as there is lots of entertainment and great for adults willing to learn",Big Crowds
"August 27, 2019",This is a great museum but it was hot and very crowded when we were there. It was a Saturday and school is out on holiday so surely that is why. Many amazing things to see and experience. Try to go early to avoid the crowds. ,Timelessly beautiful
"August 26, 2019","The Natural History Museum is a must-visit for people who love browsing museums, and also have a keen interest in wildlife and biodiversity. Here, you will find specimens of animals that have gone extinct or are now critically endangered.While the dinosaurs exhibit and the moon exhibit tend to be crowded, you usually get to enjoy quieter aisles in the higher floors.You can also explore how the museum is involved in research work to help protect existing wildlife.Great place for both the young and the old.",We Stayed Ages!
"August 26, 2019","So much to see and do here. We walked and walked and walked, and could have stayed longer! Loved the Dinosaur exhibition, including the animatronic T Rex! . The roof in the stunning Hinze Hall is hand painted with plants from all over the world and is quite spectacular. Definitely a great place to spend time in London and externally the building is so beautiful. ",amazing museum for kids
"August 22, 2019","We visited this museum with three kids 10 and under. They really enjoyed the visit. There was too much to see and do, to see it all in one day. We will definitely return. The museum guides are great souvenirs and well worth the money.",Best museum ever
"August 18, 2019",Spectacular is the word for this.  So many interesting sites and exhibitions. We enjoyed it. From fossils to skeletons and earthquakes. From rocks to bones. ,recommended
"August 17, 2019","I recommend visiting this museum, especially if you have children / teenagers, both for the architecture of the building and for the enormous amount of animals of every size, type and age. Everything is well exposed and explained, the rooms are spacious, the collection of diamonds on display is very beautiful, the tour in the sector where the formation of the earth is explained, the platform that simulates earthquakes is very exciting. All this and much more ... and it's also free.",One of my favourite places in London! 
"August 16, 2019","Wonderful museum, so much to see! Massive fan of David Attenborough so after watching one of his docs this was first on my list for London! You do need quite a bit of time here so get up early! ",Great Place
"October 9, 2019","The museum has wealth of info and is an amazing place. Ideally one would need days to go through every exhibit, but even if you have an hour it is worth a visit to the main exhibits! ",A must go for kids in London 
"October 8, 2019","National history museum -  a must go if you are going to London with your kids , lot of learning and experience and it's free.The first thing I noticed was the building such an architecture it's sufficient in itself to see.the huge dinosaur in the entrance is welcoming as that's a demo wat the museum has in store for us. I had less time so I couldn't see the whole museum but I did see the gems section and planets section found it very informative . There are guided tours which can be taken and I am sure they are worth it. However  one thing I liked was there were groups of small kids with teachers and museum people explaining them everything. That was very impressive.it requires atleast 3-4 hours to see the whole thing at your own pace and reading everything . There were   also lots of free activities throughout the day some practical, some demonstrations, all very interesting. I think everyone should themselves visit and take their kids also.attaching the screenshots of the map to help you plan your visit. ",Highly recommend a visit with children
"October 7, 2019","On a recent trip to London we visited this museum. You could easily spend a few hours here. Be prepared as it does get busy! Very informative and educational for kids and they learnt a lot. Did feel the signage wasn't great - took us a while to figure out how to get to the dinosaurs! Museum is free and worth doing but allow some time. There is a shop selling books, stones etc and also a small coffee shop on site. The science museum is next door but we didnt have time to do it but factor in some time if wanting to do both",Wow
"October 3, 2019","The billing itself are a great monument of an outstanding architecturere,we entered to see the dinosaur exposition, it is amazing, the moon exposition also remarkable, I recommend to visit this museum , you won't regret",Stunning building
"October 2, 2019","All attractions in the museum are very interesting but none compare to the building itself. Details of monkeys, birds, leaves in the portic arches reveal how are the people who erected it. Take time not only to see the skeletons but also to appreciate every detail at your sight.",Amazing museum in a stunning building
"October 1, 2019",Absolutely fabulous museum with amazing displays and interactive exhibits you could probably spend the day here as it is vast and there a various eating options available.Don't miss the Museum of the Moon exhibition which is currently on Until January 2020.And the whole lot is contained in a beautiful building.Very highly recommended.,Great for all the family
"September 30, 2019","I took my Mom, Husband and 2 Nephews who were 7 and 14 years old. Everyone loved it! It is such a great attraction and you could easily spend all day there. Luckily we got there just before it opened and started to queue (about 20 minutes before opening time) - i would definitely recommend doing this as when we came out at lunch time the queue was snaking twice round the building. It is a free attraction and there are lots of different exhibits to see. The building itself is beautiful and the grounds are also lovely - we took a packed lunch with us and sat outside to eat our lunch before heading off elsewhere in London. ",Free attraction you don't want to miss while in London
"September 30, 2019","The museum is huge, so you better prepare yourself for a good 3 hours to experience everything from the very beginning of humans on earth to our days. You can even experience an earthquake without the danger in real life.   ",Great organisation 
"September 29, 2019",Fantastic place. Free and super clean. Good place for everyone. Good organisation with maps and lift ,Magnificent museum
"September 27, 2019","Totally recommend to animal lovers, but even if not, the moon exhibit itself is worth the visit. Their invertebrate section was a bit small but arranged well. The dinosaurs were extremely well placed and the ""live"" T-Rex is a must.I recommend that you free up at least 3-4 hours ind order to get the full experience (unfortunately I only had a couple of hours and missed some of the exhibits).",Super
"September 7, 2019","Lovely time spent here went with my family and grandson who is 4. It was wonderful to see his eyes widen whilst taking in all the exhibits. It was busy, but worth taking time to look around, we did stop and relax under the moon. An enjoyable time.",Superb
"September 7, 2019","This is one of the best places to see. Soo great for children to learn basic things, it is full of activities and you can spend all day inside, specially when the weather is not perfect. And... it´s free.",The whole family will love it
"September 6, 2019",One can spend hours here and remain fascinated. So many things to see and will take more than a single trip. One of the best in the world.,"Worth a visit for sure, and it's free!"
"September 3, 2019","This place seems to be a great visit for all ages. Whether you're interested in history or not, the exhibits themselves are well laid out to catch your eye at every step inside!The exterior needs it's own post as that it something which WILL drop your jaw.Well worth a visit.",Wonderful experience
"September 2, 2019","We had a fun filled time at the museum. The kids were so excited that they were not in a hurry to leave. We did not have to pay to enter, it was free. Also the meal we had wasn't shabby. They had good kids meal pack at a good rate.",Worth a visit!
"September 2, 2019","I was very excited to see all the displays, especially the blue whale and the dinosaurs. It’s a good museum for children but even adults would have a wonderful time.The building itself is really stunning. The architecture is just really magnificent. They have listed all the highlights in their brochure so even those with limited time can enjoy the displays. I went during the peak season and the crowd was quite manageable. There may be a queue outside but that’s just for security, so don’t get discouraged if you see it. Best of all, entrance is free! Quite interesting souvenirs at the gift shop as well. ",Awesome place
"September 2, 2019","Very interesting place, lots of cultural memories. It is designed both for the adults, as well as for the children. Free entry and nice staff to guide you through it. Also, it is place in one of london's luxurious neighborhoods... With very beautiful architecture and nice vibe. ",Loads to see
"August 31, 2019",Very much enjoyed our time here.  So much to see one could easily spend and entire day here.  Food is available in several cafes.,Amazing exhibitions
"August 30, 2019","This museum exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history. There are many displayed collections on animals, fossils, human biology and other related themes. I enjoyed mostly the dinosaur, the mineral and the earth exhibits with great footages and interactive displays. The building is large and stunning with different architectural styles: Romanesque, Gothic and Victorian. You may need to come back couple times in order to really take in all the information. Highly recommended. The entry fee is free and it was packed with young families (it was school holiday!) when I were there!",Amazing
"August 28, 2019","As an adult it is still one of my favourite places in the world. The building is gorgeous within itself, the exhibits are frequently updated so the museum is never the same. Great for kids as there is lots of entertainment and great for adults willing to learn",Amazing building and exhibits
"June 15, 2019","Easy to get to on the tube.Wonderful exhibits such as the dinosaurs and mineral collection.Best part was the building, learning about the history of great scientists and the detail in the architecture.I would recommend not going during school holidays, it was very difficult to enjoy the exhibits with so many young people crowding the areas.",Unique impressive building with interesting architecture
"June 13, 2019",The museum has a unique curved glass ceiling mounted on curved iron poles.  The museum resembles a church layout and it includes a unique tree root showing the human  population census over thousands of years. An enjoyable free entry museum that is worth visiting,really impressive
"June 11, 2019","i highly recommend the place. its really impressive. we spent 5 hours there but we have not see it all. the building is impressive, very clean and organised, with lot of information. no queue (we visited the place on Saturday) the entrance was free and there is a nice gift shop as well. All the kids are so excited there.",I can’t believe this amazing place is FREE to enter!!
"June 6, 2019","It blows my mind that such an amazing museum is free to enter. I’ve paid over $40 US to enter museums smaller than this and with less displays. Strongly recommend donating to help them keep up the museum. I went 2 hours before closing time and realized I should have allowed myself more time. There was so much to see! I ended up skipping over some things to ensure I got to see the displays that truly fascinated me. As a marine biologist, I’ve always loved any marine life displays. The blue whale skeleton is amazing, but it amazed me when I realized that this wasn’t the only whale skeleton on display! There were 5 - the blue whale in the main entrance, then a bowhead whale, a right whale, a sperm whale, and a gray whale in the mammal display. There was also a life size blue whale model with over a dozen other life size cetacean models including orcas, Risso’s dolphin, narwhals, etc. The displays along the sides were highly educational as well. I do wish that the shark and ray displays were a bit larger. Corals and cnidarians had an entire room while there were 2 small displays that contained various sharks. ",Perfect for my kids
"June 5, 2019",We spent 2 days to visit this museum because my kids liked it. They enjoyed to look around all rooms and talked about what they saw. Perfect for the kids!!,Brilliant for all the family
"June 3, 2019","This was one of the highlights of our London trip. The museum is enormous with sections on Dinosaurs, Human Biology, Mammals and many more we didn't have time for. Even the members of the family that weren't keen on going enjoyed the visit!The dinosaur section is awesome.",Way too busy
"June 1, 2019","Went on a very hot Saturday. The museum was very busy and very hot inside! I think the museum needs to invest in more air con. It was so busy it was hard to see anything. Although in my opinion there wasn’t much to see, the dinosaur section was ok but the ‘human’ section just looked run down and old and needs updating. But it’s free so can’t complain.",Brilliant place to visit.
"May 25, 2019",Great and beautiful place.Very nice and willing staff.Cannot say more - just brilliant place to visit!,Loved this Museum and so easy to get too
"May 25, 2019","If you like architecture, this is the place for you. Its well organized and not over the top crazy busy. It only took us an hour to do the entire place and its Free. Take advantage of all the museums, well worth it.",Always lovely!
"May 25, 2019","The perfect getaway with the kids when we get bored of shopping and need to learn. This was the first time we’ve experienced any discomfort climate wise. It was extremely warm inside. Something must be going on with the ventilation system. Pizza and burgers at the T-Rex Grill are nice and reasonably priced. Best of all, It’s FREE! (But do donate when you’re leaving)",Wow museum!
"May 10, 2019","this place is free of charge, offers many interactive exhibits, kids were walking around for hours without complaining. the only bad thing is that you can't see it all in one day ;)!",Interesting!
"May 9, 2019","An incredible, grand building and extremely interesting however it was almost unbearably crowded, so crowded we had to leave. Some areas of the interactive area for children are definitely a little worse for wear which is understandable due to the free admission. Please give a donation upon entry as it's so important to keep these treasures up and running.",Amazing museum
"May 8, 2019","This was such a fun and interesting museum, and like most museums in London, free! Expect a crowd even in the offseason, as many locals visit often. The building itself is massive and a work of art in its own right. I'm sure the dinosaur exhibit is one of the best I have seen. The mineral and precious stone exhibit was fascinating. I did not make it to even half of the exhibits as we only had 2 hours to spend here on an EF tour. That is definitely not enough time! I think you would need a full day to do it justice. They even offer overnight events for children and adults! Talk abut a real night at the museum!",If you are a curious person
"May 8, 2019","There is so much to see here that I wish they extend the hours late into the night. My wife and I spent a good part of the day wandering amongst its huge halls to find wonders after wonders. Millienia-old trees, extinct animals, pre-historic meterites, etc..... Photos taken at the NHM are simply breath-taking as almost every exhibit make an incredible backdrop. Highly recommended.",Wonderful museum
"May 7, 2019",What a marvelous museum. There are actually 2 rocks from Mars here! Along with so many other items. A must see.,A Must Visit
"April 29, 2019","First of all, it is free and there are a lot to see. My daughter is into dinosaurs and she was very happy at the end (I won't give spoilers). And if you're into gems, stones, and minerals, you'll find them there as well! Not to mention all the stuffed taxidermy mounts of birds and mammals you will see","Once amazing, now ruined!"
"April 25, 2019","I first went to The Natural History museum in 1982 when I was 7 and it had a lasting impression on me. I've been a further three times since and it has never disappointed. However, my own daughter has just turned 7 and what better place to take her than to London to see the same sights. Alas, things change and not for the better. Gone are the fantastic rooms full of dinosaur bones, natural wonders and animals of the world. Gone the ability to roam and spend hours wondering from room to room. Instead, everything is now cordoned off. The public are 'kettled' into warrens. Shuffling along in steady droves to look at not actual dinosaur bones, but instead, plastic dinosaurs and animatronics. Gone are the rooms and rooms of exhibits. Replaced with cafes and endless shops, or VIP rooms you can't enter. What have you done to this wonderful treasure? It seems the persuit of money and the dumming down of exhibits has killed it. If you want a good day, I recommend the Science Museum around the corner. Where visitors can roam free, away from people, pens and ribboned off queues!",Free Museum well worth spending the afternoon.
"April 25, 2019","Great choice for any London visitor or family trying to stay out of the gloomy or rainy weather. From amazing dinosaur fossils to interactive nature exhibits, this is a must see for all ages. The admission is free, and the museum is better than most.",Ok!
"April 21, 2019","Good layout! Volcanos and earthquakes section very impressive. I had feeling we are walking to long from section to section. Dinosaur section was ok,  bit too dark. But the  museum itself as a building is beautiful. Stunning ",Beautiful! 
"April 21, 2019",Gorgeous museum. I loved all of the detail in the building. We weren’t able to spend much time here but it’s worth just popping your head in and seeing the main hall! ,Good not great
"August 30, 2018","First of all, and this won’t affect everyone and this can be extended to include most of London... if it’s hot outside, it’s hot in the museum. Like most public buildings in London, there is no AC. For Europeans this is expected. For others, maybe not so much. So suffice to say that the 90+ degree weather when we visited maybe affected our enjoyment of this and other attractions in London. Seriously, our favorite exhibits were the various fans placed around to cool down the docents and guards. Anyway, heat aside, to be honest, the building is the star here. The main hall is absolutely stunning and worth the visit by itself. The exhibits there are well presented and pretty cool. The slight problems come when you venture to some of the other halls. My 15 year old son has always loved dinosaurs so we were excited to see the world famous dinosaur exhibits. Our issue was the presentation. Most of the fossils were suspended above the floor and it was really dark so it made seeing them somewhat difficult. Maybe this is a temporary thing but it was not really that great. The mammals area was also fairly “meh” with a lot of replica animals mixed in with actual skeletons and such. A really strange thing too was the huge layer of dust on top of the blue whale and the other larger fake animals. Looked like it had not been cleaned in many years. The other parts of the museum seemed more science center than historical museum. Probably fun for smaller kids but my kids were maybe a bit old for it.One of the surprise cool things (literally... it had AC so maybe that also tainted this part of the review) was the Darwin Center. Obviously the newest addition to the museum it had some really cool stuff to see mixed with some newer technology sure to appeal to older kids. Overall, expect to be wowed by the structure itself and some of the exhibits. Just don’t expect to love it all and you will have a great time. ",educational fun
"August 27, 2018",Been chiming here with children since they were in pushchairs and still going now they are teenagers. always interesting. check their website for exhibitions,"Amazing, unforgettable experience"
"August 25, 2018","We really were just going to visit ‘Sensational Butterflies’ as it’s a street away from our holiday house and the kids were begging to go. But we ended up going there and also seeing a part of the museum.The butterflies are not caged or anything - they fly around freely and this startled my 5 year old a bit but my 2 year old was unbothered - he loved chasing them around!The butterfly tent is also not very big and you could tour it in a couple minutes but there are chairs to sit and chill on if you just want to stay around a bit longer - but it’s warm in there so you just wanna see the butterflies and leave.But it’s so beautiful and there’s loads and loads of colourful species!!The butterfly store at the exit also has great butterfly themed souvenirs and surprisingly well priced! Also For £6.5 a pop for entry, it’s a great deal! And that’s for the butterfly place - admittance to the museum is free but they ask for a donation at the entrance which you can give or decide not to - totally up to you.What’s not to love? Seeing the butterflies fluttering around was surreal- my kids aged 5 & 2 really enjoyed this and we got ice cream in one of the trucks on the grounds and went to the museum but only spent a few minutes as they were hungry and then we came back out, laid out a scarf on the grass on the grounds, got hotdogs and fries and drinks and we had a picnic!!! It was a load of joy!!!We got to see the butterflies, the dinosaurs, fossils, ants ( I had no idea there were so many species of ants!!!) and T-Rex etc. In the 1.5 hours we spent in but we did not go beyond halfway on the first floor at the museum so we will definitely go back.It was such a great experience though and the kids had the best time that I can’t possibly think of why anyone wouldn’t like this! There were babies and toddlers and teenagers and mums and dads and aunts and grandpas and grandmas - it’s is such an inclusive place - can’t believe I had never been!!! Looking forward to going again!",Great place to see Dinosaur fossils!
"August 23, 2018","This is a great place to take the kids.... lots to see and do and it is a family friendly... places to eat, etc. ",Interesting Place to visit if you are into Animals.
"August 12, 2018","I really enjoyed the displays,  especially the fossils, minerals, and the stuffed animals (taxidermy). One of the best thing about the museum is its variety, and they are all well presented and written. They have lots of activities (especially for kids), so it is a very family-friendly place to go!",A must see 
"August 12, 2018","You have to visit this museum, especially with children. Lots of interesting exhibits, some interactive and very well explained. It was very crowded, especially in the dinosaur section (we visited on a Monday morning). ",Wonderful museum - you could spend an entire day there!
"August 8, 2018","Our family loved visiting this museum. There's so much to see and do! Highlights were the beautiful entrance hall and giant whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling, the animatronic dinosaurs, and the many hands-on exhibits for children. Our 10 yr old daughter loved it! We spent 3.5 hours there, and would have stayed longer but we had a reservation elsewhere and had to leave. It's best to get there early. We got there shortly after it opened, and by the time we left (around lunch time) it was so crowded, especially at  the dinosaurs exhibit.",Crowded 
"August 6, 2018",Nice place to visit but for sure not in the hot summer as most places in London during summer are hot and not aircooled. ,Beware of the dinosaurs
"August 3, 2018","We visited this during a very hot day which may have slightly affected my review. The museum is very warm in that weather. The ""red"" area was the one I spent most of the time in. It was a nice temperature and really well laid out. It covers volcanoes, earthquakes, evolution of man and related areas. Although I didn't go my husband took one of our sons to see the dinosaurs. They stayed for a few minutes escaping at the first possible way out. He said the display is very badly set out, the whole point of going is to look at the dinosaurs and have photos, it was too crowded for this and had a member of staff telling everyone to keep moving. The T-Rex, a very important part of the display, is in a dead end meaning returning the same way. He felt it was an area with the possibility of serious problems.",A must
"July 29, 2018",Wonderful time in this museum. I would say this museum is good from 8 years old and up. Toddlers won’t find many things interesting. My toddler saw the skeletons and said monster. It’s a museum that’s filled with so much but age is a consideration to get the most out of it. ,Family trip to London
"February 10, 2019",Extremly recommended for all age groups. I have to admit I'm not a museum person but this museum is very interesting and lots of hands on experience. ,Con trick
"February 3, 2019","Wanted to see the Wildlife Photographer of the year exhibition, but was not allowed to enter without paying for membership as well as the admission. Despicable!",Spend a day at the museum! 
"January 31, 2019","The museum is beautiful! Love their attractions too! If you visit on Nov-Dec, they have a skating rink just outside the museum. Make sure to buy your tickets ahead to reserve a slot. ",Mind blowing 
"January 21, 2019","It would take a month to review this place properly - suffice to say, if you’re in the area, don’t miss it and free up a couple of hours.  Should be mandatory for all kids, a place of wonder.",So much to see and learn from
"January 19, 2019",Loved the national history museum and was amazed by the amount of things to see and learn from. You would need a full day to truly see everything and we found navigating even with a map a little confusing. Enjoyed the shop there and all the things it offers. ,Great visit with a 4 year old and baby in tow
"January 15, 2019","We live in London but this was our first visit to the museum with our kids (just turned 4 year old and a 6 month old baby). I was very pleasantly surprised by just how accessible it is with a buggy. The hassle is actually getting to the museum - South Ken tube is not at all accessible, a lot of steps to get up to station entrance level and then again to get to road level. On the way home we decided to just walk on foot to Victoria train station (from where we could get an overland train) and it took about half an hour and was better than lugging the buggy up and down a variety of staircases. We went on a Thursday in term time. It was busy in places - the volcano section in particular was chockablock with school trip kids - but generally we got to see everything without issue. Once there, the cloakroom is helpful and you can check buggies in for free so long as they are folded. You can also wheel them round the museum if you don’t want to check them in, everywhere we went was very buggy accessible. There are plenty of cafes and pit stops for food and drink. We had pit stop one in the cafe on the ground floor in the volcano/earthquake wing, a lunch box for our 4 year old was (I think) £5.50. That was for half a cheese sandwich, fruit, drink and a muffin.  There was mould on the muffin inside and they promptly swapped it for a free one but not the best start. We later had a proper lunch in the dinosaur cafe, which does pizzas, burgers and wraps. The cafe was quite quiet, the waitress said it tends to be less busy if weather outside is good (tourists tend to do the museums if they get a wet day). Food in the cafe was good and our 4 year old loved the animatronic dinosaurs in there. We were probably at the museum 1030-1500 and got to see most of what we wanted. We skipped through volcanos quickly due to volume of school kids, tried the earthquake room, then went through the insect room, then dinosaurs and the mammals section. We also did the big hall. The whale hanging in the big hall is good but frankly, it is never going to be a proper replacement for the old diplodocus that used to hang there! Our 4 year old liked the dinosaurs best (obviously) with the robot T. rex the number one highlight. There are also about one million gift shops in there so never fear that you will go home without a souvenir...There is also an interactive room in the basement (called Investigate I think) which features on “must do” reviews of the museum, we went down to go in as it’s meant to be excellent for kids, only to find it was shut for use by school groups only. I think the sign said it was closed all morning and until mid afternoon.  I’m not sure whether we just got unlucky on our day or if this is a permanent thing. Overall, a really great day and our four year old is already asking to go back again. ",Very busy 
"January 12, 2019","Visited on the 3rd January and was not prepared for how busy it would be. Visited once before when my son was a toddler and it was so calm so think I was just not expecting it. A lovely interesting museum, especially for kids, but sadly it was just too busy for us to see things properly. Kept getting shouted at to ""keep moving as its busy"" in the dinosaur section....how can you keep moving in a museum when you are supposed to read things? This seemed a bit odd and got a bit a annoying as felt they were rushing you out. Would have stayed longer and seenmore if not so crammed. Hope to return (on a quieter day!)","🏛Rich, educating and fascinating🦕"
"January 8, 2019"," Absolutely worths a visit.The quality and quantity of the preserved artifacts are surprising.The structure is suggestive and immense; it hosts several areas, each one dedicated to a specific theme: animal and human species and the various evolutions to date, passing through an interesting interactive path dedicated to human body, brain, emotions and their respective functions and abilities.The animal exhibiting area is breathtaking: it is literally surrounded by majestic prehistoric skeletons, exhibited with care and originality. Also the numerous animals reproduced and stuffed, from the oldest to the recent ones, is very suggestive to watch.The itinerary includes some salient details on the extinct and endangered species, exposing their causes and consequences.The wide ""Geology"" area reserved for minerals is stunning, you can admire many rarities on display. It' s also possible to try the simulation of a strong earthquake occurred in Japan in 1995.The structure is very well taken care of, the entrance is free, you can make a donation to the exit, and it will be certainly deserved for this museum so rich, educational (for children and not only) and original.It worths spending a whole day there.",Theme park for young children - tacky and noisy
"January 6, 2019","For children i’m sure it’s very good. Endless shops selling tacky souvenird, like plastic dinosaurs. Endless cafes, and between them play areas for kids.oh yes, the occasional exhibit, surrounded by screens, pictures and explanations aimed at - kids. All inside a beautiful historic building. If you want a theme park, no doubt it’s fine. If you want, what is it they call it? A natural history museum, look elsewhere. Vienna has a brilliant natural history museum if you can make it. If you want a kids playground, it’s perfect.",If time allowed we would have gone back
"January 3, 2019",Fabulous museum stuffed full of treasures from around the world. We spent 3 hours and saw only a small corner. ,mammoth of knowledge! 
"June 21, 2017","An amazing museum to see, observe and develop an amazing understanding of variety of genres. The entry to the museum is free. The museum is broadly divided into several sections and one can visit the section depending upon convenience. Efforts have  been made to emphasise on activity based learning to inculcate a better understanding! Totally loved this place. If given a chance, shall surely come back :) ",Must see!
"June 21, 2017",I couldn't see it but my wife & 4yr old daughter visited it and loved it! It's huge with lots of interesting stuff for children too..,Love this museum
"June 9, 2017","Everybody can explore the science behind the Aurora Pyramid of Hope, an unrivalled collection of 296 coloured diamonds. It was interesting to see the secrets of life and death in London over 5,000 years. 3 hours it's not enought to see all the exhibitions and attractions.",Family-friendly top attraction 
"June 1, 2017",A family-friendly museum and a-must visit. Free admission.  It has collections and exhibits including dinosaur skeletons and millions of specimens from around the world. They organised small group talk on specific topic. We attended the interesting session on butterflies.  There are charges for special exhibitions. Access via South Kensington station. ,Love love love this museum
"May 31, 2017",Had a good time walking the halls of this museum. Fascinating exhibits of dinosaurs and other extinct animals. Particularly love the volcanic displays and suppositions about how the world was created.,Good Museum and entertaining!
"May 26, 2017","The Natural History Museum is a good museum but I would say it is more designed for kids than anything else. Make sure you consider this if you're planning on visiting a lot of museums in London and the time is short.They have great exhibitions but most of them are for kids to play and learn. And Don't get my wrong... adults can have a great time as well but considering my previous experience with other museums I know it will cause a great impact on children.They have awesome fossils and the Mammals section is great. Make sure you check the Darwin Center and the Whales exhibitions...The Gardens are simply great... beautiful place and the architecture, like many other London public buildings, is amazing!Admission is free but you can donate some pounds to this cool place if you like! You can move around the place and visit V&A museum and the Science Museum as well... they are located next to each other!You can get here by bus and by Underground (stop at South Kensington station) but you'll have to walk a little bit... not too much!",Dinosaurs a must see
"May 15, 2017",Nice museum. Great dinosaur exhibits. Museum is free and houses educational exhibits. Several study areas. Mammals is another very nice display. ,Every time with new eyes
"May 1, 2017",Considering the huge lots of culture you get for free in a neat and tidy place I can only recommend that everyone visits the Museum. Couple of hours will do if in a hurry.,Very good free museum
"April 30, 2017","Like many other London museums, this one is free. Special exhibits have a fee. Highlights include the dinosaur exhibit, which includes some of the most complete skeletons and a T-Rex and other dinosaur animatronics; a simulation of the 1995 Kobe Japan earthquake, and many hands-on displays throughout. Multiple gift shops and eateries on premise. Can get very crowded. It was a good rainy day stop for us. As others have said, the line/ queue to enter can be VERY long, but do not be deterred. It does move very quickly and is relatively painless. World class museum.",Great for kids
"April 27, 2017","Dinosaurs section is a must, but other sections are also very good. If you go with kids, I recommend to go as soon as it opens at 10, since the queue got a bit longer when we were leaving and you need a couple of hours to visit everything.",Disappointingly static
"February 13, 2017","Have to admit this was a huge disappointment. Growing up in Sydney this place had a huge reputation do we were really looking forward to taking the kids,but they hated it . It was hugely crowded with adults even on a sunny day with next to no kids which should have been a giveaway. Although it gets a tick for being free the displays were static and dull . Don't bother with primary school age kids",It might be alright if there weren't any children
"February 9, 2017","The museum is undergoing a large refurbishment. You are unable to orientate yourself because the main entrance is closed. The numbers of children make it impossible to enjoy, as you are almost shoved out of the way. I went there last as a child and really enjoyed the memories, but now it is not really adult friendly and to say we were disappointed is an understatement. It was hot and noisy, with children making progress almost impossible. The V&A next door is a 5* attraction, as is British Museum. The whole experience has left my wife and me totally disillusioned and we will probably never return. The problem seems to be that our museums are being transformed into an ""experience"" for one particular group, to the detriment of others. I will therefore content myself with gaining knowledge from books - you know those papery things with a binder down one edge!",Great space
"February 5, 2017",With a number of other museums and definitely worth the visit as the space alone is beautiful and grand.,Wonderful experience
"January 24, 2017",Had a wonderful time in the museum especially the interactive portions of the museum. There is a lot to learn and see keep atleast 4 to 5 hours for your visit. I was not able to visit the photography exhibition that was going on but despite that there is enough to keep you busy. There are cafes and a restaurant inside to take rest in between the museum tour. All in all a very good experience and what makes it even better is that it is free to enter. :-),Fantastic Museum
"January 11, 2017",Absolutely loved our visit to this museum. Artifacts are so well displayed and easy to view. Highly recommended.,Must see for people that likes biology and natural sciences
"January 1, 2017","For people that likes biology this museum will be preferred from the British Museum. I think that both should be visited in your trip to London. Prepare to walk at least half day (10 am to 4 pm), no audio guides available but plenty of interactive attractions.",Very good
"December 15, 2016","It was very interesting and I learned a lot!! I loved the part of the dinosaurs, there was a huge T. rex that moves!",Interesting!
"November 27, 2016",Although it was very crowded and lots of kids I still enjoyed the exhibits at this museum.  Beautiful architecture too!,A must visit
"November 27, 2016",This museum is everything other reviewers have recommended or for. My only reservation is that because it's so popular it's sometimes tricky to actually see some of the exhibits because it's so busy. I'd recommend trying to find out it's quieter times especially in the paid for exhibitions. The photography awards exhibition was very crowded but also wonderful and the highlight of our visit.  ,Choose the visit time carefully
"November 27, 2016","Despite the review title, we didn't and it took about 30 minutes to get to the door (11 ish on a Sunday).The escalator through the earth's crust is smart. Quite warm and busy in the upper galleries though. Highlight has to be the diplodocus and the architecture in the room it's in. Truly stunning. The dinosaur exhibition area is brilliant and well worth a visit.Wear good shoes (for walking) and don't rush. You could easily spend a few days exploring the whole place.The cafes get busy but you can take your own food in. If you have the family it's a good way to eat.",Dinosaurs and Blue Whale: a must for any child (and grown up children)
"January 28, 2018","Excellent free museum.Security means a long process getting in, so come during the week if you can. The Dinosaur exhibition and Blue Whale jukebox were highlights.",Dinosnores (Sleep at the museum) - not what I expected!
"January 21, 2018","I purchased the Dinosnores as a special Holiday present for our family knowing that my kids were on the older side for this (9 & 12).  I don’t know why, but I imagined a small group of families having a magical camping/explorer adventure in the museum.  Maybe I got that idea because Dinosnores had been sold out for months when I first tried to book it?  We arrived and were faced with typical London queues and masses of people (500) at registration for the event, including large school groups!  Not the cozy event I had wrongly expected.  Arriving in Hintze Hall, we were greeted rather coldly and condescendingly by one of the staff and assigned a sleeping spot.  I was so glad we had brought our own inflatable camping mats as they only provided yoga mats.  We then were ordered to go to our first activity.  I understand that an event of this size is a Health & Safety nightmare and needs clearly communicated rules, but the military style of our leader was really off-putting.  The first activity was a rules briefing and science presentation about dinosaurs which led into a torch-lit exploration of the fossil section.  This was cool and enjoyable, although my kids had figured out at this point that they were not the target audience and started having a bad attitude...We were then bossed around by our strict leader to the eating area to eat our home-brought snack.  She wouldn’t allow us to sit where we wanted to keep her assigned group together.  We just wanted a booth, but had to sit right next to it, at a table.Next we saw a very entertaining and well-presented science talk at one of the theatres in the museum.  The two female staff scientists were engaging and really good and we learned a lot.We really wanted to go to sleep at this point (23h) and should have, but felt that we wanted to get our money’s worth, so moved on to the third activity of the night: T-shirt drawing.  My kids sleepily drew a dinosaur on a shirt.I assume they do three activities to tire everyone out, so no one gets any silly ideas and just falls into bed at midnight.It was cold and extremely drafty in Hintze Hall and they woke us at 7am, when we had to immediately pack up camp and go to breakfast.  Definitely bring your own as the one they provide is disgusting.My family was so over-tired that they wanted to go home before the animal show, but I convinced them to stay if we left right after and if they didn’t “have to” explore the museum before it opens its doors to the general public.The animal show was good, but we were all sleep-deprived and wanted to go home.  I’ve learned that a good-night’s sleep is really important to my family and that my kids are too old for this kind of thing!All of us felt that it was not really worth it for our family.   I do think a more warm welcome would have made for a better experience.",Great place to take the children
"January 20, 2018",A wealth of displays that will interest/entertain any child (or adult).  With very helpful staff who will help you find your way around too.  Watch out for the queues at busy times.,Bring back Dippy
"January 18, 2018",I would enjoy it even more if they were to give back the stolen Parthenon Marbles. Moving Dippy the diplodocus was a mistake.,A must see!
"January 7, 2018","The British Museum of Natural History is an absolute gem. To do this great museum justice, plan to spend the day. It's well worth the time.",Educational museum with free entry
"January 2, 2018",A very educational museum. Great for young and teenager children. Its a big museum that you can spend at least half a day there if you cover everything there. There's a donation box if you choose to donate.,Very interesting 
"December 31, 2017",I personally think that this place is wonderful for both adults and kids! You can easily spend a good 3 hours in here.,Very interesting 
"December 29, 2017","Amazing and interesting. Saw the dinosaurs and venom exhibit. The whale was amazing. Too much to see for one visit. Big queue, but it moves fast, half hour wait. Worth it ",Family day out
"December 22, 2017","It is free but they encourage you to make a minimum of £5 per person donation at the entrance. The range of exhibits are huge and to fully appreciate all, I suggest at least 3 hours. Some of the exhibits require paid tickets to enter. There are enough free exhibits around to spend your time there.",Very nice especially for children
"December 20, 2017",Very nice museum.  I think more a child than an adults pleasure. A lot to do for the children and shops mainly have toys for them. Still worth the visit.,Amazing building 
"December 19, 2017","The Architect that’s gone into this building is truly magnificent !  I found myself looking up at the building more than the history inside.   I have been a thew times now and always something new.  I can not believe it’s free to get in either,  so contribution towards the upkeep is always something I help towards.    You could spend your whole day in here if needed, it’s so big. The Dinosaur area really is amazing to see. At Christmas time the ice-rink is one of the best I have seen and very pretty with all the trees and centre piece lit up round the rink. No trip to London is complete without visiting this museum, and made even more special at xmas time. ",One of the best Museum !!!
"November 10, 2017",My visit to this museum was so pleasant! One of the best museum of neutral history I have been. I will recommend it. If you have children do not miss this museum. Your kids will love it!!!,Longon gem!
"November 7, 2017",It's the second time I go to the museum and I still enjoy it very much. Great for kids and adults of all ages. It is incredible how there can be a museum like this with free entrance! It is undoubtedly one of London's greatest attractions.,Loved it!
"November 5, 2017","A must -visit. I'd say that if I had to visit only 1 museum, I'd pick the Natural History Museum. Also because I simply love the architecture of the building.  I was completely in awe. ",Must go place! 
"October 10, 2017","It was the first place we visited in London and we spent almost a full day there. So much to see and really interesting exhibits. My son loved the experience. We went near Christmas season, there was an ice-skating rink on the ground of the museum. Highly recommended! ",If you're looking for a new pram
"October 4, 2017",This museum is insanely busy and there seems to be nothing in the way of ensuring too many people aren't crammed in. Once you see past that you see the below par exhibits. The dinosaur section was really poor in terms of the others I've seen across the UK and in Europe. In fact by far the most interesting experience was walking around the shop and flicking through books. The place just comes across as massively underfunded. I just don't see why they don't just charge a fee for non UK national tourists. Everywhere else in europe you spend 50 percent of your money on getting into museums. Plus it might make the museum able to create better facilities and exhibitions. So to sum it up. Go here if you want to spend an hour or two dodging prams whilst trying to have a look at below par exhibitions.,Whale expedition 
"October 3, 2017",First time in Natural history museum and I was amazed! Building architecture taken my breath away and when we entry it I lost my words too. Welcoming staff and amazing giraffe with its scallop - Wau! And it was just a beginning. We spend a lot of time in body expedition where we found too many interesting fact about our bodies. Whale expedition was unbelievable!! Everything so nicely organised and you can also play around with the bottoms ! Just perfect experience for us. Definitely will come back! ,Stunning and amazing.
"September 27, 2017","Looking at my watch as I reached the end of the exhibits I could not believe that over four and a half hours had flown by. Visiting the Natural History Museum was amazing, educational, fascinating and full of intriguing exhibits. I especially enjoyed the volcano, earthquakes, human ancestors, whales, dinosaurs, and giant sequoia exhibits. There are plenty of cafes so you can pit stop for a tasty scone with jam and clotted cream, like I did.",What a let down.  A theme park pretending to be a museum
"September 21, 2017","This museum has so much going for it, with some world class exhibits, some not able to be seen elsewhere, and then ruins it by trying to be a theme park for attention seeking dumbed down kids.  How patronising.  The museum assumes we want to be entertained rather than educated.  Huge disappointment.  Cannot properly see important fossils, and important and culturally sensitive finds are treated like circus extras.  Will not go back while they treat me like a dumbed down TV addict.","Amazing museum, not to be missed"
"September 13, 2017","I love a good museum and this is one of the greats! The building itself is so beautiful and you could probably spend a day just looking at the intricacies of the architecture and decoration of the stone work. You do need to have your bag searched on the way in but this is just a sign of the times and once you're in, it's not something you need to worry about again. (Personally I think it's a small price to pay to protect the safety of visitors and the priceless and historical exhibits)We spent 5 hours here and still didn't get to see everything but I would be so happy to go again. There are some ""copied"" exhibits but this didn't bother me so much as everything is so carefully cared for and laid out. There is a fountain of knowledge on so many subjects, I would have got lost for days reading every snippet of information. The stuffed animals can make you feel a little uncomfortable but I'm guessing that's why some of them are models. I have visited this museum previously as a child and remember it as a boring place with rooms full of bugs and stones on display but the improvements since then are amazing. Many of the displays are now interactive and some of the models move. They have clearly tried to make the museum more relevant and I believe they have achieved this while still remaining true to its roots. We didn't eat here but that was only because we had planned to eat elsewhere in London, not because it was to expensive or the food was unappealing. The toilets were clean and had attendants. The staff were helpful and knowledgeable.A great day, not to be missed!",Beautiful place but deserve more maintenance!
"March 20, 2017",Building is just amazing! It is very complete museum but pity how some parts are full of dusty. Need it more maintenance! ,Great free museum!
"March 18, 2017",I loved the Dodos and all the fossils.  Definitely worth a visit.Free entry- near south kensington station.   Great museum store too.  Moon rock in a small display in the entryway.,Phenomenal and Immense Museum
"March 16, 2017","This old museum of ancient delights has the cathedral-like 1880 Victorian building which is an unforgettable landmark. This architectural wander’s columns crawl with carved monkeys imaginatively clinging to the terra-cotta and floras sidling across ceiling panels. If you visit London this a must visit place, charming and incredibly huge museum.Few tips that could be helpful for a great visit :1.	The quickest way to get to the museum is to go to South Kensington station by London Underground and it is about five minutes' walk away.2.	Skip the main Cromwell Road door and use the small entrance on Exhibition Road, as it’s the quietest and step-free. 3.	The best way to skip the crowds is to arrive early in morning.4.	The Cromwell Road entrance leads to Dinosaurs, Creepy Crawlies, the Blue Whale, the Darwin Centre and the Wildlife Garden.5.	The Exhibition Road entrance is closer to Volcanoes and Earthquakes and the giant Earth model.6.	The new Darwin Centre has 22 million insect and plant specimens are takes nearly 17 miles of shelving.7.	Visitors under 7 years can take advantage of a FREE Explorer Backpack near the entrance of the Central Hall (must have valid I.D.). Included are kid-size binoculars and explorer’s hat, an activity booklet, magnifying glass, drawing kit, recording sheets and clipboard, plus clues to help complete a challenge.8.	School-age children ages 5 to 11 years can purchase self-led discovery guides with challenges and discussion topics for £1 each, also at the visitor’s information desk in the Central Hall.9.	You can take a free behind-the-scenes tour which last about 45 minutes. Numbers are limited, need to book at the information desk in the Central Hall.10.	Check the afterhours events, including evening gallery tours, night safari, late Fridays (extended hours, with snacks and drinks available - every last Friday of the month, excluding December) and even sleep-overs in the Natural History Museum.11.	Entry is free, but you need to buy a ticket for the IMAX Theatre, flight simulators and some special exhibitions.",Absolutely great!
"March 9, 2017","Went there with my granddaughter, 3 years old, she was enchanted with the dinosaurs, the big whale and, even with the spiders. The big stair going through the center of the Earth was also very good, we had to go up many times.It is an amazing place to make children get  interest in science.Recommend for sure!",A Sunday outing
"February 20, 2017","From the queuing at the side entrance onwards it turned into a location from hell! People don't have any level of courtesy left in them, we were pushed, shoved and bearded through the exhibition areas like 'Penguins in s huddle'. If you wanted to stop you were shoved, if you tried to get close to an exhibit you were moaned at and if you tried to pause then all hell broke loose around you for being so inconsiderate. People with pushchairs use them like pathfinder rams to make headway and most of the time they are empty. The museum is clearly trying to fit as many people through the doors as possible but to the detriment of visitor experience. DO NOT VISIT ON THE WEEKEND... ",Free day out
"February 20, 2017","We visited the last day of half term and got there for opening time and queued for around five minutes to get in. ( FYI on the way out the queue was HUGE and they were staggering entry).Overall we had a lovely day, the museum itself while grand and iconic.. we felt a little disappointing.Lots of displays were models or casts and generally it lost its authenticity. We did enjoy parts especially as some were relevant to DD school studies.Don't think we will be visiting again, although this time the Dippy was out on tour so maybe...Also the display cases and cabinets were quite dirty some with THICK layers of dust.. toilets also quite grim. We always take a picnic but passing through the cafe a small child's lunch box £5, cans of drink £2, grapes £2.75! Very dearNHM.. overall you could do better. Average rating ",Educational and entertaining!
"February 15, 2017",A must visit for people of all ages (& kids too!). Extremely interesting and well laid out with a great cafeteria too!,Disappointingly static
"February 13, 2017","Have to admit this was a huge disappointment. Growing up in Sydney this place had a huge reputation do we were really looking forward to taking the kids,but they hated it . It was hugely crowded with adults even on a sunny day with next to no kids which should have been a giveaway. Although it gets a tick for being free the displays were static and dull . Don't bother with primary school age kids",It might be alright if there weren't any children
"February 9, 2017","The museum is undergoing a large refurbishment. You are unable to orientate yourself because the main entrance is closed. The numbers of children make it impossible to enjoy, as you are almost shoved out of the way. I went there last as a child and really enjoyed the memories, but now it is not really adult friendly and to say we were disappointed is an understatement. It was hot and noisy, with children making progress almost impossible. The V&A next door is a 5* attraction, as is British Museum. The whole experience has left my wife and me totally disillusioned and we will probably never return. The problem seems to be that our museums are being transformed into an ""experience"" for one particular group, to the detriment of others. I will therefore content myself with gaining knowledge from books - you know those papery things with a binder down one edge!",Great space
"February 5, 2017",With a number of other museums and definitely worth the visit as the space alone is beautiful and grand.,Brilliant place for kids and adults.
"October 27, 2016","This is a fabulous free attraction near the Embassies. Plenty to see and explore inside and lots of local restaurants when you are tired. My 8 year old became upset at some of the stuffed animals, which I had not consider, so perhaps worth exploring with yours if you have sensitive children.",Brilliant
"October 16, 2016","The best museum of its kind I've been to! An excellent collection of fossils, animals, rocks... I was only slightly disappointed with the 'Human' exhibition, which had nothing on display other than screens and interactive games for children.","Fun for everyone, if you are lucky"
"October 10, 2016","A must see attraction in London, especially for families. You must allow for a minimum 30 minutes queuing during school holidays. The near CGI dinosaur in the Dinosaurs' area is well worth the visit in its own right.",Nice museum but packed
"August 24, 2016",We went to this very nice museum with our two little kids. We liked the impressive animated dinosaur. And the rest of the museum was very interesting. The earthquake simulator was great.,Great! 
"August 23, 2016","There are loads of great exhibits in a beautiful building. There was quite a queue on Saturday afternoon (during school holidays) but it went down fairly quickly. I was also glad to see this was free as everything else in London seems very expensive. Very friendly, helpful staff. Good toilet facilities. ",Huge... With a crowd to match
"August 12, 2016","There was a crush of people, especially at the popular exhibits, i.e. dinosaurs. Beyond the exhibits, I really like the architecture and layout of the halls. Would love to spend an entire day here... if only my legs could take it (& if I didn't plan to visit the neighbouring museums).",Amazing place and great for kids too
"August 10, 2016",What an amazing place this is. Alone or with children this is an amazing place to visit with plenty of things to see and do. I would definatly recommend going to look around and spend a happy few hours ,Great for the Family!
"August 9, 2016","My children love the dinosaur exhibit!  It's changed in the past year.  It's more accessible to and easier to walk through, but not as fun as the original! Go early or late.  If you have a stroller (buggy) use the entrance on the exhibition row as there is a lift (elevator). The best cafeteria is in the middle of the museum (Benugo).  It has a good selection of food beyond just sandwiches! visit multiple times.  So much to see.  Don't attempt to see the whole museum in one day. ",nice building
"August 4, 2016","The building itself is the real star here.  The exhibitions and displays are good, but there are so many people there, it is hard to really enjoy them.  Nice free (donation requested) activity.",Celebration Party
"July 27, 2016",One of the best nights of our life in the graduation ceremony of our MBA at LBS. It is very recommended to attend a night event in the museum and not just the regular daily visit.,"If you could only see one museum in London, let it be this one!"
"July 26, 2016","I have many fond memories of visiting this museum as a child, and now that I take my own children there I still think it is possibly the best museum in London! The dinosaur bone collection alone is worth the trip! The building is stunning! The exhibits are amazing! The entire museum is just fantastic! ...and it's free! We are so lucky to have this beautiful museum, and impressive collection, here in London! If you are planning a trip to London, make sure you visit this museum, not to mention that you have the brilliant Science Museum, and the wonderful Victoria & Albert (V&A) museum right next door! Be advised though, the queues outside can be very long during peak periods!",I couldn't beleive that it is free!
"July 21, 2016","Just next to the A&V museum (interesting medieval artefacts) and Science museum (fantastic), this is a great place to visit for free in London. Reserve some 2-3 hours for visiting, there are a lot of great things to be seen.",Kids loved it!
"June 14, 2016","The dinosaurs are of course the main attraction here but having just been back from Iceland, my kids totally enjoyed the section on volcanoes and earthquakes. My boy also loved the section on how the earth has evolved. Great exhibits, educational and entertaining at the same time. Try the entrance at exhibition road instead of the main entrance. It usually has a much shorter queue.",Membership has great benefits!
"May 24, 2016","I wanted to extol the virtues of membership of the NHM. I am a single father with 2 pre teen children, so the usual family (2+2) deal for the paid exhibits does not work for me. However, membership definitely does. The biggest advantage is that for the subscription fee of £61, not only do I get into the paid exhibitions free, but I get 10 free guest passes. So membership paid for itself in 3 trips! We have been to the amazing wildlife photographer of the year and Otherworlds exhibitions twice, and are going next to the butterfly experience. You also get to jump the queues; don't have to book time slots, and get the NHM magazine, that the children love. A great way to save money and support the museum!",A beautiful and interesting place for people of all ages!
"May 23, 2016","Arrived on a weekday about 11am. Many, many people queuing to go in. There were many others already inside. But everyone was considerate and orderly.In the great hall just as you enter the museum is the fossil of a T-rex! Obviously everyone was trying to take a picture of it or with it.The great steps behind with a huge white statue of Charles Darwin was also a photo pit stop.Even small kids were fascinated with the collection. The seniors were equally spellbound with all the exhibits.Dinosaurs! Mammals! The workings of he human anatomy! Some many rooms to explore! Many hours to spend here!Free-of-charge! No entrance fees! Donations are most welcome!",Something for everyone
"May 9, 2016","I was thoroughly impressed with this Museum. There are numerous exhibits, it is informative and interesting, some thing for all ages. There is fee to enter just a donation.",Excellent 
"May 6, 2016",Visited the wildlife photography exhibition. Not a museum person but was pleasantly surprised at the place and exhibition. Loads of other things to see as well and some nice cafes in the museum.,Amazing 
"May 6, 2016","If you mention London, a lot of people will suggest going to the NHM. It's honestly amazing. Very informative, entertaining and interesting. Check the website for any special exhibitions. The museum is free but some of the limited exhibitions cost. The best bits were the mammal fossils, the blue whale made to scale (it's the size of the room!) and of course the dinosaurs. We went on a Friday afternoon, and the place was busy. I've been on a bank holiday and its insane how busy it gets. So if you're visiting during the holidays try to get there early! ",Brilliant day with staff on the ball for kids with Autism
"April 2, 2016",Took my 2 teenage girls and 10 yr old boy (ASD) one of the best places I have ever been for staff having awareness.  Allowed us to stand in quiet spaces when queues were too much. Suggested quieter routes. Asked what they could do to help. Told us who to approach for additional support if we needed it. Even personally escorted us from one gift shop to another as the bag we wanted to buy wasn't in main shop.. you may see this as not losing a sale.BUT... the man that escorted us was BRILLIANT with my son...to the point that he walked through the main hall full of people laughing and talking about gaming. Every person from security to canteen has at least a basic knowledge of autism.. WELL DONE NHM xx,Amazing.
"March 29, 2016","First of all i would like to mention the staff. Our son has Autism & queing for a long time can be very difficult. I sent an email before hand asking about this & we where taken to the front of the very long que straight away on showing our letter.What a fantastic place to visit. So informative & especially if you are interested in the most amazing creatures that walked on our planet, the Dinosaurs. Amazing fossils, especially the Triceratops. Incredible. Bring your kids asap.",First traffic jam museum experience
"September 22, 2015","The collection in this museum is probably fantastic, there was only no way of getting near any of the displays. On a rainy day in the holiday season: do not even think about going here. The place was packed, the children (all 6000 of them) seemed to be screaming. The energy in one phrase: nobody who was here, really wanted to be here.",Spent 4 hours and didn't see 100% of it
"September 20, 2015","It's enormous, very diverse, quite exciting for adults and kids alike. The best part - it's free (together with Science Museum and V&A). A must have, definitely! Plan at least a day for this and science museum. Plan 2 days if you plan to do V&A as well.",Awful
"September 2, 2015","We arrived mid afternoon and saw a queue for the dinosaur room which we joined, thinking it wasn't too long and we would be in and out in no time.  After an hour in the queue, (the museum is very hot with no ventilation or fans to keep you cool and no signs to tell you how long the average time it would be), we got into the room, its was a great exhibition but there are no staff on hand atall once on the raised platform to assist or move people on who are taking photographs of the displays.  Also once you are on there, there is no exit off so you have no choice but to follow it round.  Part way round I started feel ill with the heat, but I had to keep following the slow queue of people round, unfortunately people were very reluctant to move.The displays were very good and I was impressed with them, however there was a lack of staff and ventilation which ruins the whole experience.  If you have children I would make sure they have sufficient drinks and things to keep them occupied in the queue otherwise by the time you get to the exhibition they will be agitated, from what I experience from other families.That was the only exhibition we saw as we had to get out as soon as possible to get some fresh air.  Sorely disappointed as other museums we visited were better organised.",Really beautiful museum
"August 26, 2015","Just  walking  up  to  this  building  will  put  you  in  awe. The  architecture is stunning. When  you  walk  in you're greeted  by  Dippy, the  dinosaur skeleton. I would  suggest  going  to  the  earth  oriented  part-as  in  the  planetary section and  earth's natural disasters  as well as  the  geological  mineral and  rock  exhibit.  In  this  area,  they  have  an earthquake  simulator platform mimicking the same  quakes felt by the Kobe earthquake. Just riding the  escalator up  to  these  exhibits through  the  giant  earth is  awesome ",It was hot and crowded beyond measure.
"August 21, 2015","It was beyond hot. After an hour my clothes were sticking to me. People were sitting by the bathroom red faced, looking like they were about to pass out fanning themselves. We only made it to the first floor. We could hardly see anything because there were so many people in the way. You couldn't move without bumping into someone or stepping on a kid. We stayed an hour then left. My kids and I did an online tour of a museum in the United States and didn't see anything in the museum that we didn't see in the online tour. Highly disappointed! I enjoyed walking around the parks down the road more than this museum.",Wow!
"August 13, 2015","Never been to a museum like this one.  Unfortunately only allowed 2 hours to look around but will come back again.  A free museum that has loads of exhibits and information.  The dinosaurs of course, were a hit with the kids (10 & 12).  Staff were really friendly and helpful (when we got lost).  Came out of school holiday time and arrived as the gate opened, we were inside within 10 minutes.  Quite a few school groups  roaming around but not so busy.",Plan ahead to make the most of your visit with young children
"August 10, 2015","We are based 2 and a half hours away from this museum by train but have made several trips with our young children - now 4 and 6.  We find it a very visitor friendly space: crowded yes, overwhelmingly so? No.  For us the trick is not trying to do it all in one visit.  There are 4 zones and we concentrate on 2 each visit - about 2 hours worth - and then pop next door to the Science Museum for another couple of hours. We always do it this way round because for some reason the queue to get into the NHM is way longer and build during the day.  No queue at the SM at 1pm on Saturday 8 August!  Personally I find the food & drink here expensive as I don't live in the South and still think £2.55 for a cup of tea is extortionate.  We take picnic lunch and eat in the designated picnic areas in each museum (not in the actual galleries). I recommend the one in the basement of the NHM. Well laid out, spacious, clean, cafe next to for tea and coffee etc.  The kids activity book is £5 and can be bought instead of a donation as the whole profit goes to the Museum (win/win).  It has a map, stickers, facts etc and helps carry on the adventure at home.  Hope this helps you enjoy the day as much as we did :)",A gem in the heart of London
"August 3, 2015","Fantastic attraction, imense place very well preserved, pre-historic animals, volcanos, earthquakes (there is a small room where you can experience the true sensation of an earthquake). And the best of all, it's for free!!!. I strongly recommend the Natural History Museum. ",Crowded and Too much to see in one day
"July 24, 2015","The NHM was really crowded, we had to queue outside for about 30 minutes to get inside.  It is overwhelming how much stuff they have and I'm glad we will be here long enough to make a return visit.  ",I was probably expecting too much
"July 24, 2015","I must have visited at the wrong time, or probably was thinking about somewhere else... but I wanted to see dinosaurs, and I think I saw enough... Maybe I went to the wrong museum perharps?",try the earthquake simulation
"February 9, 2020","besides the dinosaur skeletons, the best part is the planetarium and the earthquake magnitude 8 quake simulation",Very interesting 
"February 9, 2020",The building is impressive as is the content. Well worth a visit with teenagers. Dinosaurs section is probably the highlight ,Outstanding 
"February 8, 2020",We spend a whole day here.And there was still a lot more to see.You need more than 3hours if you run through the whole area. Highly recommended,An excellent experience
"February 8, 2020","A walk for the whole family, you can discover impressive things and the best of all is that most of the exhibits are interactive. The dinosaur sector did not have much to do compared to the other sectors and was very crowded. But overall a memorable experience.",Dinosaurs and minerals
"February 8, 2020","The dinosaurs had a great exibition, as expected. The mineral part was at least as impressive and we spent even more time there. The building itself is worth the visit if you are in to beautiful buildings. ",great for kids and adults
"February 7, 2020","With lots of hands on exhibits and interesting sience halls there is something for everyone.My favorite room was the mineral hall which had the largest uncut emarald and a collection of diamonds in every color ever discovered.The dinosaur exhbit was also fun, with the anomotronic t-rex and able to touch sample of bones and footprints",Wonderful for anyone really
"February 7, 2020","The layout of the museum was superb. I went on a weekday around 11 and there were a few groups of school children but other than that it was not packed. I enjoyed several displays, the hummingbird collection which lovely. This museum also has a nice area for eating and affordable gift shops.",Looked great but very busy
"February 4, 2020",Visited here on the 1st Feb (saturday) and it was crazy busy. It was just a river of people in the Dino section. You could not even try and stop to look at anything as yu would be crushed in the stampede.If you could get a day where it was not so busy then it would be a great place to visit.Settled for the Earth stuff and this kept us entertained.,Not as good as I remember 
"February 3, 2020","We visited here for the first time in an awfully long time. We both felt it was not as good as we remembered it. Cannot put a finger on it, but somehow a couple of stuffed animals and a few bones looked tired. Also, there is a lot more opportunity to buy dinosaurs stuffed with recycled plastic bottles, than there used to be. Feel it needs to modernise.",Excellent Free place to go
"February 3, 2020","Fabulous place with other museums within a few hundreds metres away. The building itself is enormous but inside are the most wonderful displays, interactive centres and beautiful places to eat. We visited approximately 2-3 hours and this wasn’t long enough. We would definitely go back to see this very interesting place. My 12 year old loved it. The shops were a little expensive.",A Great Time.
"April 10, 2015","Took my son here and we loved it.  Got there a bit before 10 and joined the long line.  However, once the place opened, the line moved quickly and we were soon inside. We immediately went to the Dinosaur exhibit and later were so glad we did this first, as the line for that grew immensely over the morning.All of the exhibits were great and my son immersed himself into the different halls.  I know in the end we did not see everything, but I'm sure we will return again to explore more.",Headache inducing
"April 1, 2015","Pros: Beautiful building Fab displays and facts Free Cons: The queues were simply horrendous. Particularly annoying are people generating more queues by taking selfies with the dinosaurs. Soooo irritating The dinosaur queue is not worth it. Felt like a feat of endurance to make it to the robotic trex. Then, once there, you can't stop, cos it makes a bottle neck. Kids screaming / crying /charging around. Can't read the placards if you wanted to. I agree with another reviewer: make an adults only day!!! Nothing wrong with the museum / displays / curators. It's just all about the volume of people spoiling the experience",Must see Museum
"March 29, 2015",Go to see the beautiful building and the dinasours. But once you are inside there are lots of things to see and explore.Remember the treasures and the enormous tree at the top of the stairs.Can be crowded. Free entrance.,Very interesting
"March 13, 2015","Went here to fill some time, and it was free. We looked through the Blue Zone (the dinosaurs and then human biology). Both were very interesting. There were many dinosaur fossils which were very interesting, and a lot of information about them and the lives they would have lived. Human biology was quite interesting, and the part about vision/perception was fun. I think it would be a great place for families, and I would also recommend at least half a day, if not more (we only had about 4 hours, but we do like to take our time and read everything).","Really crowded, but interesting. Check out stone creatures on the outside of the building!"
"March 10, 2015","I like that the Natural History Museum (and many museums in London) are free. Then I feel like I don't have to see every last thing in the museum to get my money's worth.  The Natural History Museum was super-crowded the day we were there. It was really crowded on the walkway that is above the dinosaur exhibits.  And I have to vent: I don't mind that people take photos in museums, but it drives me crazy when they take the photo and stand there to post it. And stop it with the selfies in museums. It is rude to the rest of the people there. But, back to the museum itself...The building is amazing.  Especially take a good look at the outside, where there are sculptures of all kinds of creatures.  I loved the inside with the huge atrium, and of course the wonderful sculpture of Charles Darwin at the top of the steps. Check out his eyes, they are so lifelike.  There is tons of wonderful things to see in the museum, so enjoy. When you need a pick-me-up, they have a nice cafe for scones, coffee, tea etc.","Crowded, Confusing and Dissapointing"
"February 25, 2015","I had visited the Natural History Museum quite a few years ago when my first child was 10+ and now decided to revisit for the benefit of my second child. Our first experience all those years ago was excellent and we expected the same and perhaps better.Right off the bat, there was a massive queue to even get in. It was drizzling and freezing and we had to wait for over an hour.As we entered, we were shocked with the amount of people we saw (see attached photo). In fact, we could only see people and nothing else. Even the large iconic Diplodocus skeleton in the middle of the grand hall looked tiny and swamped! There seemed to be a massive queue.The exhibits themselves were disappointing with a lot of stuff missing. Entire sections were being refurbished and were off limits.There was general chaos and the lack of proper signs or maps was frustrating. The few staff that we could seek out were not particularly friendly but who can blame them with the sea of people they are having to deal with. There were people sitting on the floor and some seem to be sleeping while others were checking their phones - looking dejected and bored! It looks like a railway station in India or China!I would suggest avoiding this attraction till all the sections are open and the Museum comes up with a better way of organizing the flow of people and the signs etc. I woud suggest they start charging an entry fee so that it would slow the entry of people just wanting to get away from the cold or rain!","Always a great place to visit, young and old alike."
"February 17, 2015","50 years after my dad first took me it never fails to impress. The building itself is a wonder to behold. It was opened in 1881 being an iron structure clad in terra cotta tiles - honey and blue in colour. Sculpted in the tiles are hundreds of animals, both modern and extinct. See how many monkeys you can find climbing the round arches in the main central hall, recently renamed the Hintze Hall after a generous donor.The latest addition to the museum is a stegasaurus called Sophie. It is the only one outside of the USA and the best preserved example of this curious dinosaur. Enter the museum by the Exhibition Road entrance (the old Geological Museum) not only to see Sophie, but also to avoid the long queues at the Cromwell Road front entrance. This is the Red Zone of the museum which is about Roscks and earth processes. Don't miss the earthquake experience at the top floor, reached by a long escalator.The dinosaurs are what children young and old love to see - including the animatronic ones. There are queues to see this, so you can book a time-slot ahead of your visit to save standing around. In the basement is a room where children can get some hands on experience with magnifying glasses and microscopes. Also there is a large picnic area where school parties can eat their sandwiches as well as anyone else wanting to sit and have food brought or bought.The Darwin Centre is a modern building and worth a visit. It is in the shape of a vast cocoon and is the largest building made from spun concrete.Don't miss the Treasures exhibit. This is up the stairs from the main hall and, in a darkened room, are some of the most precious items out of the many millions in this place - including a skeleton of a dodo. Unfortunately the feathered dodo was not to be found in the birds section - it is being refurbished - as is the Lucy ape-creature (not too disappointed as I'm not an evolutionist). And don't wait too long to visit if you want to see Dippy, the diplodocus dinosaur. This has been here since 1905 and will be removed in 2017 to go on tour around the UK.",Top Tips To Beat The Queues In School Holidays
"February 16, 2015","I visited with my two teens during Febuary half term, the first tip I have is to beat the initial queue to get in, go round to the side entrance next to the science museum, this has significantly shorter queues, if you want to be able to walk through the front entrance then do so as you exit to save time ! Once we were in the museum there was a queue of over an hour for the dinosaur exhibit, not many people know this but you can actually pre book a dinosaur gallery visit for free online during school holidays, online booking usually opens about a week before the holidays, you get a booking code and can walk to the front of the queue to the annoyance of everyone in the queue ! The dinosaur gallery is the most popular exhibit in the museum and really is a must for families, following the tips will keep you sane and avoid those ""how long"" questions.",fantastic museum
"February 14, 2015","fantastic museum and worth visiting, especially if you have kids.  Time saving tip…if there is a long line at the Cromwell Street entrance as there was when I went there (massive line winding all the way back to the street from the front door) simply walk around the corner to the Exhibition Street entrance and chances are there is no line at all and you can walk straight in.  Definitely try and avoid school holidays if you can as it is really busy.",For all dinosaur and nature enthusiasts!
"January 24, 2015","I have been going to the NHM for years - as a child, then to take various nieces and nephews and finally with my own children. It was and remains a brilliant day out.  First of all, the outside of the building is beautiful, just look for all the statue creatures around the tops.  Once inside, the dinosaur section is as good as you would want it to be.  After that, we like the natural world section which is opposite. A couple of tips...It gets very busy and it is well worth going at opening time.  If there is a big queue at the front then there is also a side entrance next to the Science Museum. Once inside, make sure that you do the dinosaur part first as that gets busy very quickly and there is often a separate queuing system for that.  The shop is a little expensive but there is a good selection.  The best shop is opposite the insect/bug section.",It's been ages and ages.........So glad to return.
"April 7, 2023","The last time I was here 'Dippy' was on the meet and greet which was some years ago. 'Dippy' has been replaced by 'Hope' the Blue Whale in the the great 'Hintze Hall'. It's a magnificent room with a seated statue of Charles Darwin keeping watch up the first set of stairs. If you get to choose which way you enter the museum choose the front, I took a side entrance in but had to make my way to the Hall before I felt I was really here. It's the heart of the museum and for me one of the most amazing rooms there is, anywhere.'Hope' takes centre stage in the main hall but is suspended from the ceiling so whilst she is amazing in her own right and maybe bigger than 'Dippy' she lacks the eye level, massive dinosaur, impact that 'Dippy' used to have.  'Hope' however is the real deal.If dinosaurs are your thing the there is a separate room for them and a few other dinosaur skeletons doted around the museum. The main dinosaur room is dimly lit and is hugely popular so can get cramped.An animatronics' T-rex is one of the first big dinosaurs you see, but there are other better and real ones to see. T-Rex looks like he shares the same dentist with Jurgen Klopp, the Hollywood teeth on a dinosaur just looks wrong, at least he wasn't wearing sunglasses !Various other rooms featuring a plethora of extinct animals, cats, whales, human evolution, insects and far too much to see in one visit. The most recent exhibit is 'Titanosaur' possibly the Biggestest dinosaur in the world ! It's just gone on display and requires a separate timed ticket so pre-book before you get there. There is a fee to see this exhibition but it has just gone on display so was extremely popular. I failed to get a ticket the night before so will have to visit again soon but no matter there really is so much to see on multiple levels, just make sure you get a map and as a tip start in the main hall, it has a Wow factor all of it's own.The only downside is, as with any free to enter museum, there's just too many people and they have a captive market for food and drink.",Magic Memories website
"January 23, 2023",Still no photographs received after paying online to Magic Memories.com over a month ago. Unable to get refund.  Be warned.,Too hot to enjoy.
"August 23, 2022",Great museum with an amazing array of things to see and do but it was UNBEARABLY hot and the feeble warnings here and there were not representative of how hot it actually is. We couldn’t wait to leave.,FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE
"July 10, 2022","I spent almost 4 hours in the museum and loved the many displays from Dinosaurs, Mammels, Birds, Darwin and more. I believe this museum to be the best in the world, certainly the displays are done at a top notch level for both adults and children",Great historical visit
"May 19, 2022",You can spend hrs here - there is so much to see and read and it's brilliant for kids of all ages. The building is stunning too.,take the kids
"March 28, 2022","went primarily for the wildlife photography exhibition, but struggled with the museum, its very disjointed, and very crowded, an may be its more geared to a younger audience, though i found the marine and mammal section interesting, but both under served.",Natural History is Awesome
"February 6, 2022","Lots to see and an interesting mix of displays. From saving the planet, dinosaurs and lots, lots more, you could ask for a better setting. The building is stunning.",Great architecture - but too many kids!!!!!!
"January 26, 2022","***disabled reviewer***I have to say, I didn't enjoy this museum as much as I thought I might.  Mainly because I'm a childless adult.  there are a LOT of kids here, and fair enough.  it's just very noisy and very difficult to get near anything as the kids sort of, dare I say it, get in the way! eek! The exhibits were wonderful, but I'd steer clear of the dinosaurs bit, it was so crowded and not that great tbh because they were mainly 'replicas' or animatronics.  Not the real deal.The great hallway is magnificent, even without Dippy.  I particularly loved the architecture.  Look around at the walls when you go - you'll see some wonderful things.We ate at the T-Rex diner - it was busy (1pm ish!) but we were seated at a table with a number on, you go up and order, and they bought the food within about 5-10 mins! The drinks took longer - but hey, it's busy.  We had a New-Yorker sandwich, made fresh to order, with large chunky, fresh bread, and plenty of fries.  The table had a bottle of water and two thimble glasses.  Our drinks order was also tiny, but for the price (around £15) it was good value. The pizzas looked great too - freshly made, with charred bits and plenty big enough for dinner, not alone lunch for one!  I was also able to charge my scooter here.The staff here are friendly and helpful. I wish they'd offer a kid-free time to visit.  By the time I left, I had tinnitus from all the noise that kids make. We were here for 5 hours or so.  (I'm not totally anti-children, it's just hard navigating around them in a wheelchair)",Terrifying
"January 1, 2022","We visited the ice rink on New Year’s Eve and really wish we hadn’t! Would suggest because of the mild weather the ice was melting and there was two inches of standing water on the rink, it was too dangerous. I was knocked over backwards by a tall bloke who’d been weaving in and out precariously of other skaters throughout the session. I hit my head and momentarily blacked out. My 12 year old daughter had to call over staff, one of whom said it wasn’t his job to help. When I was finally helped off the ice was seen by a grumpy first aider who seemed more intent on telling off my traumatised daughter for wanting to be with me than in carrying out a proper check over. She checked me for concussion, made me sign a piece of paper and gave me some paracetamol and sent me on my way, totally missing the bleeding gash on the back of my head despite me telling her my head hurt. Poor organisation, poorly trained staff, who all seemed too young to deal with a crisis and poor management to keep the rink open when others had closed because of the weather. Thankfully I was just a walking wounded but dread to think how they would have reacted to a serious injury!",Great dinosaur area
"August 27, 2021","The building in itself is worth the visit and great dinosaur display; the other displays are average, bur nice. The free tickets are impossible to get at short notice, but you can buy a membership that entitles to entry without booking for one year.",family visit
"February 26, 2020",Love this place. Always something new to see and the kids love it every time we go. Always worth a visit. ,Fantastic 
"February 25, 2020",Full of interesting things to look at and learn about with lots of interactive displays. Great for kids and adults alike. ,Wildlife Photographer of the Year - WOW
"February 24, 2020",What a gorgeous museum. Amazing building with truly inspiring specimens. The Wildlife Photographer of the year exhibition is well worth the pounds.,FREE and Fantastic
"February 23, 2020",Kids will love the dinosaur section and there is much for adults to see and learn.Would really recommend!,Love history and good place
"February 23, 2020",I sax there dinosaurus bones with my two kids. They really love that journey and Drrew a lot Wen we came back home. Perfect,"Absolutely crowded, but still a great museum!"
"February 22, 2020","Had to queue in the rain for about 10 minutes - absolutely rammed with visitors. There is so much to see, with such a variety of exhibits, that you really can spend all day there.",Fantastic free day out
"February 20, 2020",We spent 3 hours here. Could have been 3 days. Fantastic exhibitions and explanations of how our world evolved and works,Always a treat
"February 18, 2020",We went in twice for relatively short visits while staying in town. The blue whale makes a great impression and there's always so much to see. Great cakes in the cafeteria too.,Kids (and adults) will love it

"February 15, 2020","Great place, good location and close to public transport with buses stopping nearby & the tube stopping at south Kensington station allowing you to avoid potential foul weather by taking the underground tunnels to the museums. It’s also within minutes walk of cafes & it’s really easy to navigate between exhibits and nearby V&A museum & the science museum.",Ultimate helpers
"August 20, 2020","On our arrival at the museum with my grand daughter, I was totally unable to bring up my emails, and thus my tickets. The assistants ""passed me down the line"" to a younger man. He patiently helped try to obtain access, and when we failed, rang bookings to search for my tickets, which they promptly found, thus saving the day. He then messaged ahead so that we would not be asked for the tickets again. I am ashamed to say I forget his name, but it began with an E. Throughout our visit, nothing was too much trouble for the staff, who answered my 9 year old's questions and queries without demure, and helpfully 'piloted' us on our way. Absolutely top notch!",Top Notch Trip
"August 7, 2020","We (myself, my partner and our five year old son) came to the museum for the re-opening after COVID-19, we pre-booked a time slot ticket in advance online with the children's visitors pack (including a tote bag, a map and a dinosaur themed mask to encourage our son to wear a mask around the museum which he loved!) It was a shame to see people being turned away at the gate as they had not realised you needed a pre-booked ticket, I would think it is obvious because of everything going on, however, maybe more obvious signage on the new ""whalecome back"" posters would have been helpful. The museum was immaculately clean and myself and my partner praised the museum for having staff circulating constantly cleaning the displays and exhibits, also the amount of hand sanitisers around the building made us feel completely at ease. It was wonderful how empty the majority of the building was, most of the displays felt like private exhibits! A lot of the ""hands-on"" activities are closed, which is completely understandable and we were fine with that. One thing I would say, is that later on in the day as the museum got busier, the staff that are circulating should be challenging masks (I completely understand that there are some people that cannot wear a mask, however, whole groups of people were coming into the museum without wearing one, and I would suggest that not every member of these parties are exempt). But also challenge social distancing, it was very frustrating having groups of people barge into us through the museum. Especially children not being watched by their parents! My son has been essentially trained to remember ""special distance"" and he was getting quite upset when other children were coming too close to him when he was trying to look at something and thus, he felt he had to move. I feel staff could be doing more to stop this and to challenge people who were not adhering to the one way system. This was especially bad in the dinosaur exhibit which I would assume is the most popular area of the museum especially for children. Overall, the day was fantastic, it was the first time we had all been around the entire museum (except what was not open, but this was minimal) and we spent nearly five hours exploring. A real day out - I find with museums, you get out of it what you put in!","What a day, go here and love this place"
"August 1, 2020","Fantastic afternoon spent here, exhibits were great and the building as a whole is amazing. I really",Wonderful

"January 30, 2020",If you are in the museum you should visit the exhibition „Wildlife photographer of the year“. The exhibits (wildlife photos) are stunning and quite interesting. It is really worth its money. ,Educational visit
"January 30, 2020",We went as a family with a 3 year old and she loved it. Free entry still which is amazing in the centre of London. Some of the older rooms maybe could do with an update but a brilliant museum  ,Entertaining and interesting
"January 28, 2020",It’s a really good place to spend a morning. Alone or with family and kids it’s perfect and approaches all kind of public. I’d say it’s and essential place to go when visiting London.,Great Museum
"January 27, 2020",You can easily spend the whole day but we had 2 hours ans had to choose between the exhibitions. The building is amazing and the dinasours and whales are one of a kind. The minerals section was also very interesting.,Stunning building
"January 26, 2020",it's worth visiting just to see the architecture of the museum. it's simply breath taking. There are some nice exhibits inside..well worth a visit,Impressive collection
"January 21, 2020","First of all, it is a stunning building. And the exhibitions are huge. Dinosaur section was very well presented, even though we have visited other museums with more impressive collections (e.g. Berlin) but all in all it was a very nice experience.",A lot of useful knowledge on place

"January 16, 2020",My husband suprised me with a trip to London and our first stop on arrival was the natural history museum.

"December 9, 2019","We visited here and had a lovely time, very bright and airy and the displays were very good. The museum was clean and tidy and had an enjoyable experience.",Amazing.
"December 8, 2019","Amazing museum.  So rich in species diversity, from mammals to cnidaria, it has incredible fossils and is extremely important for knowledge and our history.  The human body part is also wonderful and interactive.  The museum also has several cafes and options for breaks and rest.","Way too crowded, many things not on display"
"December 3, 2019","This museum is free, which is fantastic, but you have to pay extra to see things like their  giant squid specimen (which I had been looking forward to). The dino and mammal skeletons are spectacular, but hard to appreciate because the museum was completely packed on a Friday morning. Loads and loads of school trips and tiny babies who should not have been out.",Excellent
"December 2, 2019","I still cannot believe this museum is free of charge.  Our four children ages 4 to 16 loved this museum.  We were impressed with everything it had to offer.  It was perfect day for it as well since it was raining that day, and we were nice and dry inside the museum.",Visit to Natural History Museum
"December 1, 2019",Beautiful architecture both inside and out Colour of stonework very complimentary to the surroundingsInteresting exhibits - we visited for the Wildlife Photographer of the year Some parts of the museum were a little overcrowded - our visit was on a Thursday and as expected some schools were also visiting,Thumbs up for this!
"November 26, 2019",Really enjoyed myself at this museum. Free entry (as usual for museums in London). So many things to see. Especially the whale skeleton(most instagrammable photo op) i guess. Very interesting gift shop. Its near Science Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum too. Walking distance of Harrods too.,Such friendly staff!

"November 25, 2019",This was my third visit to the museum and it was as thrilling as the first time. It covers many topics ranging from earthquakes to dinosaurs. It is suitable for all ages and there's a big emphasis on visualization of the exhibits. Highly recommend! ,Best Day Ever
"November 25, 2019","I had the best Day ever at Natural History Museum. The building was in itself amazing. They had activity books for children, so it's well suited to bring kids (maybe not the youngest ones <4 y/o).I was crying inside of joy the whole time because it was all so great. Dinasours, mammals, gems, minerals, sea shells, creepy creatures, and so on. I had hoped the Human Evolution area had more models of extinct homos/humans tho. We didn't get to see everything on one day, so we will definetely go back!",Best of London
"December 29, 2019","Went here with the family, my 4 year old was all about the dinosaurs, and that was the main reason we went. Fantastic excebition, specially the dinosaurs and the  whales was our favourites. Lunchtime at T-Grill, laim hamburger and crappy service- please choose one of the other kafeterias. VERY nice shops, both Dino-shop and the ordinary shop. Lots of people- even on a weekday in November. ",Wonderful!
"December 29, 2019",We took our 21 month old son to see the dinosaurs for the first time and he was in awe! It was busy (Saturday between Christmas and New Year) but we expected that. If you can go on a weekday during term time you're laughing! Also - go the 'Moon' while it's there...great as a chill out!Paying a £5 donation is nothing compared to the amount you can see in this awesome museum! ,Wonderful architecture and exhibits
"December 26, 2019",We see something different every time we visit. The building itself is a spectacle and the exhibits fascinating. Educational and thrilling. Fabulous place,Unmissable.

"December 23, 2019",Have to say I doubt anyone could enjoy this museum with  the number of people packed in. I certainly did not. We lasted 15 mins and left it was terrible.  It was so crowded that you could not move or read anything. Too many people which honestly should be controlled with timed tickets or maybe charging people. I know that is a terrible thing to say in this country but look at Europe most of the museums cost something to go into.,London Museums are Amazing- Free entry to this place
"December 23, 2019","You need lot of time to explore London attractions, but if get few days then don't miss out museums specifically those where you get free entry. If you love historical things and want to explore natural things, do visit this place. Wheel chair access and lifts are available. ",Wow

"November 25, 2019","These museums are always overwhelming. The dinosaur exhibit is really nice. The animatronic t-rex is really cool. It was very busy, so hard to get around. A free museum, though--you can't complain. The moon exhibition was also really cool and the evolution area always interests me too.",An interesting place to visit for every one.
"November 25, 2019","We visited this place on a Saturday afternoon.  There was a bit of  queue but we didn't have long to wait.  We went first to the Dinosaur section and the first thing you see on the entrance hall is a dinosaur hanging from the ceiling.  They have a couple of working models.  The only thing I wasn't too happy about was having to follow a line via a cordoned off sectipn, but I suppose it stops any  chaos.  There were a lot of families there and most of the children found it exciting.  We also had a look at the room of the moon, which was quite interesting and the bird section and saw Guy.the Gorilla who had died in the late 1970's.  Well worth a visit.on a rainy afernoon. ",Best gift shop for kids!
"November 24, 2019",It is a wonderful Museum that could take days to cover completely. It has several gift shops that have great gifts for kids. Gorgeous building too!,AMAZING........
"November 23, 2019","You don't get much for free in this world, but OMG !!!! If only to look at the building you must go. What a place. There is something to look at from every angle. As for the content.... there is more than enough for you to while away a good 3-4 hours. The exhibitions are amazing and it's good to see that there is always something else in nature that will blow you away. A souvenir brochure was only a fiver and full of glossy pictures. Entry is free and there is opportunity to donate , £5 is recommended and is well worth it. ",One of my favorite musea ever!
"November 23, 2019","This museum is cool, not just for kids but everyone. The collection is HUGE and very impressive. The animals, dinosaurs, mammals, stones, minerals and so much more! It's a very nice way to learn about planet earth and it's animals, what roamed our planet millions of years ago. The only thing that could be better was the mammal part, it felt a bit outdated compared to the rest of the museum. The building itself is absolutely stunishing, beautiful architecture and the ceiling is just WOW! You can easily spend an entire day here if you would like, but also pick different sections of your choice. Like the title said: One of my favorite musea in the world. You must go see this!PS. The Museum of the Moon is REALLY nice!",Fantastic in every way
"November 21, 2019",Take all the family. There isn't enough time in the day to see it all and so kid friendly. Not to be missed.,Simply amazing
"November 20, 2019","It would take to long to write a review on this wonderful place. We spent over four hours looking through history and enjoyed every minute, I would however recommend wearing good comfy shoes.",Take the time to read about the history of this place.
"November 18, 2019","My daughter and I wandered in and spent hours here. The architecture and the history behind it is enough to enchant you and then there are all the displays, the uncovered bones and history behind them, the dinosaurs and exhibits of all sorts of animals. I liked that there was a note on one exhibit that was admittedly looking a little frayed by the many years but that these animals would not be replaced because they no longer believe in killing and mounting the body for display. I really appreciated that so much and found that to be an honorable note to this beautiful museum. Look for the carvings every where of monkeys and birds and other animals in the staircases and beams. There is a Moon display lit up and people were laying on the floor beneath it. It truly was so gorgeous. My daughter and I absolutely loved wandering thru here. ",Really impressed
"November 18, 2019","Took the kids here on a Saturday and they loved it, there is so much to see, you really need 3-4 hours to get around it all.Gets quite busy but wasn't horrendously so.Making a donation is made easy by card or cash when you go in.",Lots and lots to see
"November 18, 2019","This museum offers way more than one can see in a day, maybe even a week. The building is beautiful and the collection enormous and very old. Definitely go here if you're visiting London. One downside, it's usually extremely packed with children. ",Take the time to read about the history of this place.

"November 17, 2019",I have been here for this exhibit the last couple of years. It is truly amazing to walk through so much history and then go for the wild life exhibit. I can recommend this place.,Marvellous day out.
"November 17, 2019",Sooooo much to see and do all under one roof. We spent the whole day in there and didn’t see everything. Leave plenty of time  to visit. ,"Wonderful place to explore and learn, but expect crowds"
"November 17, 2019","Loved the museum, but as with such a large facility, some areas were closed off that I would have loved to explore a bit. A wonderful docent was stationed to help teach more about items that would have been found in one of the areas closed for renovation, which was wonderful. It was both enjoyable and a bit overwhelming how many students where there for fieldtrips, but we anticipated this, given it was mid-week - so if you go, make sure to anticipate that! The credit card system went down about five minutes before we checked out with our items at the gift shop which, clearly wasn't their issue, but just wanted to forewarn others that it may be an intermittent issue as I had read about it happening previously in another review somewhere. All in all, staff were stellar, welcoming and friendly and we enjoyed our self-paced visit. ",Enter into the center of the earth
"November 17, 2019","The escalator takes you into the belly of the earth , thats your entry inrto Natural History which is a wonderful museum well worth the visit. Some galleries have been updated and a few look dated but watching the kids go through was very cool as they were totally taken but low tech and high tech displays . A must visit",Wow
"November 15, 2019",This was my first visit to the London History Museum and I wasn't disappointed.Lots to see and do and educational for children too.The added bonus was admission was free.A must see if visiting London.,Speechless
"November 13, 2019","The building itself, is utterly beautiful, magnificently so. We were moved to tears ( quite literally ) by the sheer beauty of the place.Then on top of that you get the exhibitions! All together a fantastic visit, and it's free, although we gave £10 each. Unparalleled value!",A great flying whale over you
"November 12, 2019",Or at least the skeleton... it’s an impressive collection of natural wonders that varies from the dinosaurs to the moon.Maybe you need a couple of days to really visit all what is there. ,Best museum in the UK by far 
"November 2, 2019","Been coming her since w child and this place never fails to entertain kids and adults alike, beautiful architecture too!",A unique day!!!
"October 31, 2019",Very impressive museum with fascinating exhibits. It was worth it visiting. Excellent for children and adults too.,Amazing 
"October 31, 2019","Won't say too much apart from loads to do, beautiful building, could spend hours there, kids and adults! Loved it.  Easy to get to and so much to see.Highly recommended ","An enormous, well organized, set of 5 collections!"
"October 30, 2019","This world famous ""Natural History"" Museum, highlights ""scientific excellence"", and was established 138 years ago.  It has a collection of about 80 million items, that are divided into 5 different themes/collections-- which will appeal to visitors of all ages.  The Museum (located near 2 other remarkable museums) can be readily reached by public transport (& admission is free).  The Museum has been awarded TripAdvisor's ""Certificate of Excellence"" [based on feedback from travellers like us].  The extensive collection, covering a huge area, is organized into 29 ""galleries"", which are then grouped into 4 main areas (each is ""colour coded"")... so, it would be advisable to think about one's priorities and then, at the information desk, ask where they are located.  In addition to a great gift shop, there are 5 restaurants/cafes--- one of which, T.Rex, is ""Dinosaur themed"".  A visit will be most memorable.I hope that this Review has been helpful.",Full of fascinating things
"October 30, 2019",Interesting exhibits in a beautiful building. Definitely worth a visit - you can spend several hours in here. I was particularly pleasantly surprised by the geology exhibits.,Vienna Nat Hist Museum is FAR better!
"October 30, 2019","Anyone who has been to Vienna Natural History Museum would NOT be amazed by this museum. The entry hall seems rather poor and climbing up and down on the stairs did not make us happy. The vault with gems is amazing though, as well as 4,5 billion y old meteorite!Since my last visit the museum has been upgraded, I liked the apps, teaching kids, bringing them closer to nature!",Really interesting
"October 29, 2019",Love the sculptures and the great historical artifacts.Really a good place to go to have an educational tour.,Much to see
"October 28, 2019",There was a lot of interest here and well displayed. Some of the labels etc needed refreshing as they were looking a bit tired. ,Fun place to visit
"October 27, 2019",This is one of the top natural history museums in the world.  It provides a great educational experience for young and old.,Great Venue
"October 27, 2019","Visited this museum on a Saturday in school holiday time, although it was busy you can still get to see all the exhibits. Exhibits are brilliant well set out and world class. Gift shops were very busy and very expensive but as the site is free it’s expected. Plenty of spots to eat and drink although aim expensive.",Exceptional
"September 22, 2019","What a building, what a place! So much to see and do. Our 6yr old daughter absolutely loved seeing all the various exhibits, particularly the birds, creepy crawlies and of course, the awesome dinosaurs, as did we. A must see place. You could spend hours here. Plenty of places to eat as well. Thoroughly recommended!",Just amazing
"September 22, 2019","Unbelievable. Kids loved it, so much to see, need to go again as didn't have time to absorb everything. Kids were thoroughly engrossed in everything and loved the dinosaur! Can't wait to return (may go without the kids next time ha ha!).",Exciting and eerie at the same time.
"September 21, 2019","When you first enter you will be in ore of the size of some of the subjects, but at the same time you are completely captured with the tour information, it’s gripping.",Mad in the school holidays 
"September 20, 2019",Absolutely rammed on a sunny August day so I cannot imagine what it would be like on a rainy day! Lots to see but slightly ruined by the crowds. Can recommend the picnic area in the basement as it was much quieter than anywhere else and had a little coffee shop too!,Wowowowowowow
"September 19, 2019",A great way to spend a few hours as we did on the last day in London before we went to the airport.  Stunning building and excellent interactive and well presented displays. Easy to get to as the South Kensington Tube Station is very close by,I was expecting way more than what i saw
"September 19, 2019",Its was ok ! Not more than that. There are some exhibition and the entrance is free. I think this museum is more for kids.,Disappointing
"September 18, 2019", Very difficult to navigate around and the so missed areas. Lady in the cafe was so sullen made us feel we were disturbing her just to get served. ,Enough for a whole day!
"September 17, 2019","If you’re planning to visit, I have two tips;1. Make sure you have a whole day free for it! There’s a lot there!2. Don’t go during the school holidays! Me and my girlfriend made that mistake in August! Absolutely heaving! Couldn’t even get round a tiny section without clipping the heals of toddlers and being run over by careless chavvy mums with pushchairs. Probably best if you don’t take much stuff with you because it you want to put it in the cloakroom I’d suggest you take out a mortgage for doing so. Same if you want to use the café. There’s so much to see, and so much to read that you simply can’t take it all in. From rare crystals to dinosaurs (and no I’m not still talking about the clientele!). So much interactivity to enjoy, not just for kids - I learnt so much in the optical illusion section about how your brain sees things for example. So much to see and do and incredible architecture!","A feast for the soul, both young and old"
"September 16, 2019","I haven't been here since I was about the age of my son I was taking (9). I could, in all honesty, remember very little about the place.First impression was the magnificence of the building on approach which is simply stunning. Then, that magical first moment of walking in and seeing the suspended giant skeleton and seeing my son's face. From then on, it was just a magical tour of all things fascinating, with fabulous variation of activities, interactive bits, films and so much more.The Moon exhibit, despite its simplicity, is utterly enchanting.We spent a few hours here in the midst of a busy day's action and could easily have spent much longer.The fact that this spectacular museum, which is better than just about any museum you can name, is free just makes me love the place even more.An essential visit for families.",Well it was a bit dull really and the man on the door was abusive asking for money!
"September 14, 2019",We took some Filipino friends to the natural hisrory meseum but the displays were mostly out of the 1950's and certainly not attuned to an international audience. I felt the man on the door was abusive askign for money in the way he did to what should be a free experience which was frankly shameful. I will not take people there again from abroad.,"Crowded, not much to see, does anyone clean ANYTHING?"
"October 2, 2019","We went during the week in the morning and apparently that was a ""low crowd"" time to visit. I don't know how that can be, but whatever. It was nothing but dozens and dozens of school trips and kids running amok with no supervision whatsoever. You can't actually see or read anything because there are so many people standing in front of whatever you want to look at. I was excited about the dino exhibit--heard it's really good--and i was disappointed to say the least. What's so great about it? There were hardly any fossils in there. It was dark which made it feel even more claustrophobic than it already naturally was. Most of it was reading posters of things that aren't that interesting instead of looking at specimens. The whole one-way road they push you through was irritating. Even if you got to the front of the people crowded around to read something, it wasn't long before you were pushed down the corridor. Whose idea was that?And for the love God, does anyone DUST anything in that museum?? There is literally an inch of dust covering EVERYTHING. The dinosaurs and everything else looked positively FURRY. It was seriously distracting and a disgusting turn-off. This place has been open for over 130 years and nobody has thought to dust your displays even ONCE?? I wouldn't go back to this place if someone paid me. Visit the Cast Court at Victoria & Albert's if you want to see something cool.",Awesome
"October 1, 2019",Amazing place with lots of interesting things for learning. Only downside it that the isn't enough information for people with disabilities  ,Wonderful!
"September 30, 2019","Visited the Natural History Museum with my wife and two kids, 7 and 10 years of age. We all loved the experience. It is free to enter but you are asked to make a donation. The museum is VAST so much so that a full day could be spent here exploring. There is so much to do and see. Couldn't recommend a visit highly enough.",Excellent
"September 29, 2019",We took the grandchildren here for the day. They loved the dinosaurs the best. Good restaurant too with a good selection of sandwiches and cakes.,Best Museum! 
"September 29, 2019",Love coming to this museum as there is so much to see. Staff are always helpful and friendly. We have been here plenty of times and it never gets boring. ,Excellent Museum
"September 28, 2019",Stunning building and well executed content and displays. Dinosaurs and Blue whale where highlights for the kids. Free admission (donation optional) is a bonus.,Amazing 
"September 28, 2019",Amazing and it’s free entrance. It’s great if u have small kids who love animals. So many things to see. ,We all loved it!
"September 28, 2019","Wow, visually everything you see is amazing! My sons 9 and 5 thoroughly enjoyed it especially the younger one. We got there as soon as it opened and some levels we had to ourselves for a short while. You can take your own picnic and go to a designated place to eat it. I wanted to buy a cake but the price £2.90-£3.90, thank goodness I don’t live in London! ",Full day of activities 
"September 28, 2019","If you are looking for something to do check it out as they always have something going on, that caters for different audiences. ",Exciting visit for all of us 
"September 27, 2019","My child loved the dinosaurs section and also the earthquake simulation part.  For us, it was a reinforcement of how many things we can still learn!!!! We can’t wait to go back! People were friendly. The entry was free of charge but you can make a donation if you want. ",Mesmerize visit
"September 4, 2019","One word, Amazing, although I was on a weekend, the amount of people didn't interrupt at all the wonderful visit. Very interesting exhibitions organized in a very clear and easy way to find your way ",Great time 
"September 4, 2019",I visited with my wife and two kids (five and nine) they had a  great time and so did we. It was busy but not too busy. My son really loved the Lego build an alien part which was a free add on ,Very informative 
"September 4, 2019",Great place beautiful building jam packed with information old and new. Something of interest for everyone. Staff are very knowledgeable and helpful. Can't believe there's no admission fee although there are donation boxes which i did contribute too.Great day out its a must place to visit.,Enormous and full of amazing stuff 
"September 3, 2019","Incredible building,  amazing architecture and so full of incredible specimens.  It was very crowded the day we were there with many schools doing end of year trips, so that was a bit challenging at times but couldn't be helped.   Our only issue was the lack of air circulation,   everything was very stuffy so we found ourselves needing to head outside regularly for some fresh air. Would definitely recommend if museums and animals are your thing.",Absolutely brilliant
"September 2, 2019","I can't recommend the natural history museum enough. I took the children during the school summer holidays. It was busy but not overcrowded, we didn't have to queue to get in. There is just so much to see here, we could easily have spent an entire day walking around. The museum itself is immaculate and everything is in great working order, far better than the nearby science museum. I don't think I've ever been to a museum with so many artifacts and so much information about each subject. I would urge people to consider donating to the museum, if they are able to, there are plenty of contactless machines and donation spots. This sort of museum must cost a fortune to run and we're so lucky to be able to visit for free.",Wonderful educational museum
"September 1, 2019","This is a fabulous museum, with incredible displays and interactive opportunities.   Great for all ages.  Only problem is the crowds, at least on the day we visited. (Saturday in August)  One should try for a quieter time.  Old great museum that has been updated.  Well worth the visit.",Best attraction in London
"August 31, 2019",Very interesting and worth it! Great for kids and adults...it is also right next to science museum. That is day out in London right there. ,Surely one of the world's greatest museums
"August 31, 2019","Even if you have no interest in natural history you should at least go and see the building, it's absolutely stunning with, seemingly, every column and block individually designed. My 10 year old daughter adores the place and insists we go every time we come to London to, as a minimum, see Hope the blue whale. Yes, it is very crowded and some of the exhibits are a bit tired and dated but we all still love it.",So much to see ! Great for all ages ! 
"August 31, 2019","Second time visiting this amazing museum  and haven’t been disappointed. Polite and helpful staff, clean and tidy. So much to see and do ! Second time visiting and still not seen it all !! 2 must see areas are Blue Zone ; Dinosaurs and Mammals defiantly a highlight! And Red Zone ; volcanoes/ earthquakes and Human Evolution my highlights of the area! Must see T-Rex, Blue Whale and experience the earthquake room !  Central cafe nice for snakes or cold food but if wanting a meal recommend T-Rex Grill, with great decor! Great accessibility for people who struggle to walk , my mam came with me this time who struggles with osteoarthritis and made her way around fine ☺️Looking forward to my next visit !! ",Excellent museum
"August 30, 2019",Very interesting museum for adults & kids. Get there very early to avoid long queues & wait times to get in.  ,Just ok
"August 4, 2019","Visited the museum with high hopes. I found it to be much more geared toward children than I would have expected. The moon exhibit offered almost nothing to see and the biology section felt too much like a 5th grade exhibition. When we left here, we went to the science museum, which is close by. I’d recommend that museum over this one. Though I’m sure that small kids would love this one. ",The Best Museum I’ve Ever Visited in London!
"August 4, 2019",You can easily get to the museum by underground and it looks gorgeous inside and out)) It was a great experience. I spent almost the whole day in this fascinating place and it was excellent! The exhibitions are breathtaking and very educative. I learned a lot and if possible I would visit this place again)),Simply the best
"August 4, 2019",Quite simply the best museum in the world. Yes a lot of the artefacts were stolen by the Empire and brought back to England but that’s the same in most great museums...From Dinosaurs to Egyptian Mummies and everything in between...   too much to ever see in a day (especially with young kids) but well worth taking time to explore.,Extremely busy but fascinating 
"August 3, 2019","We went in the school holidays so it was a bit of a nightmare. The displays were good, when you could get to them and it covered so many subjects that there would definitely be something for everyone. I would go again but only during a quiet period. The building itself is beautiful inside and out and worth visiting in itself. ",One Should Always Take In This Museum
"August 3, 2019","The displays are rather dated and not too pertinent. It would have been nice to have more information on climate change to better educate the public. We also went there to learn about the reintroduction of wolves and did not find one word on the subject. They had stuffed pangolins, but not one word on their endamgerment or the threats to most large mammals and birds the world over. They are missing a large opportunity. There was an interesting section on earthquakes and volcanoes.","Brilliant for all ages, and FREE"
"August 3, 2019","We visited on a very wet day, so it seemed as though all London had decided to do the same.  However, my husband, myself and our 10 year old granddaughter thoroughly enjoyed the day. The beautiful big hall is always awe-inspiring. And what tops it all, there is no entrance fee.  Its up to individuals to make a donation.",Fantastic and Free
"August 3, 2019","Amazing place to visit particularly with children. So much to see and do, you could spend the whole day there. Entry is free but they welcome donations. Definitely visit the dinosaur exhibition - my young children loved it.",Beautiful building and fascinating exhibits
"August 2, 2019","We only had a couple of hours available, so it was a bit of a whirlwind visit unfortunately. Dinosaur fossils are always interesting and this was no exception. Walking through the history of the earth was great. Some of the more closed in areas were uncomfortably stuffy on a warm day as it was when we visited.",Beautiful place!
"August 2, 2019","Huge and wonderful place with many details of items and animals. Good to go with family, place of much learning!",Quality Exhibits ... and it’s Free!
"August 2, 2019","The Natural History Museum has an excellent dinosaur fossils exhibit in addition to plants, mammals and mineralogy.It’s very family friendly, easy to get to and also had outdoor exhibits which are a great way to escape the crowds inside!There are also multiple cafes on-sight which are useful because you could easily spend a day here.There are also multiple cafes, restaurants and  coffee shops across Cromwell.",One word - Amazing
"August 18, 2019","In my opinion this is one of the best places to visit in London. It’s great for young and old and everyone can take away so egy from here. From architecture of the building to the amazing displays.And what is most amazing, entry is free.You simply must visit.",Interesting place to visit.
"August 17, 2019","An amazing place to visit, full of interesting and unusual things to look at. Very clean and staff very friendly and welcoming. Allow a good 3 hours to explore, gets very busy especially when it's raining...allow extra time.",Amazing place but just SO busy
"August 17, 2019","Came here on a wet Friday afternoon with my wife and 2 kids (10 and 13) so it was SO very busy. Point one - use the side entrance. When the main entrance has massive queues, go to the side entrance because the queues are so much smaller!!It's great that the museum is free but it makes for a packed museum. We got about 90 minutes to walk around. Went to see the dinosaurs and the moon exhibit as well as wander around a few of the other exhibits. Would have liked more time but it was just not to be.Had a drink in a cafe (be warned - the baguettes were nearly £8 each!!) then headed off again. This really is a wonderful museum bit it suffers for its' popularity and free entry which means you are constantly fighting with the sheer number of people there.",Dull
"August 16, 2019","I had high expectations for this as it’s such a popular attraction but as a young couple 24/25 we found it rather dull. There was a lot of information to be read, I think it would’ve been a lot more interesting if there had been interactive activities throughout.",Fantastic free museum
"August 16, 2019","We have visited this museum many times over the years,but there is always something new to discover. Lots to see and do for all ages. the queing to get in can be tedious depending on the time of day you visit. Close to underground stations and other museums.",Overwhelming!
"August 16, 2019","  I'm not sure where to begin.  This was the largest museum I've ever gone to.  There was art work from every one of the greatest artists that I've only heard of.  You could easily spend a few days here, if you have time!  Most of the museums in London are free, so cost is not a factor.  I would definitely be back in the future to see what I missed",Just wow
"August 15, 2019","I spent the evening at the NHM celebrating a wedding and without a doubt, the venue made the event what it is. The grand hall which we were situated in was absolutely beautiful where the scenic view such as the remnants of the dinosaur was something I just couldn’t take my eyes off. A great event and an exceedingly fantastic venue. ",One Amazing Museum!!
"August 15, 2019",We visited here recently and were amazed at the sheer size of the building and the number of things that were inside this fantastic museum. I loved every moment of it. This is perfect also as a rainy day activity for families. We look forward to coming again soon. ,Loads to see and it’s free!!!
"August 14, 2019",We all love this museum!  We went there for the Moon exhibition mainly but we also visited the other halls.  My children (4 & 9) love the animals and dinosaurs especially fascinated by their skeletons.  My elder one also likes the information and detail on earthquakes and volcanoes as she learnt them from school in the past academic year!The cafe we visited had yummy food which is reasonably priced given it’s in the museum.,One of the Best
"August 14, 2019","Free museum it's best to make sure you get there early, as it does get crowed. Make sure to see the museum of the moom. The whale skeleton had the little one' really talking. Young kids really love the museum.",A must see for history buffs

"July 24, 2019","FREE ADMISSION. Fantastic, but they do recommend a fiver donation which is well worth the price. So much to see and do. Well worth the visit.",nothing to say but excellent

"July 21, 2019",Great visit and its free too but you can donate which is a must for such a beautiful building with such  amazing interesting features .Well worth a visit,Great museum for adolescent kids to visit
"July 21, 2019","My boys (11 and 14 years) really enjoyed this museum. There was plenty to look, do and touch while there. We spent a few hours looking through the many exhibits.",Nothing Special
"July 21, 2019","When hearing how close the museum was to our hotel, my daughter was excited. She was under the impression that it was one of the best museums in the world. It is massive and has alot to discover but my daughter was disappointed.  It was so crowded you could barely walk through, and it was mostly all animals.  Our biggest complaint was how unorganized and hard to get around it was. It was like a maze and everything was far apart and not easy to navigate. Perhaps our perspective was tainted by how many people were there or that we have an incredible museum back in the US at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.",Awesome
"July 21, 2019","Even if you do not have children, it is a awesome museum to visit in London. It is free and you should go there even if you have only a couple of hours.",Incredible
"July 20, 2019","The architecture of the building alone is worth the visit, both inside and out! Inside you'll find very impressive exhibits on multiple levels. So many aspects of the natural world are displayed and explained here. I move pretty quickly through museums, but one could spend hours and hours here. There's also a nice cafe inside for a cup of coffee or tea and a bite to eat.",Great exhibits
"July 20, 2019","A beautiful building showcasing some lovely exhibits that bring learning to life for kids and adults.  There’s  something for everyone here displays of mammals, minerals, human biology, dinosaurs and more.  Great if you need to escape the rain.",Adventure 
"July 20, 2019",Great place for the kids and adults alike. Many exhibits to peak anyone’s interest.  Dinosaur delights. Lift the moon. See giant ancient bugs. It’s there and it’s free. Go and enjoy,Dinosaur
"July 19, 2019","This is a public museum in South Kensington. It’s completely for free !It’s my favorite museum on rainy days in London. You can see there a lot of skeletons from dinosaurs with great explanations.Unfortunately the biggest and well known dinosaur skeleton at the entrance is missing until 2020, now there is a big fish skeleton in the entrance hall. Nice, too, but not as spectacular as the other one.Children like this museum, too.You can see so many different animals from former days, you will come more than once.The picture shows the entrance hall with the actual whale skeleton.",Good but in need of an update
"July 17, 2019","The museum certainly has the volume and quality of exhibits to entertain everyone but is in clear need of an update. For example, most of the video exhibits were filmed in the 80s, many of the interactive exhibits were either non-functional or only partially functional and I suspect given their age some of the exhibits’ science and theory needs to be updated with the latest knowledge. There’s other similar museums in the world that have probably gone past this one in terms of quality, so if you’ve seen any of those previously this museum can be put on the ‘possible’ list rather than the ‘must-do’ list.",Impressive ! Incredible ! Informative and educational ....
"July 17, 2019","... and Free ! this is a must if you love the natural history of life. The work and skilled staff have dedicated hours of their lives to give an incredible insight to the history of nature. I particularly enjoyed Chi Chi the Panda, I would never have the chance to see him, the main section featuring aqua land and flight is memorable, Thanks London.",An interesting visit
"July 16, 2019",I came here with my grown up son.  I found the exhibits interesting although perhaps the idea of stuffed animal displays is a little old fashioned?  However there are several newer exhibits which look at the earth and climate change for example.  These were excellent and we learned a lot.  We also ate in the cafe and the food was great.,Not enough interactivity 
"July 16, 2019",Stuffed with stuff and lots of info but lacking in interaction for kids education. In midst of dinosaur display under 10 said they were bored. Needs more dynamic things.,Best in the world
"July 16, 2019",Best collection of natural history stuff from gem stones to animals to Darwin's findings. It's amazing and it's free entry!,Is that my mother in Law?
"July 14, 2019","Of course Not,   the dinos just aren't as scaryIf you need to feel engaged with nature ] start here ,  ging back hundreds of milliosnof years with the minute creastures which roamed earth to the biggest,  all in one buildingMind boggling stunning",Incredible experience

"June 14, 2019","We went on a Friday morning / Afternoon hoping it would be quieter than some of the reviews on here seem to mention. It was very busy but manageable and we managed to find a 1/2 hour peace in the cocoon also. I would imagine it is quite crazy on weekends being free but it has to be seen. we spent a good 4 or 5 hours in here and still didn't see everything, Just WOW!",Pretty amazing building with lots to see and do for all ages
"June 13, 2019","We happened to have an open 1/2 day during our London trip and walked by to find out we could jump right in and enjoy the dinosaur exhibit, natural history and more!",Every child...

"June 11, 2019","If they are still running this and you have a chance to go (and are interested in CSI type activities), this is a MUST DO.  They organized and managed this beautifully - from the facts of the case to the interactive learning sessions with museum experts in various forensic sciences.  It was a fantastic evening out.",Another gem
"June 10, 2019","Huge collection of fossils, minerals, taxidermy and all manners of objects from the natural world. One could easily spend a whole day at the museum. The Dodo bird and Archaeopteryx is definitely a highlight.One note of caution - the museum gets **incredibly** busy on a bank holiday.",True museum experience
"June 10, 2019","We have never been to such a detailed history museum. The facts and features were amazing and gave such an up close feel. A few hands on activities but a little antique to today’s technology. All exhibits are visually stimulating and a lot to take in. The dinosaurs and mammals exhibit were our kids, 6 and 7 years, favorite. ",Interesting!!!!
"June 9, 2019","This is a good place to go if you have lots of time, there are some great exhibitions and lots of interactive things to do!!&",Educational
"June 9, 2019","Wonderful museum to rouse kids curiousity. From dinosaurs, to mammals to minerals, lots for both adults and kids to learn from ",Always Free and a sight to see. Take your time and come several times.
"June 9, 2019","Loved bumping into this on our walk from Kensigton Palace to the Harrod's area. It's a great museum filled with treasures you'll never see anywhere else. A beautifully designed and awe inspiring whale of a lobby greets you. Kids would have loved to come, will bring them next time and I'll actually enjoy it, too! ",Interesting and Crowded
"May 17, 2019","A beautiful structure filled with interesting exhibits.  You are greeted by the skeleton of a blue whale upon entry.  The dinosaur exhibit is short, but well done.  My favorite was the Marine portion with the models of the various creatures.  My negatives mainly involved the crowds of school children that ran amuck.  Loud and choatic, it lessened my enjoyment.  Also, the staff was few and always involved, which made it difficult to ask any questions.  Overall good experience.",Beautiful Building
"May 17, 2019",This building always looks amazing and inviting from the outside but once you get inside there is so much to see.  Amazing pieces of history preserved for us all to enjoy.,Amazing museum
"May 16, 2019",My cousin went to London and I took him went to the museum and it was amazing. I had a photo in a ginormous dinosaur skeleton but I couldn’t find it in my gallery to post it here but it was like 8 years ago though but an absolutely great experience during my stay in London.,So much to see
"May 15, 2019",The building is beautiful. The architecture is amazing. Inside there is so much to see. The dinosaur exhibit was our favorite. The gem exhibit is insane. We actually quit looking halfway through my eyes were crossed. The museum is free but they do ask for a £5 donation. For a family of 4 that is a great price. It's a must see. ,A must
"May 15, 2019","Just come enjoy some  houres. See dinasours, bluewhale  ( realy big) . How the world Was made . Set off 3 houres at least.",Not to be missed with chidren

"May 13, 2019","The building itself is beautiful and inside is just as amazing. So many exhibits to see and keeps the whole family entertained.We also were lucky enough to be there when the ice skating rink opened, great fun.",Cant Be Beaten
"May 12, 2019","Took a 4 yr old , it was quite busy and we limited our time there but it was excellent , if you are in town with time to spare its way worth it , dinosaur exhibit alone is good enough !!",Quick visit 
"May 11, 2019",Whether you have time to visit the museum floor by floor and room by room or just have a quick look on the first floor you’re bound to be astonished.,Truely amazing place.
"May 10, 2019",Truely amazing place to visit if you like crowds. It was the weekend though so it should be busy. A must see buT allow plenty of time to look around.,Unparalleled!
"May 21, 2019","The best of its kind. A stunning building with countless exhibits right in the centre of London. Make sure that you plan your visit beforehand due to its sheer size. You will need two, maybe three visits in order to properly explore it. ",Great place to see
"May 20, 2019",It's a fantastic place to visit. So much to see. Plenty of things to see. Just bring your food because it is really expensive! It's easy to get to and with free entrance it's a must see in London. Plan for a crowd if you go on the weekend.,Dino Snores Night Stay
"May 20, 2019","Well sleeping in the Natural History Museum wasn’t in our bucket list but it should have been! We went for a friends 50th (never too old - we are all big kids). What a fantastically organised event. Fabulous evening meal and breakfast, amazing science talk, comedian and lots of other events. Wandering around the museum until 3am was amazing especially the dinosaur gallery on our own in the dark! We all ‘slept’ under the blue whale and viewed the beautiful ceiling whilst in our sleeping bags. AMAZING - just do it!!",amazing
"May 20, 2019","the building itself is amazingvery good for family, provide a lot of knowledge of every side of life you can imagine",Fun With Dinosaurs
"May 19, 2019",We were lucky to be able to visit outside of the school holidays/weekend before our four-year-old starts school and thus avoided anything resembling a queue or a crowd. She absolutely loved the dinosaurs - what child doesn’t! - both being scared and loving the animatronic T-Rex and having the chance to see the skeletons of the other dinosaurs as well. The Triceratops was a definite favourite. We were able to spend a very happy hour with just the dinosaurs and I’m sure all the other rooms would have been just as successful. A great way to spend some time with young children. ,"Amazing museum, difficult access on a rainy day!"
"May 19, 2019",The museum is fantastic - and incredibly it is free. There is only one entrance they keep open though and you have a long walk around the block and past the ice ring so very difficult for elderly folk or those carrying kids!,Busy - But Must See
"May 19, 2019",This museum is free to all - Maybe that’s why it is so busy.  A must visit and glad that I did have the opportunity to visit. Plan for a crowd if you go on the weekend. ,Disappointing visit
"May 19, 2019","The Natural History Museum felt tired & dated, & didn’t feel like somewhere we wanted to continue to explore. Lighting in the galleries was dark, cases were old fashioned & labels were difficult to read - definitely in need of refurbishment.",Cannot believe this place is free. Of you visit please donate!
"May 28, 2019",Wow. What an absolutely amazing place. The exhibits are some of the best in the world. National treasures. A definite must visit. But be warned it gets so busy! Get there early! ,Don't miss it
"May 28, 2019","A fab trip into our past. It took a while to get in, so buy tickets in advance. We visit it previously, but we had to show it to our kids and fiancée. It can't be missed if you are coming to London !",Wonderful exhibits
"May 28, 2019","A well done museum.  Not to be missed on any London trip.  Perfect setting, perfect displays.  Crowded with school children during the week...can be a bit noisy. ",Fantastic
"May 28, 2019","No matter how many times I come here, it is still an amazing experience! It is easy to find; fully signposted from South Kensington tube station. Despite visiting on a saturday, there were no queues to get in. It still amazes me that a visit here is completely free (although there are chances to contribute if you wish). It was my first visit with my niece aged 8 and it was lovely to see her enjoying the experience. The dinosaur exhibit will always be my favourite part (I do miss dippy in the main entrance area). The interactive elements here are great and the anamatronics definately add to the experience. There is so much to learn and it is done in a really interesting way. The mammals section is also really good. Not as interactive as the dinosaur section but still interesting, even if some of the specimens do look a bit gruesome! My other favourite section was the human biology section. Again, fascinating and fun. My niece loved the drawing activity we found. We visited one gift shop which had a good range of items. We did not buy food or drink there; only because we were pushed for time.There is much more to see than you might think. We were there for about 2 hours and it was not long enough. We did not get to see everything and we could have spent much longer there. This is a unique experience that I look forward to repeating.",Dinosaurs
"May 28, 2019",Possibly one of the few museums that has dinosaurs fossils. Some displays are old but still a fun visit especially if you have kids. ,Great Place - Just Far Too Busy!
"May 27, 2019","Lots to see, but just far too many people. We did visit at a peak time so certainly won't complain about it as it was our fault, however it did dampen the experience.If you're in to natural history, then you will like this place! If you don't you won't - Can't really say much more than that!",Awesome museum!
"May 27, 2019",The Natural History Museum is one of the best museums in london if you like to see animals and natural history. The building is also really beautiful! I would recommend going to this museum when in London!,Best museum in London 
"May 27, 2019",This is actually the most entertaining museum in London. Who doesn’t enjoy seeing the dinosaurs?! Highly recommend it,Bank holiday visit 
"May 27, 2019","We arrived at opening time and were in a massive queue but this moved quickly and we were in within 10 minutes. Thought it might be really busy but it’s so spacious inside. It was much bigger than we thought and we were there a good 3-4 hours including lunch. Interactive centre for kids was good where children can explore fossils and loved the interactive things in the human bit. Can’t comment on the dinosaur bit as my daughter was too scared to go in there! Lovely food in Trex grill and reasonably priced! Would recommend getting a kids souvenir book when you go in, my daughter loved finding the parts in the book that she could see in the museum and comes with a map!! One of the best attractions to visit in London!","Busy Place!  Amazing entrance, front and side."
"May 27, 2019","It is a very popular place. Weekdays probably are calmer.  Whether you enter from the front or the side, you will be impressed.  So much to see. Take in as much as you can. Then step outside in the garden area for some fresh air and back in to see what you missed.  This is free by donation. The Victoria and Albert Museum is almost next door and Harrod's is a short walk.",So much to see
"May 18, 2019","This museum was very interesting.  The amount of taxidermy was good, some of them looked very old.  The dinosaur exhibit was very informative. ",A Great Museum in London
"May 17, 2019",This is a great museum to visit in London even if it is filled with children on school trips. Compared to the one in New York I love the second better but I did love the geology exhibit in this museum. ,Natural History Museum
"May 10, 2019","The Natural History Museum was a place I had wanted to visit for quite a while. The building itself is beautiful with intricate stone carvings everywhere you look both inside and out. The collection inside is vast and, I believe, impossible to see in just one visit. Since there is no admission fee there are no line-ups to get in. The ₤1 cost for the map is well worth the price and the colour photo book is also a lovely souvenir of the place. While there were many people there it was easy to get around and to see the exhibits. The animatronic dinosaurs are a big hit with both the children and adults. The displayed are well laid out and clearly labelled. I was only able to see the dinosaurs and mammals exhibits but I do hope to go back sometime and see more. A very enjoyable visit.",Natural history museum 
"May 10, 2019",What an amazing place so much to see and learn about from dinosaurs to gem stones  meteorites and the huge whale skeleton suspend from the roof as you walk in best of all its free entry. ,Interesting Museum
"May 10, 2019",The visit to the museum was brilliant. I would highly recommend every one to visit the museum. And the best part is that the entry to the museum is free of charge.Enjoy!!,Treat 
"May 10, 2019","Visited on a busy Thursday.  Very crowded as expected.  Free entry but has voluntary donation boxes. So much to see will be returning for another visit in the future.  Gift shops rather expensive.  Particularly enjoyed the dinosaurs but no ""Dippy"" on show. Animations were excellent especially the TRex. The museum is divided into Zones and there's clear information about what's in each one. Staff appeared friendly and knowledgeable keen to help. Enjoyed the Red zone learning about the earth and volcanoes and geological processes.  Lots of hand on things to entertain and educate people of all ages. Need more than one visit as so much to see and read. Didn't manage to visit some zones at all. ",Amazing... very special place
"May 9, 2019",The building alone is mind blowing.So much to see you cant absorb it all.The main hall is just amazing.,Interesting!
"May 8, 2019",Nice museum to take refuge from the rainy days of London ! :) Very new facilities and good location. ,Superb exhibits and free to enter
"May 8, 2019","The only downside is that it was absolutely, critically PACKED full of people and you can't get near much.  This isn't their fault however and the quality of the exhibits deserve it a 5 star review.  The building is magnificent as well.",A must see in London
"May 8, 2019","Not just dinosaurs, but the story of our galaxy and planet and a warning about what is going to happen if we don't take care of it.The building is itself an art piece.",BIG and AWESOME
"May 8, 2019","There are lot to see in this Museum . Right from the Crawling creatures to Dinosaur . One can see rich history about all the living beings, fossils and Space. There are rides which one can experience.You need entire day and best part its free to visit which makes entire day event to have fun and to gain knowledge. ",No 1 place to see in London
"May 8, 2019","This place is just the best. Don;t forget to leave a generous donation to help keep this place going. My one recommmendation if you are going with kids is not to try and see everything. It's just too big and they'll get overloaded. Pick a few spots and have a good look at them and leave the rest. My highlights include the giant tree sample upstairs in the main room, the dinosaur exhibition and the geology samples",Good day out in a wonderful museum
"April 23, 2019",This is a free museum in a beautiful building. Donation is highly suggested to help them maintain the museum. Kids and parents can enjoy themselves and spend 3-4 hours here. There is a lot of tourist but the place is big enough to accommodate. ,Much better than expected
"April 23, 2019","After the V&A museum, it's difficult to be impressed when you visit a museum on the same day. After a very disappointing visit at the Science Museum, we didn't have high hopes on this one....but we were wrong!!!It's beautifully laid-out with lot's of (pre historical) animals.The building itself is very beautiful.",Magnificent!
"April 23, 2019",You would seeReal Stagosaurus skeletonsReal T-Rex skeletonsReal stuffed Dodo birdsReal stuffed HumingbirdThe biggest bird egg shield that bigger than the ostrich’sReal giant whale skeletons!!!,A little crowded but great museum 
"April 22, 2019","This is a very large museum of natural history. We really enjoyed not only the exhibits but the exterior architecture and interior design. If you like natural history, definitely check it out! The only downside is we went at a very busy time of day so it was quite crowded. Other than that, it was a great experience. Try to aim for off peak times and weekdays instead of weekends. ",They need to cap visitor numbers
"April 22, 2019","We visited over Easter weekend (next time I'll check the dates before booking a trip) and the entire visit was horrible. It was that busy we could barely move. The lines.for the bathrooms were out the doors (literally). I dread the thought of a fire or incident requiring evacuation because it would have been impossible. Regardless, we went to see the dinosaurs as it is reported that this is one of the top five dinosaur museums in the world.... I have zero idea how it got the rating. It didn't help that it was beyond crowded, there were barely any dinosaurs to see. There was mostly dividers to keep the flow of the crowd going but it was filled with facts for three year olds, opposed to dinosaur enthusiasts. There was nearly nothing to look at as the casts were quite high up you were unable view them / the dividers were blocking the view. We left immediately after viewing the dinosaur section and therefore cannot comment on the remainder of the museum. If you are however a dinosaur enthusiast and want to attend this museum for that sole purpose, I wouldn't bother. ","The other ""not to miss"" museum"
"April 21, 2019","Thank you London for these free museums! I loved all of them! This is one of those you can't miss, but beware the crowds: get there ASAP!",Amazing Collection
"April 21, 2019","A great place to get the geek on and learn about life before human habitation.Amazing collection of fossils and gems  , stand out being the fossil reptile collection and also the hominid displays , showing human evolution .Excellent place to spend at least 3 to 4 hours.","Fantastic, spend the whole day there"
"April 21, 2019",We arrived at 10am and left at 5:30pm.  Our two boys aged 11 and 12 really enjoyed the whole museum.  There favourite was the dinosaur exhibition and the history of earth.We also paid to see the Photographer of the year which was very good and well presented.Left NHM with our heads full of new knowledge and with sore feet!,Half day visit 
"April 20, 2019","This is an amazing museum with so much to see and do. One of London’s favourite!We visited over school holidays, it took us about 10 minutes on a queue to get in. Sadly, the dinosaur exhibit was very crowed and people were a bit pushy and there were also lots of people with pushchairs, which made it even harder to get around. It would be nice to have some kind of crowd control so it does not spoil anyone’s visit. Entrance is free of charge but they ask people for donations.There are donation boxes and card machines  where you can donate as much as you like. It also looks like the some objects could do with some dusting and some interactive machines were not working. Overall, it is a great place to visit and we will definitely come back again some day. ",Whale of A Time
"April 19, 2019","The blue whale that hangs from the ceiling is awesome.  Great family friendly place.  Lots, and lots to see and do.  Nice gift shop if you are looking for gifts or something for yourself.  Loved the marble statute of Darwin.  Be sure to visit the mineral section on the 2nd floor.  Some amazing specimens. Couple of minutes walking distance from the V&A Museum.  Nice way to spend the day between the two museums.",Impressive
"March 5, 2019",Wonderful museum. Very big.Interesting for adults and children.Absolutely free and served by a close underground,Just ok for us
"March 4, 2019","We visited this museum and were fortunate to compare with similar museums from other parts of the world. While the info is properly displayed, I found the overall to lack that attraction factor. The collections were not as rich as we expected and a few areas were really dark. Just ok for us.",History for free!
"March 4, 2019",This is the place of my childhood I remember vividly my first visit and its still one of my favourite museums in the world. The collections in her will blow your mind and if you take your kids theirs too. I saw so many gasps and wide eyed surprises round every corner. Plus the building itself is just so glorious.,Natural History Museum

"March 3, 2019",A wonderful museum to visit time and again! Can be busy and noisy... But so many animals to be seen! T Rex and the palaeontology section is obviously to be seen but do not ignore the rest ! Come back if you do not have enough time !!,Busy but good

"March 3, 2019",Definitely worth of going to watch the best wildlife photographers of the world works. Best time for family with children is weekend or adults during the week.,A cathedral to nature
"March 1, 2019","Wonderful place and so interesting.  The building exterior looks fantastic with its interesting blue and pastel faded bricks, the interior is more so.  I didn't realise but this was the first museum or 'collection' that was open to the general public.  Prior to that all exhibits were only for the eyes of selected guests and wealthy sponsors.  In his own words, Richard Owen, the creator of the Natural History Museum has truly built a 'Cathedral to nature'.  Sadly his statue which used to occupy the central position in the main hall has been replaced by the better known Sir Charles Darwin.  It was lovely to see so many well-behaved school parties drinking in the information and experience.",Extremely busy
"February 25, 2019",South Kensington underground exit brings you right to the door of the museum. It is free to enter but it has to be an one of the most crowded museums I have ever been to.Even though it was a mid week visit it wasn’t easy to see many of 5he wonderful exhibits. I would though take five minutes and consider if you really want to pay the extra for the display of nocturnal animals. Personally we didn’t think it was worth it having seen very similar displays for free in other museums.,Half term visit with 5yo
"February 23, 2019","We had a very nice time here. There was lots to see and do,  but children may be bored after a few hours. There was plenty of information on hand for adults, and lots of interactive things for kids to enjoy. Some of these were out of order, which was a bit disappointing but there were plenty of alternatives. There were plenty of cafes and toilets, though the cafes were a little expensive. The gift shop was reasonably priced though. We got there relatively early so did not have to queue for long, but by lunchtime the queues were very long. We struggled a bit finding our way around the museum, as the ‘zone’ maps were a bit confusing, and you often had to walk through exhibits to get to others, which we weren’t expecting. The displays were very well thought out and I could have spent much longer in a few of them, my son enjoyed the earthquake experience especially.A very nice way to keep children and adults interested and occupied during the holidays.",My Fiance's Birthday
"March 17, 2019","So, me and my fiance were in London for her birthday, i thought it would be sweet to take her to the museums as I knew there was a butterfly exhibit on.That was absolutely amazing! However...the rest of the Museum...wasnt to my expectations. I genuinely feel the Manchester Museum had more to offer. There was hardly any exhibits, it was difficult to navigate and the food prices were...yikes.However the butterfly exhibit was beautiful and well worth the money.",Wildlife Photography extravanganza
"March 16, 2019","Such an amazing exhibition. A family of teenagers, parents and grandparents. We had prebooked the tickets so had direct access and did not have to join the entry queue outside as being half term was busy. Exhibition on for a while yet - quite fantastic. ",Busy at half term but we keep returning
"March 15, 2019",My son and I regulary return to the history museum purely because he has a keen interest in Space and there is an entire area focused on this. Will return again no doubt. ,Must-visit for families

"March 7, 2019","The building itself was absolutely incredible, inside & out. The museum was packed when I went around 4:45p, but the exhibits that I saw were interesting ",Amazing 
"March 6, 2019",I was so excited to visit and the place didn’t disappoint. Just amazing setup very engaging grabs your interest. The dinosaur exhibit was a little crushed to many people for anyone to have a real good look. The only downside was the toilets in the basement area/ picnic room where horrible. Through over use I would say. They were either blocked up with loo roll or just in need of tlc. ,Great museum 
"March 6, 2019","I have to say had been looking forward to visiting the museum for a long time and was excited to go. Now we didn't get round a lot of the museum but have to say the areas we did see were fascinating, so left more to see on our next visit. ",Amazing and a Definite Place to Visit if in London
"March 5, 2019",Went here while on business in London. Stopped first to enjoy the museum which was absolutely wonderful. The building itself is like being in Hogwarts from Harry Potter movies. The displays are large and quite impressionable. We also had an evening function here after the Museum closed. Quite a location for special events. No need to do much decorating as the museum itself if amazing. The staff were also wonderful and quite accommodating for the evening celebration.,Never disappoints
"March 30, 2019","We have been here every London visit and it never disappoints!The galleries are well kept and well managed, the collection is massive and the changing exhibitions are really interesting.The cafe is decent too.A perfect day out, especially since you can go have lunch in Wagamama in high St Kensington, few minutes away, do a little shopping and then to back in for another round in the afternoon!

The whole experience was magical, we were able to explore the Wildlife Photographer of the Year before the film started - which was incredible. The film was presented in the main hall and we were seat directly underneath the blue whale skeleton. As I love the film already I got engrossed and forgot there was a massive skeleton above my head, making me jump a few times. The environment definitely made the film more tense and spectacular. The event was organised with plenty of staff from the entrance, being seated and leaving. There was refreshments and complimentary popcorn, highly recommend and we can’t wait to book our next event with Luna Cinema - Jaws in water dinghy?",Excellent!
"March 25, 2019",truly enjoyable so much to see. at every turn we were amazed.  it's immense.  great for picture taking if you don't use flash.  so much historical information and fascinating items of antiquity.  you'll love it.,Nice Enough 
"March 24, 2019",We decided to give this place a try and we really enjoyed it especially because it is free. There are a large number of impressive exhibitions from birds to dinosaurs so it is a good few hours worth of entertainment. I would recommend this place to visit if you are coming to London as it's certainly an experience you won't forget however there are a few things to consider before you go:1. If you want to feel like school sports day this is the place for you because there are children charging around all over the place to the point where I'm sure I shoulder barged some where they ran into me and bounced off because they weren't looking where they were going. So something needs to be done about the number of people they allow in. 2. The cafe/restaurant is quite poor with limited numbers of tables. The table we sat at was very wonky and I had a lovely shower of breakfast tea on my leg when my girlfriend picked up her coffee. So they need to sort this out. Other than these points it's well worth a visit. ,Must see if you are in London
"March 22, 2019","An amazing place to go to. It is so amazing that they have preserved so much so beautifully. The entry to the museum is free.The map guide to the museum costs 1 pound.There are various zones for dinosaurs, mammals, creepy crawlers, birds, earth, marine animals.There are a couple of restaurants within the museum.There are three souvenir shops within the museum.The dinosaur section is very interesting for kids. It's an absolute treat to see.MUST SEE IF YOU ARE IN LONDON. overall ratings 5/5",Amazing
"March 22, 2019",This was my first time here & will need to go back as its so massive there isnt time to see everything properly,"An enormous museum, rooms of exhibits."
"March 19, 2019","It was a Saturday afternoon, it was school holidays, most of London was crowded into this museum, had to fight my way around to see anything. Did not enjoy!!",Well worth a Visit 
"March 19, 2019","A very well organised set up, can be very busy with visiting school parties,however a very pleasant half day",Very busy
"December 11, 2018",Should have realised school holiday. In school half term DO NOT use South Kensington station. Use nearby Gloucester rd station instead only a min or two further to walk but well worth hassle of battling with horrendously overcrowded South Kensington,History come to life
"December 9, 2018","We specifically went there with the sole purpose of viewing the Mary Anning fossil.  Most of us read the book ""Remarkable Creatures"" by Tracy Chevalier.  There was an actress playing the part of Mary which added to the experience.  There was so much to see at this museum, we did not have the time to do this museum justice. Perhaps our next trip to London. ","Lines are terrible, the museum is fantastic"
"December 3, 2018","Mostly everything is in the title: Lines are terrible, the museum is fantastic. Try to go either early in the morning or after 2pm when the lines are not that long",Lots of fun
"December 3, 2018",We arrived 5 minutes before the doors open and there was a huge queue but when it got to 10am it moved really fast. I thought there would be a bag search and more security but there wasn’t. It’s donations & no charge for the museum so we put £5 in for about an hours visit. Lots to see and the ice skating/carousel made it feel nice and Christmassy ,Children and Adults love it
"December 3, 2018",Still one of the best things to do in London if you have a spare day.Amazing things to see and even if you have been before you always find something you may have missed previously.,Always great
"December 1, 2018",Called in when in the area. This has always been my favourite London museum and thankfully nothing has changed apart from the exhibitions. Great staff and always happy to help you.,Fun activity for the whole family
"November 28, 2018","We went there in a rainy day to escape the rain, but we had fun inside exploring all the sections of the museum, the building itself is historic and nice to see from the inside",Interesting Venue for reception
"November 28, 2018",Attended a conference reception in this hall. It is ancient venue that is cavernous for a large reception. ,A beautiful and fascinating museum
"November 26, 2018","I visited again this week and have done so for many years returning again and again. This time I decided to become a member and I am looking forward to visiting again, especially the special exhibitions.",Never too old to learn 
"November 25, 2018",Great time spent in stunning surroundings. There’s so much to see that you’re bound to miss something. Enjoy the exhibits and marvel at the building. Go early and use the side entrance if you can. The queue was huge when we left but it was a Saturday. ,Best to Visit Earlier In The Day
"November 6, 2018",We were there at 10.00 am and already it was starting to become busy. Going a weekday there was the usual school excursion groups. It was a nice way to spend a few hours with excellent displays. The Dinosaurs were very popular so going early helped with a bit lesser crowds to get round. This is Free to enter so well worth a visit.,Very busy - but still great day out
"November 6, 2018","We visited this the week after the main half term and were amazed at just how busy it still was. There was an hour to queue before getting in. Once inside there are some fabulous exhibits - the dinosaurs were a big hit, as was the giant whale. There were also a couple of volunteers who were really engaging - our little girl was fascinated and loved being able to handle the shells and other exhibits there.",A fascinating place for many hours of visiting
"November 6, 2018","A very interesting exhibit that poses, among other things, various types of animals, including those that have long since perished - it is worth seeing a corner of dinosaurs.A great collection of minerals made also a very big impression on me.","A great place to learn about the past, present and future of our planet."
"November 4, 2018","What a great museum. If you want to learn about our planet and see things that you would not normally be able to appreciate and experience then visit the Natural History Museum. The amazing full size whale (previously a dinosaur) is amazing to see.The guides are very approachable, educated, friendly and willing to share their knowledge with you. The food can be expensive so probably best to take a packed lunch for families. Great souvenirs and A great experience for people of all ages! You could spend a whole day there.",Not been for a while
"November 4, 2018","Came here with my girlfriend as we both like museums and we loved it. The building is lovely and the exhibits were fantastic, it really is a wonder coming here and being surrounded by so much history. ",Review of 'The Wider Earth' play and cafes!
"October 31, 2018","This review is intended for people searching for reviews of 'The Wider Earth', a play about Charles Darwin that is currently on at the NHM for a few months. Don't be put off by my 4* rating - the play itself, including the script, actors, set, effects, music, setting, seating and associated staff on their own would gain a 5* rating from me – however the signage and catering at the NHM was poor and I would give a 3* for that – so averaged out to 4*!Let me review the play first. I took my 13 and 11 year olds to see this at a half term matinee, as we often go to the theatre and this sounded right up our street. We love not only the natural world and the history of those who have explored it, but also being made to think. It clearly says on the information about the play that those aged 10 or under may enjoy the puppetry and effects but may not fully grasp the concepts - so I am rather surprised that another reviewer with much younger children has complained that they didn't understand it - the advice is there in the event information! For my secondary school aged children it was perfect. It is a play that is equally well aimed at adults and older children. There are many scenes which involve quite a lot of extensive and intellectual dialogue between, for example, Darwin and his Cambridge professor, his father, the captain, and so on. This would be well beneath the heads of very young children. However, young children would indeed like the music, clever puppetry and the images portrayed, as well as the clever revolving set, but do choose wisely so as not to inconvenience either your children or other audience members!We had top price seats in Row H but to be honest, having now been there, I think the next priced down tickets would have given an equally good view, and probably even those priced lower still. Plenty of leg room in our row, with good raking and sight lines, and comfortable seats. Theatre staff were very pleasant and efficient. Note that you get a stamp put on your hand when they’ve checked your tickets – sometimes these things are useful to know if you have a child on the autistic spectrum, for example, so you can advise them in advance.However, the things that weren't so great about the visit as a whole, which are absolutely not the fault of the theatre company, and some tips, are as follows.We hadn’t been to the NHM for several years and so don’t know the layout, so it was hard to work out how to get to the Darwin Centre area, which was what we needed for the play. Their maps are terrible and confusing! If you are coming in from the entrance by that wing, which is only open for evening performances, you’ll be fine, but if coming from the usual ones in the day it is at the other end of the building. There were no signs to it until we found ourselves by chance in the main central hall bit, and we found it was down the same corridor as the dinosaurs, that leads off this. Having located where we needed to be for the play, we went to try and get some lunch.This was not straightforward either! On arrival we had already tried ‘The Kitchen’ but this had an odd layout and it was unclear if you had to queue all the way, even in front of sections you might not need, as some of it has drinks, some cold food such as sandwiches and some is serving hot food. It was unclear if you could just dip in for the bits you needed.So we left that. Then we looked in at the T Rex Grill, and found that it was table service only and there was a queue to be seated. We were worried that if service was slow we might run late for the play, though we had left plenty of time, so we left the queue there too! That was a shame as we would have liked a table service lunch.We then found ourselves at the Central Café, behind the main hall. This was packed but we found a table that was just being vacated. We struggled a bit with the choice of baguettes and wraps there, as they were quite fussy ones. I enjoyed my green falafel wrap, but my children both chose the emmental and ham baguettes and found them really tasteless, with the ham horribly stringy. They left most of them and had to rely on their crisps! There are little lunch boxes available for small children but I’m not sure what was in them. Had we not been concerned about missing the play, I would have asked for a refund for the baguettes. I then had to spend more money buying some cakes to fill them up!We would have gone to the Darwin Centre Café, right by the play, but a member of staff who we’d asked for advice on where to lunch had said it was mostly cakes, so we didn’t try it. After the play we popped in there and found that it actually would have been the nicest café of the lot as it was less busy and had a good range of sandwiches and lunch items too.I can’t comment on the rest of the Museum or exhibits as we didn’t visit these on this occasion, but beware of going at half term as in the middle of the day when we were there it was really, really, really busy in all areas that we passed through with many very young children either very excited or very stressed! I’m not sure how anyone would actually be able to get to see anything!If anyone from the Museum reads this I’d really recommend that the signage to ‘The Wider Earth’ is improved, and also that the food quality, range of offer and queueing systems are improved.However, I would thoroughly recommend ‘The Wider Earth’ but if you can I would go in the evening when it is quieter and you can enter by the entrance near the theatre, and eat somewhere else beforehand!",Fabulous museum! Kids loved it!
"October 29, 2018",Absolutely amazing museum! It is huge with lots and lots to see. We didn’t manage to see it all as it was a little too much for our youngest to walk. But we’ll come back next time. The whale is an absolute classic and amazing to see. The T-Rex was the highlight for our kids. We had a blast! ,Packed but informative 
"October 24, 2018",Brilliant for something free in London. Full of educational opportunities and set in a magnificent building not far from most other things in the capital. Well worth a look if you are in London.,Free admission. Amazing
"October 23, 2018","Free admission. There will be staff standing along the entrance asking for donations. Choose wisely whether to donate or not. After all, it is free admission. Toilets and cafes available. Beautiful architectural. Easy to get to the museum by bus or underground train. ",A surprising theatre treat - The Wider Earth
"October 23, 2018",Went to this Museum on a recent visit and was thrilled to see that there was a theatre now built in the Jerwood Gallery with a show about Charles Darwin (looking very different to the statue in the museum) and his voyage on the Beagle. Done by an Australian puppet company it has the most gorgeous visual effects and amazing puppets. Great insight into how Darwin developed his theory of evolution. Sheer delight!,Exciting at any age
"November 24, 2018","My husband and I were at the Natural History Museum for the first time and it's a very interesting and exciting place! You don't need to be a child or to come here with children to truly enjoy the visit.We went straight to the Dinosaurs exhibit which is amazingly made, very informative and interesting. There is also a great dinosaur themed gift shop near the exhibit. All other exhibits, like mammals, minerals etc., are also very interesting. The building itself is a piece of art and worth reading about at the top floor.The entrance is free and you can easily spend here few hours, it's a perfect activity for a rainy day.",Natural History Museum
"November 20, 2018","The Natural History was cool, but I wouldn't rank it at the top compared to the other things to do in London, or even just compared against some of the other museums around London.The building itself is beautiful, but it is massive.  You could easily spend an entire day here and just scratch the surface of the depth and breadth of the collection.  Be sure to have a plan before you arrive because the museum doesn't give away maps and the museum itself is confusingly arranged into zones.We did some research before we went and purchased a guide book that included a map of the building so that we wouldn't have to buy one there.  We allocated 3 hours to tour the museum and that was plenty of time for us to see what we wanted to see with a break at the café to have lunch.  We were also there on Remembrance Day, so the museum was packed with people.We arrived right as the museum was opening, so we didn't have to queue long to get in.  The Dinosaurs, Minerals, and the Treasures Room were our top favorites.They have a few restaurants to choose from.  We ate at the cafe and it was really good!  They also have a fancier table service restaurant and a cafeteria style food court.  There are a few gift shops as well if you want to pick out some souvenirs.  We arranged our day to have a walk through Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens before walking over to the museum which opens at 10.  I thought that was a good use of time.",A London Landmark
"November 19, 2018","I have been to NHM many times, as a child on school trips and now taking my own children to go and see the dinosaurs. My children absolutely love the museum and all the interesting exhibitions. We tend to get there early before it opens but even then there is always a queue, but once you are in the crowds disperse and it's actually quite a nice morning out. We have eaten at the restaurant on site too as this was reasonably priced for London with a good selection of food. But the best visit was for a wedding reception in the main hall. It was beautiful! If I could go back and marry my husband again, I would most definitely have our reception here as it is so different and magical. ",Informative half day activity for the family
"November 19, 2018",This museum is free to enter and great for something to do with the slightly older children as there is quite a bit to get around!,Great museum
"November 17, 2018","Thoroughly enjoyed most of the museum. A great place to walk around and spend time. Also, free but donations are definitely welcomed.",Best museum in London
"November 17, 2018","We visited the museum mainly to see the whale but then the more we started to explore it was super interesting. They had different categories from fossils, gems, science, sea creatures, birds and more. We need a good half day in order to go through all. I suggest a full day for a nice and relaxing time specially if you go with kids. Definitely worth the visit I recommend!",Dino Snores
"November 14, 2018","Amazing - what an incredible experience for the kids and adults.  We intentionally didn't visit the museum before so it was all new and exciting.  Arrived to make up our camp then run around exploring (burning off some energy)!  Met new friends, designed a t-shirt, did a torch light trail in the dinosaur hall, had snack and then watched a science show.  Mid-night lights out and 7am breakfast then an Animal Man Show.  We spent all day Sunday in the museum and could have stayed longer.  Few things I wish I'd known but they didn't spoil the experience at all - there is a snack vending machine in the dining hall so don't panic looking for a shop if you haven't remembered to pack snack, the hall got very cold at night so bring a jumper to sleep in, if you didn't book on the same booking with friends you will be put in different groups even if you chose the same group name, breakfast is a fruit muffin and yoghurt which very few kids ate so bring something they will eat and very importantly tea and coffee is available for the adults at snack time and at breakfast!  Suggestions for the planners - the science show was last so around 10pm and a lot of the kids fell asleep in the chairs so didn't see it or participate.  Might be an idea to switch the order of activities somehow.  Also, the rubbings in the dinotrail didn't work and the strings were too short for the kids to hold.  Stamping might work better.",How can you not like this place?
"November 8, 2018",I don't think that I've ever been disappointed with a visit to this museum. There is always something new and interesting to be discovered. ,Interesting place
"November 7, 2018","Very interesting place if you like history, loads to look at , it’s got a restaurant but we didn’t eat here",Interesting prehistoric fossils in beautiful architecture
"November 7, 2018","Housed in one of the most architecturally beautiful buildings in the city, one could very well go just to admire the large halls and towering facades. In the main hall you now have the skeleton of a prehistoric blue whale, replacing its dinosaur predecessor. They have fun events every now and then, like showcasing horror movies this past Halloween, so do check their page. Otherwise, they have nice displays of all kinds of prehistoric creatures ranging from creepy crawlies to mammoths. Great for family days out and will keep children engaged.  ",Excellent and Family Friendly Museum
"October 23, 2018","Great museum that has something for everyone - stuff to touch and a playroom for children/toddlers, gorgeous gems, and a moving dinosaur.  Plus, an outdoor area that is refreshing in the concrete jungle of London.",Amazing
"October 22, 2018","Great place to visit with the kids, been twice now and loved it both times. Incredible building with lots to see and do. Brilliant.",Grand place
"October 19, 2018",Although very busy we loved our time there. The cafe was reasonable with friendly staff. The exhibitions are truly historically impressive and important. Both my younger son and teenager found the place mesmerising. The entrance is free but donations are requested which we liked. ,School Groups
"October 19, 2018",The Natural History Museum was the last place I visited in London prior to leaving for Heathrow. It was a Friday so I didn’t think that they would be that busy but I forgot about the school groups. They were everyone and had no supervision. Also the museum was lacking staff to ask questions throughout the museum but had about ten people working the shop. I was limited on time so I visited two areas: the treasures and the dinosaurs. The treasure were very interesting and some of the most important  items in the museum. The dinosaurs was more geared towards children but they had some nice skeletons. Worth some time but the crowds are huge. Plus it is free. ,Spectacular - many wonderful displays
"October 18, 2018","Both inside and outside, this is a spectacular building.  It is vast, and very popular.  So you might want to make some plans ahead of time.While it is free to get in there are some displays that have a charge,",Good museum
"October 14, 2018","Large museum; with great exhibitions, however very crowded, and the lunch menu was average. Probably better on weekdays than rainy weekend.",Go and see the big whale fossil
"October 10, 2018",The whale fossil hanging from the ceiling of the hall is huge.  experience the earthquake in Kobe supermarket - it was fun.  Free admission - excellent place for primary school kids.,Great day
"October 8, 2018","Fantastic museum with endless models, exhibits and displays of notable natural history discoveries and knowledge.Loads of stuff to see and do, especially for kids. The cavernous mineral hall is exceptional, as is the section of trunk from the giant Sequoia tree.Plan to spend several hours looking round.",Kids love it
"October 8, 2018","The Natural History Museum is a must on a visit to London and kids of all ages love it, though mostly for the dinosaurs and whales. It is easily accessible, has multiple cafes that are family friendly and reasonably priced. A great place to visit if it is raining and you are up for a wander. Entry is free although a donation is requested.",So much fjn
"October 8, 2018",For a first time visiter (in my 20s) I can honestly say that I enjoyed myself tremendously. We were there for roughly two and a half hours and looked through maybe half of the exhibits. There was a wide range that everyone enjoyed. ,Perfect Family Free Option for London
"September 21, 2018","I was on my own and decided to do the museum. It was fascinating, free (but It’s good to make a donation). They have an extensive dinosaur exhibit and body exhibit. I didn’t get to rest but it looked great.  I would recommend for families. ",Really interesting
"September 21, 2018","This museum is  HUGE and if you want to see it all, you have to dedicate a whole day. We spent about 4 hrs and we did not see all of the museum. I really liked to volcanoes and earthquakes section since it was so interactive. ",A must see in London - combine with the Science museum (around the corner) for a great day out
"September 20, 2018","I grew up in the UK and drove past the Natural History Museum every day on my way to and from work... it wasn't until I moved to Asia and had kids that I came to appreciate it.I took my 7, 9 and 10-year-old kids back to London over the summer and did all the sights... without question, the Natual History Museum was by far the best, the staff were great, the displays engaging and my kids loved it. In that area, you also have London zoo (don't bother), the Science Museum (very good) and the V&A (also good).",Stunning 
"September 19, 2018","What an amazingly beautiful building. The exhibitions are tippy top quality. You should plan to stay for a few hours minimum, or a second day if you want to take it all in. There is a Restaurant/Cafe.",Brilliant musuem so much to see
"September 17, 2018","we had a really lovely day out here, highly recommend comfy shoes as theres lots of walking. Felt the dinosaur exhibit was a bit of a let down as compared to the New York Natural History museum they are displayed better so you can get better pictures and you can view from a high vantage pint whereas in London everything was on ground level and a lot of the time the volume of people made it difficult to see everything. Found the volcano and earthquakes exhibit really interesting especially where you can go on an earthquake simulator. The animal exhibit again is amazing with lots to see and learn. And particularly liked the precious gem section as well. There's a nice cafe where we stopped for cake with plenty of assortment plus the gift shop had lots of things to buy as souvenirs although not much choice of postcards.",Superb Day out . 
"September 12, 2018",Last came many years ago with my children .enjoyed it very much just as I remembered it .Be aware that the t rex is being maintained atm & is unavailable till end of September. The earthquake / volcano exhibition was our fave Please remember to leave a donation. ,Where do I start
"September 12, 2018",Living in the DC area we have a great natural history museum.  This one comes close to the local museum (maybe I am being a bit prejudice)  Great visit especially if you are traveling with children.,Beautiful Architecture 
"September 11, 2018","Another beautiful view of London we adore.most happiest place for kids,needed a month to explore this place.25 metre long skeleton of blue whale 🐋 is amazing.romanesque style architecture is mind blowing.worth visiting for the amazing permanent collection.",Awesome.
"September 11, 2018",The museum is incredible. We really liked the Dinosaur and the Mammal sections but the Human Body section was also really good. It's better to go there early since it gets really busy around noon and there are large amounts of people in the more popular exhibits such as the animatronic T-Rex.,It's worth a visit
"September 9, 2018","We were highly recommended by our friends to visit this Museum when we were in the UK for a short trip. So we did and the big blue whale skeleton had caught our attention when we entered into the building. There's a lot to see and in fact a lot to learn. After the visited, we realized how little that we know about the nature creation. Highly recommend for everyone during your stay in London.",Rich exhibition 
"May 26, 2018",My 14 year old boy ran from room to room and was amazed of the varied exhibitions and beautiful building. ,"Come for the natural history, stay for the building."
"May 26, 2018",This place is such a treasure trove of information and cool little finds. It's amazing to walk around in such a stunning building and look at all the animals. But it's easy to find yourself imagining all those adventurers that went out around the world collecting all the strange and wonderful things for the crown & science. ,Butterflies
"May 26, 2018",Absolutely loved the butterfly garden. My husband gave me a hard time at first for buying tickets to the exhibit but it was one of the coolest things we have ever done!,The building is gorgeous! The exhibits amazing!
"May 26, 2018","What's a gorgeous place !  You can spend a long time just walking around the building looking at the details of this gorgeous place.The exhibits are a amazing. Love the one of the dinasours and the one of the minerals.You need few hours to be able to see the whole museum. We were there 2 hours and did not see it all!The courtyard of this museum is so gorgeous ! The lighting perfect.The museum store, love it! Great things to buy!",Interesting Place for Children
"May 26, 2018","My wife, two-and-a-half year old son and I visited the Natural History Museum on a Thursday afternoon. It was busy but not over-crowded. My son loved the numerous exhibits/skeletons, some pre-historic, including those of fish, birds and mammals. I guess, when he visits in future, he would be able to benefit from the written information and interactive displays pertaining to the exhibits.   If anything, dinosaurs appear to be over-valued and over-presented, even in the museum shop. Otherwise, the shop has plenty to offer for children ranging from stuffed toys to sophisticated scientific models. The paid “Butterfly exhibition” in the outside lawn was not worth the heavy cost. The visit was not fabulous but evokes pleasant memories.",Fun place for children
"May 25, 2018",This is the best museum for the children to enjoy. A pleasant connection to the many areas of its collection are most enjoyable and an attractive way to spend time on a rainy day or educational pursuits. ,"Been a while,but still absorbing"
"May 24, 2018","Long time since been to this venueLoads of up-dated exhibits and activities Our fault,there were lots of school groups,although these did only cause minor irritations Great venue to spend a significant quantity of time in,regardless of the weather",Wonderful and exciting!
"May 23, 2018","I’ve been here so many times as a child and it really does get better with age. The artefacts are so varied and old, from parts of the planet mars to precious gems to some of the worlds most complete skeleton structures discovered of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals. You have to visit here for sure! There’s bones that are like 40000 years old!The only downside is the way they make you enter and “force” you to donate. I felt very pressurised to give a suggested donation of £5. I understand that they need funding but why have a free museum but you can’t enter until you donate? (There are ropes and desks set up you can’t get past and the staff are very happy to suggest the entry fee). You can just walk past but there’s a security guard and an kiosk merchant stood right in the way.",Lots to see
"May 22, 2018",There is much to see. Went there with friends and wr had a great time. You can walk through how life began all the way through now. ,Really crowded
"May 21, 2018",It was very hot and crowded so plan when you go accordingly. We had a hard time seeing much of the exhibits but the dinosaur one is really great.,Great visit
"June 18, 2018",Great visit. Was very impressed in the different galleries. Was very interesting. Probably  best time to go is mid week. We went on a Sunday . Got very crowded.,Stuff of childhood dreams
"June 17, 2018",What a fantastic building- great exhibits and helpful staff. We highly recommend the adventure to the deep talk - download the app for nhm and remember your headphones . Excellent.,Educational 
"June 17, 2018",This place is quite educational in nature and it would take almost a full day to go through various sections.We loved the section on mineral and earths core. The children would enjoy the section on animals. ,National Treasure 
"June 16, 2018","Recommend arriving early, we were there at 10.15am on a Friday and crowds were few, by time we left at 1pm the museum was very busy. Highlight was the Wildlife photographer of the Year exhibition. We paid £15 each and was worth every penny with each photo telling a story. My husband and I have been a few times throughout the years but this magical museum never fails to impress from the smallest of animals such as the creepy crawly exhibition to the main entrance hall to see the blue whale. ",Best museum I’ve seen
"June 15, 2018","I thoroughly enjoyed myself in the NHM. It is very entertaining and it teaches a lot of different things on animals. I enjoyed the part « human biology » that was very interesting and entertaining at the same time. For me, it was the best museum of those I have visited, and it is absolutely fantastic for children and teens! (And also for adults of course). You have to go there ;) ",Must visit
"June 14, 2018",Its a wonderful experience for free. The exhibits are good and easy to follow.Should keep about minimum 4 hours aside to see it.,Excellent collection of dinosaur fossils! Great for kids!
"June 12, 2018",We spent about 2 hours here and did not get to see everything. 3-4 hours would be a good time frame. Very similar to other Natural History museums we have visited. The treasure room was amazing and was the highlight for us. I would say this is best for children age 5 and up. ,Museum 
"June 12, 2018","Great place for everyone to enjoy. Great exhibits. Loved the dinosaur exhibition, and so did all the Kids around as well! I thoroughly recommend a visit. ",To visit
"June 9, 2018","The location is amazing and what's inside even more. Good also the interactive wings to entertain our daughter. At no cost, free offer, what to expect more.",Must-Go when travelling with kids
"June 1, 2018","Houses an amazing collection of skeletons, animal specimens, information on dinosaur and other animals. My daughter simply loved it...especially the human biology segment. Every exhibit is explained and sometime in very interactive way. It is in South Kensington and entry is free. ",Simply astounding 
"July 15, 2018","I have visited the museum of natural history around 7 times and I make it a must to visit it again every time I'm in London to catch up on recent discoveries and displays. My all time favourite section is the dinosaurs and this museum is constantly up to date with its newsletters, website, etc. It caters for families with young children as well as the disabled and most displays and guides have different languages to avoid there being a language barrier. I have not had not one problem during my visits. Of course seasons effect how busy and packed it gets but it is still definitely worth the visit. ",Fun family day
"July 15, 2018","We were on vacation and knew we wanted to visit NHM because of the dinosaurs and butterfly exhibit.It was a hit! Our 3 year old twin girls loved the butterflies and Dinosaurs! The T-Rex was incredible, haven’t seen anything like that before.Other areas that were a hit with the kids was the escalator that goes up into what looks like earth and the earthquake shake.I think NHM will have something for everyone. We didn’t see everything just the areas of interest for our family.The building is beautiful. It’s definitely worth a visit for all ages and it’s free :)))))",Nice museum
"July 15, 2018","Lots of dinosaur, animal exhibits. Moving dinosaur models are pretty cool. Exhibits on humans, memory, vision etc are pretty cool as well. Beautiful exterior.close to Science museum and V&A museum.Free entry but can donate to museum if you wish",Lots of fun 
"July 14, 2018",Great fun and wide variety of exhibits to suit all ages and interests. One of the many museums which offer a free entry. Great gift shop available. ,Dinosnores
"July 13, 2018","What appeared to be a fun ‘big kid’ experience turned out to be a rushed, school trip throw back of an evening. The museum is fantastic and the building itself is striking, however the management of the dinosnores event was poor. The food is expensive and poor in quality which was a shame and the itinerary is a bit lacking in the execution. Pop up stalls that focus on ticking the box rather than offering something of value. The real challenge is security, literally. It’s obvious that they don’t like the event and it’s an inconvenience to have people around after hours, I over heard a number of conversations as I moved around where security guards were complaining and saying the guests were ‘taking the piss’ and they were generally rude. I’m not usually thin skinned so it wouldn’t have bothered me but the movie marathon they run all night if you can’t sleep was pointless as security goaded you back from anywhere other than the main hall where guests are expected to sleep, again a real shame. Could have been great but I wouldn’t recommend this in view of what’s on offer elsewhere in London.",Very informative
"July 13, 2018","Free entrance,you can contribute if you like for maintenance .Beautiful building, very informative for all age group",Excellent free museum to view with kids
"July 12, 2018",We had to see this museum after watching Paddington Bear. It is just as cool as the movie showed with room after grand room of amazing stuffed animals. The architecture is amazing and best of all it is free. What is not to love? ,Beautiful Museum 
"July 12, 2018","It has been years since I was a kid and visited here with school.What a beautiful, well kept museum. Full of amazing artefacts, dinosaurs, birds etc.No doubt we will be back when the boy is slightly older.Considering how busy it was it wasn’t chaotic.Very pleasant stroll around.",“A cathedral to nature”
"July 12, 2018","The building itself is so extraordinarily beautiful that it is worth a visit even if you have no interest in animals or plants. I was last here at least 10 years ago and was interested to see what had changed. I have to admit that Dippy the Diplodocus made a more dramatic impact in the entrance hall than the whale that has replaced him. The exhibits in the alcoves around it were all new and interesting. My daughter and I visited the marine biology section where I noticed some exhibits had been “temporarily removed” in 2014! It seems a shame to leave gaps for that long when the museum has so many exhibits in storage that are never displayed. The mammals section, to be honest, needed a good dusting and was quite dated looking. I hope visitors are paying the £5 requested donation (as we did) and that the slight air of neglect I observed is not for lack of funds. ",Just Amazing!
"July 11, 2018","Visited with 2 children age 9 & 7- travelled from Ireland for a few days to London.....This was by far the highlight of our trip. First day we went, was on a Tuesday in the first week in June @ 1pm - no queues. Second day we went was the next Saturday (yes we went twice because we loved it so much) @ 10am - big queues but seemingly queues get even bigger during school summer holidays. Building itself is beautiful & worth seeing inside. Range of skeletal animals, bug species and nature artefacts are huge. The Dinosaur section is class-don’t miss that.   Plant section is v interesting and laid out so well- children were never board. Talks for children take place in different areas at different times- we didn’t attend any due to time constraints but sound v good. Don’t miss the blue whale! Give yourself a full day to go and explore - it takes a while to see everything. Lots of toilets on-site and a lovely restaurant . Go early in morn and mid-week to avoid queues. I will be visiting again soon - such a nice day out! ",One of the best museums in the world
"July 10, 2018",You could spend days in here and a visit is absolutely essential if you are in London. The building is beautiful and the collection and general level of information on exhibits is second to none.,Great Museum
"July 9, 2018","Really nice museum, loved the dinosaurs!  Free entry, donations optional.  Easy to get around and well worth a visit",Great exhibits - very interesting
"July 9, 2018","My husband and I spent a few hours here and really enjoyed all of the dinosaur and wildlife exhibits.  There is also a large, fantastic gift shop full of nature-themed gifts.  A great place to spend an afternoon.",Beautiful 
"July 8, 2018",Stunning collection such a wide variety from animals to dinosaurs and world cultures all stored inside a beautiful building easy to get to and mist deffinatly worth a visit ,Day visit 
"July 8, 2018",Had a wonderful day however this museum is packed and way way to hot needs better air con. Exhibits are all excellent and staff are very friendly and approachable!!,LOVED IT! 
"July 5, 2018",I could've spent the whole day exploring this gorgeous and fascinating museum but only had a couple of hours.  Exceptional with lots of interesting exhibits.  A must see!,Military 
"July 2, 2018",Really enjoyed this trip to the museum learned a lot about the origins of the species would definitely visit again in order to learn more it’s a real jewel in the crown as far as places of interest are concerned ,Worth the visit
"June 30, 2018","If you are considering wether to visit it or not, if you are an art lover I think you MUST visit it because the have some of the most important art pieces in the world It’s for free just take the guide with money and enjoy the information of the art There is one section the art for money but was worth it although I wasn’t allowed to take pictures but I did haha",Great for the kids. Don't miss the Dinosaur exhibit
"June 29, 2018",This was our first stop on our London 4-day family tour. We went here to kill the yet lag as were staying a at hotel nearby. The building is impressive. We suggest to visit the early humans and dinosaurs exhibits. ,The minerals and gems area is worth the visit 
"June 28, 2018",My daughter and I really enjoyed this museum even more than the British museum. Really interesting exhibits and the minerals and gems section was awesome. We could have stayed there longer. Great for kids and adults. ,Nice place
"May 21, 2018",Natural history museums aren't my favorite type of museums by this one was very nice. Its size isnt as overwhelming as some of the museums in the area. Lots of kids. Bring patience,"Gorgeous building, so-so exhibits"
"May 11, 2018","We planned a mid-week visit, but were unaware that the day was a bank holiday, so it was really crowded. If you go, you must be very tolerant of parents of young children. The dinosaur exhibit appears to have undergone a fairly recent re-do, but traffic control is not ideal in the area, and most of the information placards still refer to dinosaurs as reptiles. It is also a challenge to match up the exhibit with its identifying information.Most surprising and disappointing was the condition of a great deal of the mammal exhibits. These are housed in an area where there is a great deal of natural light. The specimens are very, very faded and look quite shabby. An explanatory plaque states that the museum does not want to replace the specimens, because of the endangered status of many of the animals. While commendable, it would make for a better exhibit if they attempted some sort of restoration with the specimens they have on display. The coloration on the giant panda and the cheetah are barely discernible. The building itself is gorgeous, and worth a look around even if you decide to skip the exhibits, but if you are accustomed to the natural history museums in New York, Washington DC, and Chicago, this one might be a bit of a letdown.",Go early and avoid weekends!
"May 11, 2018",One of the best museums that I have been to in a long time. The photography exhibit is a small charge but the entry to the museum is free. The butterfly exhibit is going on until summer of 2018 too.,Best collection of bones in the world!
"May 9, 2018","I'm pretty sure that my dog has dreams that are very similar to the contents of this museum :DIt is absolutely amazing to see all these species, all so different in one place. it's kind of humbling really. Brilliant place for Kids and Grown ups!",A Huge Museum With Items Collected From All Over The World
"May 8, 2018",This museum is much larger then the ones that I have seen in the US. They have huge sections each with it's own exhibits. My favorite exhibit was the mineral exhibit. The room was larger then some museums. I also paid extra to visit the Wildlife Photography exhibit. It was outstanding. If you like photography then you will love this exhibit. Overall this museum has a lot to see and it will take you the better part of a day to see it all. This place is worth a visit. Young and old will be amazed.,"Way too busy, and the dust!"
"May 8, 2018","Sure, it is sort of blasphemous to give the NHM such a low rating. It is such a marvelous building, awe inspiring. But let’s be fair: many of the displays are outdated, the interactive ones didn’t work half the time. You walk around cramped corridors. And look at the amount of dust on the displays! Especially the blue zone (have a look from above at the whale)...!there is a interesting simulated disaster zone at the Earth gallery, but with so many people cramped in the restaurant at ground floor level, and all the litter lying around just there, they created a non-simulated disaster zone right there.",Margboyle
"May 3, 2018",I was there last wk it was a fantastic place to visit so much to see and would recommend this to everyone ,Beautiful but crowded
"May 1, 2018","I made the mistake of going a rainy Saturday and it was quite packed! The museum itself is beautiful, I really liked the idea of touching most things and interactive features! But make sure you go on a weekday if you don’t like kids running everywhere",So much to see!
"April 30, 2018",We saw a few exhibits but just a few.  We didn’t allow enough time.  The volcano exhibit was most informative!,You will see pictures here you didn’t know you knew!
"April 29, 2018",Fantastic gallery to see some of the world most famous art within touching distance and for free. From the life size horse painting by Stubbs to Turners Haywain and Monets water lilies,Day trip
"March 17, 2018",Well worth a visit really enjoyed this museum. This museum is ideal to visit with kids a lot of exhibits which they qould like,Amazing
"March 13, 2018","fantastic, could spend hours here and we did! caters for all ages, very busy saturday afternoon. no admission fee, close to south kensington tube",Love it!!!
"March 6, 2018","My second visit to the museum and for the second time I was more than happy with it! The exhibitions are stunning. I went there to see the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition and unfortunately the tickets were sold out, so we had to buy a family membership. After all it summed up to be a good decision and for sure we gonna come back again... this time with kids!",London weekend
"March 5, 2018",When we first arrived we went to main entrance big queues but were advised by staff to go side entrance for lesser queues he was right hardly had to wait inside you are searched we were on last day of holiday so had suitcases with us big mistake they weigh your bags and our bags worked out a fiver each at the cloakroom we weren’t allowed to take through even though bags checked .Museum itself is huge lots of displays could easy spend half day full day hear number of exhibitions going in also although they were full Very  pretty minerals in the vault and a massive one on the top floor .Lots of information around and there is a floor for schools and restaurants if your hungry.Shop with souvenirs for sale .Inside if the buildings reminds me of Harry Potter.Toilets and lifts available.,Great way to spend some time
"March 4, 2018",This is an iconic venue with extremely impressive exhibits. It's also free although a £5 donation is requested. Would be a bit churlish not to help.Fantastic place... highly recommended ,Never on a Saturday!
"March 4, 2018",Standing in a mile long line on a rainy Saturday morning finally led to admittance to this wonder of a museum.  Thousands of people packed the exhibit halls.  Many children used their time chasing and yelling.  Choose a time to visit this grand old dame on a week-day.,Great collection
"March 2, 2018","but awfully crowded. Maybe one should visited shortly before closing and decide on just one exhebition. Especially the dinosaurs are very popular. At the moment they're changing or refurbishing some parts. The main entrance is closed.The Tube Station 'South Kensington' is nearby and around the corner you can find the V & A, as well. ",THE BEST MUSEUM IN LONDON!!
"February 27, 2018","We come here every time we go to London. The building is gorgeous, it is free, and it has such an incredible collection! Some items are getting a little faded as there are some very old pieces but there are plenty of modern displays and we like that the museum combines old and new. Don't miss the very popular dinosaur exhibit with an animated T rex (which can be a bit too scary for very young kids). Easy to reach via the 74 bus or South Kensington tube. Super gift shop!",Some great exhibts for kids but a few tired ones too
"February 23, 2018",Visited with 2 young kids.  The place is fantastically vast and worth it for the architecture alone.  There are some great exhibits dinosaurs and the mamals with good combination of exhibits and details.The age/funding of the museum is also showing in other areas such as the marine section which looked very tired.,Flying
"February 23, 2018",Just a flying visit to take a look at the blue whale skeleton that has replaced the dinosaur skeletonExcellent as usual ,"Educational, busy and ever so slightly dull"
"April 5, 2018","We queued for half an hour to enter but it was Easter weekend so I guess it's to be expected. Our first stop was the dinosaurs. The exhibition was too busy to enjoy. We were ushered like cattle and told to keep moving - no time to see anything in detail. If you are planning a visit make sure you see this part very early or very late when it will be quieter. The rest of the place, whilst worthy and packed full of information was just a bit dull. Case after case of stuffed animals became a little repetitive. There was a lack of interactive exhibitions to break the stuffed animals up. Worth seeing as the building is amazing but not worth a repeat visit.",Snap shot of history
"April 3, 2018",Close to Harrod's this museum is an interesting perspective on what used to be the British Empire. The various sections of the museum house different time periods as well as different themes. We did not get enough time in this wonderful building but it would probably take more than a day to do it justice. The building is magnificent and the staff helpful. There is a great gift shop  inside so take your time and enjoy it.,Best in the World
"April 3, 2018","Much more better than ones in New York and Washington, DC. A lot of interesting stuff and crowds of people",Must visit!!!!
"April 3, 2018","when in london with family, nhm definitely is one of the things to do.one should try and find atleast 3 hours on any day , slightly more on weekends i suggest.even as adults we enjoyed the place a lot, dinosaur at the entrance is awesome view.Kids above 5 would love it i bet and then stuff upstairs like how volcano erupts/ earth plating/ earthquake room all is nice learning experience and guess what is free of charge !!!don’t miss it ",Brilliant visit
"April 2, 2018",The natural history museum never disappoints. It’s free to visit with the option of giving a contribution. We visited after lunch during the Easter holidays and we were only queuing for around 10 minutes. It has loads to see and do and our daughters aged 7 and 3 absolutely loved it. It clean and well laid out. We particularly enjoyed the dinosaur section.  ,A great day out with family and friends
"April 1, 2018", Visited NHM on 1st April and i was absolutely pleased from start to end. Once we got to the museum we had to wait in a queue which was long but was moving at a steady pace. Took us around 20mins to get in but was definitely worth the wait. Staff were great and attentive. Knew all the answers to questions we were throwing at them and did there absolute best to help us. The museum itself is an awesome experience for any one who is any age. Tonnes of knowledge to indulge in and a lot to see.We spent 2 hours here and still didnt finish some parts of the museum. Definitely will return to complete the tour.,Long visit
"March 31, 2018",We was here at easter weekend And there was a lot of other people. Exhibition was good but just good ... free entrance.,"Popular, free entry"
"March 28, 2018","Visited on a weekend where there is a controlled queue entering into the museum due to large crowds. However, it was well controlled and moved relatively fast. Free entry to the permanent exhibits but all visitors are encouraged to donate. Great and engaging displays. Will recommend to all types of travellers including families. ",Remembering childhood
"March 28, 2018","Although a bit dusty, it's always good to remember one of the icons of my childhood.And it remains one of the greatest natural history museums of the world",Amazing museum !
"March 27, 2018",A must go to in London ! Despite the crowd we were able to see at our pace what we liked most ! An app is available to plan your visit before if needed !,Night at the museum personified!!!
"January 13, 2018",This museum is really quite impressive with its various exhibits. Was surprised that they did not capitalize on the movie since it was shot here. It's an amazing  place to spend several hours or even a day with all of the interactive exhibits. And it's FREE!!!,Interactive and informative
"January 12, 2018",It will be good to go early in the morning and dedicate the entire day to visit the museum. A good place to learn!,Excellent 
"January 11, 2018",This museum is perfect ! I love it and also it is a incredible idea to go there with children the place is a dream ! Lovely ! ,Incredible number of things yo see
"January 9, 2018",This museum is really interactive and fun. We visited the Dinosaur area and were really impressed wth the automation and path through this area with lots of explanations and a few surprises!  Each if my family was able to find something of interest and this was just a small part of the museum. The architecture of the building itself is also stunning. I will definitely go back!,Fab museum 
"January 7, 2018","We visited the Natural history museum today it was our second trip. As usual the dinosaur and fossil exhibits were my sons favourite. However we discovered a fab area in the basement of the green zone beneath the main shop which was a discovery area. This areas allowed everyone to hold, examine and research bones, and fossils all with fab microscopes, reference books and research kits. My son who is 10 loved it as did all the children. Great staff on hand also to explain how to use the equipment. Next door is a really good picnic area where you can buy our eat your own food ( a lot cheaper than using the cafes!).Also we always find it is best to use the Cromwell room entrance to Avoid the main Queue's. ",Fun day out
"January 6, 2018",Fun day out for all of the family. So much to see & do. Exhibitions change but always worth the trip. You will probably have to queue to get in but the queue moves quickly. Great for all ages,Favourite museum in London 
"January 5, 2018","One of the best museums in London, loved the entrance hall and the Dino section is incredible, also the animals part we enjoyed been there many many times . Can get really busy over the weekends and kids holidays. ",Another great historic place to visit... and another one that's free!
"December 28, 2017",This place is either a short bus or tube ride if you are centrally located.  You can easily spend a day here looking at all the exhibits.  If you like history... you will love this place and it is well worth a visit,Huge museum
"December 28, 2017","A must visit place in London. The entrance is free and they have many categories in separate halls. Outside the museum, there is a ski area in winter which is very nice. You need to pay for the ski.",Amazing... one of the best museums I have ever been! And free!!!
"December 26, 2017","Simply A M A Z I N G! One of the best museums I have ever been and for sure one of the best museums in the world. Please, go!!! Don't hesitate also to make a donation, the place is free and you can totally go without paying but once you're there and see how amazing it is your heart will tell you to do right and make a donation, if you can't that's no matter, you still can go freely and enjoy everything but the important thing is YOU MUST GO!",Fascinating day out
"December 22, 2017","My husband and I visited this Museum in December, we could have spent most of the day here. So much to see among the fascinating displays. We found the dinosaur displays to be particularly well done, especially the Tyrannosaurus Rex life size model which moves and 'appears' to come to life! This Museum is perfect for any age young or old.",Venom exhibition
"December 22, 2017","Wonderful place! We go there frequently because in addition to their permanent exhibits they always introduce new temporary exhibitions. Yesterday we visited the Venom exhibition. As usual fun, informative and successful in engaging all age groups. A must see if you are in London. The actual building is also great to see every time!",NHM Visit
"December 21, 2017","This is our 2nd time visiting NHM whenever we are in London. NHM never fail to impress us. Good job NHM. will visit again. NHM is just opposite V&A, another amazing museum. ",Awesome!
"December 20, 2017","It's so cool to see all the animals, the history behind them, the building itself is fantastic, I loved every single minute spent there.",Worth going
"December 20, 2017","For a free entry, it is no doubt worth a look, with a wide range of exhibits and some stunning architecture. Perhaps not enough for an entire day, but easily a couple of solid hours of entertainment",So much to see and learn..
"December 14, 2017","Our museums are so busy that their enjoyment can be impaired. I also think that there should be an entrance fee. What is ""free"" is not appreciated. There are few donations..such a shame. It also looks like ""begging"". ",Areas of interest for everyone
"December 11, 2017","No matter what your age, from a 2 year old toddler to 90 years, everybody will find something that sparks their interest. There are so many radiating exhibits. Wonderful.",Boring!
"December 8, 2017","I was excited to go here since it was free and I would be able to see fossils and real skeletons of dinosaurs, however I was left disappointed. I do not think that that they have real skeletons of dinosaurs. There was too much fakeness in the museum as they just had artificial models of animals. That, for me, was what made the visit a big let down since nothing was authentic as you would expect in an actual museum. Not all of the museum is free as there are some areas where you have to buy a ticket in order to get in. Also, I felt that the museum is more ideal for families, young kids and teenage students. I will never return back here again. I think a zoo is better off!",So much to see
"December 8, 2017","Even if you don't care about aby of the exhibitions the building along is worth seeing. As the museum is free (although you're encouraged to make a donation, which you really should as this is a great place). Even if some of the regular exhibitions are a little old the museum manages to capture your imagination and gets you interested. There are a number of things you can do, try, test that will entertain and teach regardless of whether you're an adult or a kid. Because the place is so big is doesn't feel crowded. There are so many difference shows and areas of natural history that you are bound to find some to your liking ... and most likely you'll discover that you have too little time on your hands. Also I dare you to count the number of 'wow' you hear from amazed kids.",Great Exhibits
"December 7, 2017","Going to the museum is easy, just get off the tube at South Kensington Stn. The entrance is free except for a few exhibits. There's plenty of exhibits and you really need to plan, else you can get lost going round and round.. its like a maze in there.The dinosaur and ancient animal fossils were Great! There's sections for children as well. Allocate enough time there..4 hours not enough to see all. Will come back again",A Visit to the Natural World Before IMAX...and then hitting the Ice Rink!
"February 4, 2018","We popped in during Christmas holidays on a weekday and had mixed emotions like the rest of the attendees choosing to review the Grand Dame. The bottom line is we needed to burn two hours before our IMAX movie and it did the trick.For starters, it’s free and the architecture alone is stunning. The staff is helpful and there seems to be something for everyone in terms of collections: spiders, volcanoes, rocks, dinosaurs, the infamous blue whale model, and more! Our favorite (boys ages 12 and 15) is the world-class display of animals and birds. The sheer volume is unbelievable and priceless.However, no exhibit will be left undiscovered unless you intend to spend hours and hours at the Natural History Museum, if not days.Remember, we had 120 minutes! This meant we skipped the two temporary exhibits, the Ocean and the Wildlife Photographer of the Year, which was each offered for a fee, and roamed freely until it was time for our show.My takeaway…this is an old-school museum. Does it need to be updated? Yeah, but then it changes the dynamics. I’m not embarrassed to say I loved showing my boys items I grew up using such as telescopes, typewriters, and telephones. Plus let’s face it, the approach in terms of style and display IS part of the attraction. Truly, it is like being in a Harry Potter movie.Perhaps we’re too accustomed to flash and pomp, and forget that treasures like this STILL do serve a purpose for all ages.(Do note they offer Movie Nights, Dino Snores for Grown-ups, Crime Scene Live, and IMAX movies for additional fun at a price.)But having said that, it’s time for small changes/improvements. There IS ample room for additional interactive exhibits and absolutely fix the two-dozen or so dirty cases and broken buttons. The lack of attention to detail and upkeep did not make me want to donate funds. (What are you doing with the income from gift shops, cafés and donors?) And, please, ban selfie-sticks.In the end, it’s not a must-do in the city of smoke…but no doubt you’ll see something interesting, if not, leave and walk over to the Museum Ice Rink and experience the thrill of skating surrounded by fairy lights nestled in frost-trees, with the smell of mulled wine and toasted marshmallows in the air!",What a disappointment
"February 3, 2018","Booked a special trip just to see the museum. I found the place full of screaming children and couldn't move for people taking photos on their phones. Couldn't read the labels or see the exhibits properly as it was so dark, a lot of lights weren't working and the cases were filthy. Even the dinosaurs were covered in dust. The tacky shops were a complete rip-off. Thank goodness for the V&A next door! That was properly lit - but if art and textiles can be lit properly, why can't fossils be ! (and they won't fade!)",My favourite museum EVER
"February 3, 2018","It's free, a stunning building and an interactive place to learn. Perfect for any age group to explore - to do it any justice allow all day ",Girlie 50th Birthday Celebrations!
"February 2, 2018",We did not have long to stop here so we all chose one thing we wanted to do and did that. Could spend all day here and not see everything.  It is such an amazing place to go and free too (donations accepted).  ,Fun for all the family
"January 27, 2018",We have visited many times and have always seen something different! Whatever ages of your party there is something for all!,Well laid out 
"January 26, 2018","Very well laid out, interesting, interactive and enjoyable. Dinosaurs section particularly interesting. Only negative some of the interactve screens not working.",School trip
"January 24, 2018",Topic on Darwin. Very educational talks and he even had a teacher getting involved in the tours. It’s a very big museum so seeing it all in one day willBe very exhausting so try to plan out the day,Very impressive
"January 24, 2018","This museum is huge with so much to see, all of it impressive. Give yourself at least three hours if you want to see it all. ",A Week's Worth of Wonders
"January 23, 2018",We spent two consecutive days at the Natural History Museum and still were not able to see it all.  Two hours in the rocks and minerals gallery could have been a whole day if we had the time.  The gemstone collection is breathtaking.  Take in the architectural details of the building itself.  A highlight of our time in London,Simply my favourite building on Earth
"January 23, 2018","I love the Natural History Museum. We try and visit as often as possible. It's the most gorgeous building, I love how the animal carvings match the content of the building itself. The new whale skeleton is interesting although not quite an impactful as the old dinosaur model in the main hintze hall. Beware! Its always incredibly busy at the weekend, so you better to go during the week.",temple of history and science
"October 13, 2017","this is really temple of history, beginning with skeletons of  dinosaurs and  finishing future things. There is also a lot of interesting activities such as- interactive games about human body, brains and etc. ",Allow plenty of time to take it all in
"October 13, 2017",Love national museums in London. There is no entrance fee to see some great exhibits. The building is as interesting as the exhibits. Has a snack bar inside too. The queue appears to be long but it moves along fairly quickly.,A must!
"October 12, 2017",London museum of Natural History is an amazing experience for both adults and children! It's a perfect opportunity to make your children get interested in learning and science!(check also the London science museum!),First trip for my toddler...
"October 11, 2017",My little princess loves dinosaurs! So for her to see the animatronics of the T. rex it was a big hit.The rest is really for older kids etc etc but that alone got us a big hit for the trip.Some of the rest was a bit tired. Looked like a bunch of exhibits needed a face lift and too many times things were out of service.Some of it was also too 1990’s needed to be brought into the 21st century. Amazing building and facility so deserves to be more wow factor for the exhibits. Too many stuffed animals in a glass cabinet!Come on GB we can do better than this!!,Recommend an early start!
"October 10, 2017","A little hesitant to start with about how the visit might go, with a two and four year old in tow. We got there early avoiding big queues and having an easier flow through the obligatory security screening. From the entrance and the giant whalebone overhead and the dinosaurs at the side our charges were in awe!It continued from exhibit to exhibit holding their interest and attention far better than we could have expected. Don't get me wrong, we  older folk enjoyed it just as much. Easy to traverse,, no chance of getting lost. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The cafe was Ok too, and the facilities good and easy to find.",WOW !
"October 9, 2017","my son's love this place , always very interesting , always well laid out , one day is not enough , spend a hour or days , a great place for adults or kids .",World class museum & free admission 
"October 6, 2017",Every time the wife and I turned a corner we were delighted but interesting and impressive exhibits . A must go to and you can eat there as well . Food is second to none . ,Great
"October 5, 2017","Iv been wanting to go to this museum for ages, and when i arrived i wasn't disappointed. Admission was free. There was plenty to see, we got around in a few hours. The animal exhibitions were great and interesting along with the geography area (space,earthquakes,volcano). It was busy and very warm inside but didn't stop me enjoying what was to see. It was easily accessible by tube and the queue wasn't very long to get in either.  The dinosaur area was slightly boring in my opinion. There is defiantly lots to see and do and would be great for children.",Wildlife Photographer of the Year
"October 4, 2017",Visited the museum solely for the WPOY exhibition which was not free but totally worth the visit. The entire building was evacuated due to an unknown reason while there and they honoured our tickets for a revisit. ,So fun!!
"October 3, 2017","This museum is lovely for kids, but for adults as well, the whales and the dinosaurs in particular are amazing, and all free admission! It is a tourist attraction in South Kensington, there are loads of people almost too many, but its a 'must see' place! Theres is a cafe thats quite nice too, expensive though, and also a small shop that sells books, toys, clothes!",Boring!
"December 8, 2017","I was excited to go here since it was free and I would be able to see fossils and real skeletons of dinosaurs, however I was left disappointed. I do not think that that they have real skeletons of dinosaurs. There was too much fakeness in the museum as they just had artificial models of animals. That, for me, was what made the visit a big let down since nothing was authentic as you would expect in an actual museum. Not all of the museum is free as there are some areas where you have to buy a ticket in order to get in. Also, I felt that the museum is more ideal for families, young kids and teenage students. I will never return back here again. I think a zoo is better off!",So much to see
"December 8, 2017","Even if you don't care about aby of the exhibitions the building along is worth seeing. As the museum is free (although you're encouraged to make a donation, which you really should as this is a great place). Even if some of the regular exhibitions are a little old the museum manages to capture your imagination and gets you interested. There are a number of things you can do, try, test that will entertain and teach regardless of whether you're an adult or a kid. Because the place is so big is doesn't feel crowded. There are so many difference shows and areas of natural history that you are bound to find some to your liking ... and most likely you'll discover that you have too little time on your hands. Also I dare you to count the number of 'wow' you hear from amazed kids.",Great Exhibits
"December 7, 2017","Going to the museum is easy, just get off the tube at South Kensington Stn. The entrance is free except for a few exhibits. There's plenty of exhibits and you really need to plan, else you can get lost going round and round.. its like a maze in there.The dinosaur and ancient animal fossils were Great! There's sections for children as well. Allocate enough time there..4 hours not enough to see all. Will come back again",Had a good time here
"December 5, 2017",I haven't been to a natural history museum in a while . This was very nice- only thing I didn't like- The admission did not include some of the new ( and what I thought would have been interesting ) exhibits . You had to pay extra- which I did not do.,The building itself is already worth of visit
"December 4, 2017",Natural History Museum is probably one of the most beautiful buildings in London. It's already by itself worth of visiting. Museum itself is huge and there is no point even trying to see it all in once. I really enjoyed the animal history on my visit!,Fantastic 
"December 2, 2017","Wow, what a fabulous place to visit. The building itself is quite spectacular. Visited with my son while staying in London for a mid week break. We spent many hours here as there is plenty to see. By far the best museum in London. Highly recommend a visit if you are in London. ",You could spend a whole day here
"December 1, 2017","This place remains an amazing example of Britain at its very best. A wonderful collection of natural history exhibits, housed in exquisite surroundings.",One of the best museums in the world
"November 29, 2017","Some of the best exhibits, set in a gorgeous building, with no entry fee. What more could you ask for? When I visit museums in other countries I travel to, which are very rarely free, I'm always underwhelmed compared to the museums London has to offer.I've been going here probably once a year since I was a child and there's always something new to see. The 'late' nights are fun if you're over 18 - no screaming kids running around and alcohol is served!",Good visit of geology area
"November 28, 2017","I went there mainly interested to the geological sector and it is simply awesome. At Sunday, full of families ( mainly at the dinosaurs)!",Incredible Museam With Everything You Could Think Of!!!!!
"November 28, 2017",We have been to the natural history museum multiple times and it has NEVER failed to impress us! It has everything from animals to mummys and it is perfect for any families day out.,Better than expected
"November 18, 2017","Exhibitions range from really modern to old and dusty – but that made the experience charming. I would advice to come as early as possible, it got really crowded after a while. The café had good pricing and friendly service.",Amazing.
"November 18, 2017","I actually have nothing to say. The title explain everything. Free entrance museum that would be worthy of a 30 pounds entrance ticket. Except for a couple section that were close cause they were working on them, every single corner of this museum will leave you amazed. If you're coming to London this is a MUST see. ",A pefect place for children
"November 18, 2017",We visited the museum last week and my six years old son couldn't get enough of this. He loved it. Beautiful building inside and outside and every room keeps a surpise for everyone. And of course there is a lovely place to enjoy your coffee or your food.,A great day out for adults and kids.
"November 16, 2017","The Natural History Museum is wonderful for any age. It's always a good day out! You need to dedicate a few hours to it, but it's worth looking round all of it, there's so much variety.",Great place
"November 14, 2017","visited the museum and was very impressed. I did not have all the time that i would have liked to spend there, but from what i have seen it is a great place to see and learn about a lot of things. Great place for youngsters, and school children, which there were many during my visit.",Not what i expected
"November 12, 2017","Maybe i had the wrong type of idea in mind but the museum just didn't really have the amount of stuff i thought it would and so was left disappointed. Don't get me wrong, for a free museum it's brilliant and has a fantastic section on dinosaurs! There's plenty of shops and eateries to use too. The worse part of the trip was the millions of school children just running wild all over the place with the teachers just leaving them to it, but what can you do? ",Amazing!!
"November 10, 2017",We spent all day there and still not enough time to see it all. The building is gorgeous and we most enjoyed the mineral and gem exhibits. Tons of families and kids and I could see they really enjoyed the dinosaurs and whales exhibits. We took a break and had cake and coffee and the quality was very good. What a special place.,Most Interesting of Museums-Several visits needed
"November 10, 2017","This is a wonderful experience and has exhibits that many museums around the world lock away as they believe the public are not interested. London museums are free but they had a tout at the door trying to extract 5 pounds from me.We only spent 3 hours here and will  return next visit, so choose the exhibits you want to see and go for it. The dinosaurs were fantastic, but make sure you read everything on offer so that you can learn some new facts",A wonderful way to lose time
"November 9, 2017","We went here just to fill in a morning before our flight and lost ourselves here. We had intended to visit the Wildlife Photo exhibit but simply ran out of time; there IS that much to see. Some of the exhibits are now starting to fade in colour (grey and white Great Panda!) but the exhibits are exhaustive. Considering that it is free, this is one place you should definitely visit. ",AMAZING PLACE
"November 9, 2017",Such an amazing place.  One visit was not enough. So much to see. Love the animatronic dinosaur. Long lines to get in but worth the wait. Can’t wait to go back!,Fabulous for everyone!
"November 2, 2016",We took our 13-year old grandson and he loved it and so did we. There were so many interactive and hands-on activities.  We learned so much.  We went twice and spent about six hours in total and we could have spent more time there. A wonderful experience!,Interesting and educational!
"October 31, 2016","Do make it a point to drop by this museum that takes you on a journey through time. Highly educational given that it houses an extensive collection of exhibits from the natural world, starting from pre-historic times. Visited in May 2015.",Great visit
"October 26, 2016",Busiest week of the year they said at the entrance!  Exceptional museum. A lot of activities for children. And the staff is helpful and friendly,Overrated and overcrowded
"October 25, 2016",Had a museum day in londom. Chose this museum as a grest start due to its association with David Attenborough. Love the idea of the museum but not a fan of the 1hr wait in line to get inside or the then very crowded inside of the museum. Cant argue with the free entrance fee.  Most people just seemed to be sitting around on floors eating and resting. In hindsight would of spent most of the day at the British museum and just ducked in for a quickish look around. Would of liked a behind the scenes tour and would of been happy to pay to see it.,Natural Museum London
"October 24, 2016","Great Museum for Kids perfect. Lot of Dinos from old history, thousands of years ago. Expext long waiting Slots to get inside in morning time",Fantastic Visit
"October 23, 2016","Visited the museum on a recent Monday afternoon and had a great time, especially with our 2 toddlers.  They LOVED it.  They had a great time seeing all the animals and especially the dinosaurs.  It was a little busy .. but still plenty of room to let them walk/run about between exhibits.  Kids or not, this is a brilliant museum and a definite visit if in London.",best museum ever!! 
"October 22, 2016",had so much fun! very interesting and a nice place to educate yourself and spend your time! would love to go back there! ,"Much to see, and kids will love it!"
"October 21, 2016","And it's free!! We went there with our three young kids (ages 3, 6, and 8), and they all loved it. The highlight of our time there was the dinosaur exhibit for sure. We spent most of our time there. There is lots to see, so plan on spending a good chunk of time there or just pick and choose what rooms/exhibits you want to see, as we did based on time constraints. It does get crowded, but the line to get in does move. Just be prepared to wait in line for a bit and the earlier you go, the better.",A true British gem
"October 20, 2016","We have been coming here for years as a family, often with grandparents, extended family and friends in tow. The building is an architectural delight and would be worth visiting for its own merit as such! The dinosaur exhibition is of course one of the main highlights; there are so many other amazing exhibits too, that are explained in a really interesting and engaging way - for children of all ages and for us adults too!We have been to many of the special exhibitions, the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibitions and the Butterfly house, when it's on. All of them have been so very interesting and intellectually stimulating. There is even a little nature garden with educational aspects to it to the left of the building and of course the lawns to picnic on, should you wish to in good weather.A top tip from our family would be to take the annual membership if you're likely to go more than once, or with a larger family/friends. For a very reasonable price, you receive quarterly magazines, including for the children and free entry to all of the paid special exhibitions, of which there are several each year. There are several other perks and for us, jumping the huge queues, during holiday season and walking straight up the front stairs, had to be one of the most enticing!The proximity to other favourite, iconic museums, the National Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert museum, is another draw as you can split up if people have different interests, or spend literally all day in 2 or 3 of them. Wishing you a wonderful visit.",Enjoyed my visit
"October 19, 2016","Although I visited the museum by my self, I would very recommend it to families with children.I'll sure bring my young boy with me when we'll visit London together next time.Very interestingand exciting stuff  for people who interested in nature and animals.","Much to see, and kids will love it!"

"October 18, 2016","My first visit was when I was 3 or 4 and I was impressed then my nan told a story about the skeleton dinosaur coming to life ( in 1976 - way before 'Night at the Museum!') and I am glad to say 'Diny' is still the centrepiece. I was a little disappointed that we now have to follow the rope system to view him so visit 'off peak' if you can! I've been a few times since the 1970's, with my own son, and it's still a fascinating place, full of the nostalgia of the Victorian era with the 'things in glass cases' and traditional grandeur. It's exhausting and you need to do it in two halves - you definitely need more than one visit because after a while you get 'museum fatigue' so pick your favourite sections to really focus on if this is a one off visit! You have to queue to get in at any time but if it looks daunting don't worry - it moves fast.",Educational
"October 18, 2016","We went to the Natural History Museum on a somewhat chilly day, so it was an excellent place to be.  There was a special butterfly exhibit on the grounds, all within a heated tent (and it was warm - I'm from Florida and had to take off my jacket).  The exhibits in the museum were very well done.  There is an outdoor garden and at the time we visited there were grazing sheep there taking care of the ""lawn"" - no gas powered mowers here.  Quite enjoyable, followed by the V&A Museum just across the street.",Kids..... Big and Little
"October 18, 2016","This was amazing and fun and informative. The dinosaurs, the special exhibits, the actual buildings and the grounds..... Do not miss this venue.","Great visit, but don't go to the restaurant if your on a tight schedule "
"October 17, 2016","The museum was pretty impressive. We had to queue for about half hour for entry (as expected for a free museum) on a Sunday morning. It's well laid and information for both adults and children alike. The building itself is just stunning, just look at the detail in the brickwork whilst waiting in the queue, it's beautiful. We went to the restaurant for dinner whilst there. Whilst the food was ok, the service was lacking and on 2 occasions I had to ask for our desserts to be delivered, we were sat in the corner and we seemed to be invisible for nearly an hour!  ",Great free attraction 
"October 17, 2016",If you want a free educational excursion this is the place to go wonderful exhibits and if you aren't too sure there are staff to point you in the right direction.  This place is close to the tube and buses,Awesome
"October 16, 2016","Housed in a stunningly beautiful vast building, entry is free.There is so much to see and do you will need at least 4 hours to run around like an adult child and there are plenty of restaurants and shops to make up for that lack of entrance fee. There are live experiences and educational talks throughout the day, from toddler age upwards, children will be amazed with the experience.I would recommend arriving by public transport as parking in the area will cost a lot.",Funny!
"October 15, 2016",Very funny!!! We spent three hours as a blink. It is also very educative for school children and teenagers. The dinosaurs appear as if they were going to catch you!,Use the side entrance!
"August 24, 2016","We visited on a Sunday lunchtime and there were crowds spilling out of the tube station to get to the Museum. There were some museum guides advising to use the side entrance as there were no queues - and we walked straight in! Inside it was really busy, but we got some great pictures by the Diplodocus. We walked around the Dino exhibit just after 3pm and it was less crowded there. The animatronic T Rex was very noisy and a great watch. The human body exhibit was enjoyable, but some of the interactive parts were broken.The blue whale was impressive but it was too busy to see properly. My two children were quite taken with a very 80s interactive demo of how heat affects humans and camels.We will definitely return here, outside of school holidays when we can have a good look around with hopefully less crowds! We are so lucky to live in a country where gems like this museum are free for all to attend. ",Great place for 3- to 7 year-olds
"August 20, 2016","My kids love the NHM. The dinosaur skeletons, the mammal and bird galleries, the creepy-crawly and the all rest is just a big treat for young kids.  And it's free!  If you go there in the winter, you can also enjoy the ice-ring.  Highly recommended.",It is huge
"August 18, 2016",Don't plan to do anything else the same day as you come to this place because it is gigantic. Me and my husband spent 4 hours there and couldn't finish the whole thing. ,One of the Great Museums of the World
"August 18, 2016",This is one of the finest museums in the world. Filled with natural history exhibits that delight and surprize. The main hall is dominated by a skeleton of a huge dinosaur that somehow fits the architecture of the building. The dinosaur exhibit itself is filled with information and anamatronic displays that make you believe that you just stepped into the world of 75 million years ago. Modern day animals are not neglected either and the skeleton of a blue whale hanging over your head to give you a sense of the tremendous size of these creatures. A London must-see!,Worth a visit
"August 18, 2016","I recommend the visit even if you're not particularly interested in natural history: the building is awesome, both outside and inside. Admittance is free, we just had to stand in a queue for about 20 minutes, and it's high season. It's one of those huge museums you should visit more than once to see it all at ease, but if, like me, you're staying in London for a short holiday you need to walk around to have a general idea. Kids appreciate the section on dinosaurs very much, and the hall with the big mammals. For adults, I would recommend also going on the second floor to see the giant sequoia section and the ceiling decoration, then go down a few steps to the first floor, walk along the minerals rooms and stop at the end: in The Vault you can see diamonds, stones and meteorites.I liked also the animals in vases in the Darwin section.We were too tired to appreciate the section on human kind or to go out in the garden, next time.",Amazing day out with our three young boys! 
"August 16, 2016",What a great place! Our three very young lads had a ball.  We were there 6 hours! Very helpful friendly staff! There's something for everyone. Highly recommended. ,Great place and so much to see
"August 15, 2016","we visited mid week and so glad we got there when it opened , only had to wait 20 mins and in by 10:10 , got in the dinosaur bit and managed to get round a few areas before it started to fill up.Have to say we ate in the museum and was impressed with quality and price , same thing with the shop , plenty of things to buy that were not over priced . The queue when we left at midday was crazy so be warned and go as early as you can manage so worth it !!",Beautiful Building
"August 14, 2016",What a beautiful setting for a museum!  We spent hours wandering around and viewing the exhibits.  This is a very crowded venue so be prepared to wait in line to get in.  The exhibits were geared more for older children and adults.  Admission is free so you can't really complain.,Busy But A Must See
"August 14, 2016","I travelled here during February half term which I found out on the day is their busiest week in the year. If you want to avoid the queues, get there as close to 10am as possible and just be prepared for a bit of waiting around. We stayed for around 5 hours and only got around 1/3 of the museum, partly due to it being so busy but really down to the fact that it is just so vast. A fantastic and spell binding place, especially for the children. ",Beautiful museum
"August 11, 2016","The Natural History museum is in an incredible building which has tonnes of character. It was very busy when we visited, a bit too busy (about 1pm) would be best to go after 3pm to have the best experience. For a free museum it is well worth a visit. ",Great displays
"October 10, 2016",Very interesting and informative displays. Having visited loads of dinosaur sections of museums still found new and interesting facts. ,wonderful museum - and available to all without charge
"October 9, 2016",Our last day in London was rainy and a perfect day to explore a museum.  It is all interesting but we particularly liked the section on earthquakes and volcanoes.,You cant go wrong here.
"October 9, 2016","What can i say, this place is wonderful.  You can easy spend a whole day here if you spend your time looking over the exhibits.  Easy to get to, right next to a tube entrance.      Make sure you go in via the old main entrance so you get to see ""Dippy"" the huge Brontosaurus.I could keep going back here time and time again.  Take the kids, the wife, the girl or boyfriend and enjoy a day there. ",Great building 
"October 9, 2016","This was the first museum I ever visited in London, probably stimulated by my nieces good review. I really loved the gothic building! Not particularly a science person but could also appreciate some of the content  ;) Avoid the weekend if you can, even in January it was packed with people. ",Such a Cool Place
"October 8, 2016","I have to admit, I love natural history museums so I'm a little bias. I've been to the ""biggies"" in the US and while each are different and special, the London Museum really isn't to be missed. The is a big place, plan to walk a lot and spend several hours during your visit. If you visit any of the special exhibits (the photography awards are not to be missed and start on Oct 21st) you should probably plan to spend 4-5 hours here. The Darwin museum attached is a really interesting part of the visit. Take some time just to take in the architecture of the buildings. Free to get in, special exhibits have a cost.",The most beautiful Natural History Museum in Europe
"October 8, 2016","You will like this museum because there are so many things to see, to learn, to play... yes playing :-) (you'll know why if you're going there).This museum are good for children, students, adults.",Brilliant fun 
"October 8, 2016","Great place to spend a blustery day, get there early because the question are insane!! Once in the architecture of the actual building itself is amazing like something from Harry Potter! Instantly greeted with a dinosaur skeleton and the other rooms have just as much to offer.There are rooms full of books and taxidermy animals, rows of shells and crystals in wooden glass fronted cases and a mechanical dinosaur which the children seem to love.Brilliant for kids and big kids alike!!! ",Be aware before booking for Dino-Snore
"October 7, 2016","My son and Grandson (age 6) visited Dino-Snore on 24th September '16.  Added in to the £60 each fee for the overnight stay was the return train fare from Wales - not an inexpensive adventure.  Doors opened at 7.30pm to FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE!  An evening 'snack' had to be taken from home, plus sleeping bags, toiletries etc.  Staff to customer ratio was 2 to 50. The breakfast provided was a very inadequate muffin, tiny yogurt, a cup of tea for grown-ups and a carton of apple juice for children.  Toilet facilities had to be queued for - particularly last thing at night and first thing in the morning.  Basically, it was a very expensive, unsatisfactory overnight stay, doing things that could have been done for free during the day.  Numbers were overwhelming and a rip-off for the price.","""Lots Of Cool Stuff"""
"October 6, 2016","Although I don't share a lot of the explanations the museum puts forward in their exhibits, I still found lot to fascinate me and my boys. The Prehistoric Gallery was very interesting, as well as the galleries on marine mammals and all the other animals. My boys thought it was pretty cool and they enjoyed themselves a lot.",This is an awesome museum!
"October 6, 2016","Lots to see, very well laid out in logical format. Many hands on displays and fun things for the kids to do. Great learning experience. Could easily spend all day there.",WOW! My Favorite
"August 11, 2016","If you like nature, Dinosaurs, Darwin this is a must goAmazing place!Save at least 4 hours to spend inside, you will need it, this place is just awesome! Unbelievable!!!!",Recommend the David Attenborough VirtualReality Experience
"August 11, 2016","The NHM is wonderful.  We wanted to avoid the queues so arrived at 3pm; pretty much walked in!  We had booked fore the David Attenborough virtual reality trip (Book online) and it was amazing---throughly recommend.The great thing about the NHM is you can simply 'dip in and dip out' so children don't get bored and over-faced.  Like eating an elephant, the NHM is best consumed in small chunks..!",Amazing
"August 11, 2016",We arrived late and could only fit in one exhibition.  We went for the dinosaurs.  It was fab and I will definitely be back.,Great for a late night trip
"August 7, 2016",I happened to be able to go at 9:00 on a Friday night which was perfect for me.  Intense science experience.  Great dinosaurs.  Loved the earthquake experience.  Long queues and kids during the day so lucking into a night it was open was great for me.,Great for Children
"August 6, 2016",A great museum and very good for children with lots of activities and displays aimed at a younger audience.  Huge queue to get in - it took about 40 minutes to get inside which was far too long.  Seasonal areas do cost more and during our visit there was a large greenhouse type of building that you had to pay to go into but were then surrounded by butterflies. ,Brilliant for children of all ages
"August 5, 2016",Took our 5 year old here for the first time. When you get there expect a large queue to get in. I'm guessing you need to get there about 9:30 to get in quickly when it opens at 10. We got there about 10:15. That said the queue did move fairly quickly. We were in by 11:00. Inside you are face to face with a diplodocus. Expect children to start getting a little bit excited.We only had a short time to spend in there so naturally we headed for the dinosaurs. This is probably the most visited area and it showed. It was very busy but you get to see everything a small boy would want. We had lunch here. The cafe in the entrance hall was pretty poor. There was a choice of ham sandwiches or you could have ham sandwiches. No other sandwiches to be seen. That's not really useful when you have a child who won't eat ham. I'm sure vegetarians were thrilled as well. So we went to the restaurant which was great. The others went round the creepy crawlies while I stayed a safe distance away. It sounded like a great exhibition if you like that kind of thing. There is a handling area which we didn't have time to go to but we did get to hold a dinosaur bone. Highlight of my trip but a bit lost on a small child. The museum is massive. We hardly scratched the surface. To go round it all properly would take days or probably weeks. A must for children who love dinosaurs. ,Loved it
"August 4, 2016",What can I say.  I loved it.  You could spend days in here.  Great for school age children.  Lots to keep their attention and interest,A Must See in London
"August 3, 2016","Iconic museum. Brilliant and magic space, starting with its beautiful building. Its a fantastic experience, specially with children. Undoubtelly a must see in London.",Excellent experience 
"August 1, 2016","Loved this, lots to see and interact with. They even have a life sized t rex. We went with teens and they found it just as interesting. ",Great every time
"August 1, 2016",We live 5mins away and go quite a few times a year as we all love the place. Obviously Dino are is the highlight and the Blue Whale. You can liaise a day here easily. ,Great Museum
"May 19, 2016","I had a great time at this museum and loved it more than I expected. The dinosaur exhibition was awesome! The fact that it is also free to get in is a bonus. Definitely worth a visit, particularly if its a rainy day!",Natural History Museum
"May 19, 2016","Wonderful museum for the whole family, young and old.  We have visited many times over the years.  I would strongly recommend for those who have never been before, especially with young families.",You must not miss it with or without kids
"May 17, 2016","Probably the best natural history museum in the world with plenty of activities, unique specimen, videos, experiments and much more. You would never leave and would go back over and over again.",Wonderful Museum!
"May 12, 2016","This is a top notch museum with fantastic exhibits in an exceptional building.  Because it was so close to our hotel, we made this our first stop upon arriving in town.  The grassy open space makes for a perfect picnic spot, but there are places to buy food inside, too.  We spent only a few hours here and skipped the very expensive butterfly exhibit (at an extra cost), but we loved this stop and would recommend it to anyone - especially families with younger children.",dragged here but glad i went
"May 11, 2016","my girlfriend wanted to go here when we were on a short break to London, cant say it was on my priorty but I was really glad I did very very interesting and informative, plenty of fun facts and games to do as well, kids would love it.",Nice and interesting
"May 9, 2016","A lot's of dinos (sceletons, modells) and natural stuff (birds, volcano, life size whale modell, etc.) can be seen here.Especially for kids it's top level fun for sure.",Crowds - but dinosaurs are the draw!
"May 6, 2016","I entered from the Exhibition Rd (side) entrance and went straight up (dramatic entrance!) to the volcanoes and earthquakes exhibit, which was well done, especially the Kobe Earthquake simulator. I then went through the other floors on that side, but as I moved westward toward the dinosaurs and other fossils, it really began to get exciting. What a collection, and what a setting. Don't miss the full-sized animated model tyrannosaurus as it goes through its day!",Very interesting for all ages
"April 28, 2016",The offer is surprisingly large and varied for a free entry! The dinosaur section is especially well designed. The building is beautiful and carries the feel of the institution. ,Beautiful 
"April 28, 2016","Leaving in London and having a 4 year old, we've been here quite a few time and it's always a joy to visit and discover something new each time. The coffee place is good with delicious cakes. They also have kids lunch boxes. Amazingly rich architecture and contents. A must see.",Next door to V&A
"April 28, 2016","Try to go this is also one of the best, it is free and if you go this summer [16] in font in a big white tent a butterfly room.","So much to see,and its free."
"June 9, 2016","Great place to go,with kids or without and best of all its free admission.You need to leave yourself a day to see everything as there is so much to see and do.There are heaps of eating places inside with a variety of food choices.Get there when the doors open,get yourself a map and enjoy a wonderful museum.",For the kids
"June 5, 2016","This is a fairly old fashioned museum and, while it is probably worth the visit with kids, as an adult, I would definitely not queue to visit again.",Great museum
"June 3, 2016","We went on a busy holiday weekend. We were pleased with the quality and amount of attractions, small line, and cost (free!!). Definitely make time to see ancient artifacts!",Building or the artifacts--which is more amazing?
"June 3, 2016","Awesome, awesome awesome.Not sure if the artifacts or the building is most impressive.Fossils, taxidermy, full animal and dino replicas & skeletons, etc. Also has a first edition of ""Origen of species""  Thank you Charley D!",Outstanding museum with an amazing dinosaur collection 
"May 31, 2016","My family and I visited the Natural History Museum on the May Bank Holiday Weekend.This is a fantastic museum for both kids and adults alike. The dinosaur collection is excellent, and they also have a roaring, moving T Rex!There is a comprehensive mammal section including a huge whale. There is also an escalator through the earth to levels including an earthquake simulator.All the above are free. There are also a number of additional exhibitions that incur a charge. We went to the butterfly exhibition (live butterflies in a tent) which cost £22 for a family ticket. It's a little pricey for what it is, but everyone thoroughly enjoyed. If you live in London there are some membership options that are reasonably priced and provide access to the paid exhibits, queue jump entry and 10 passes to give to friends and family to have free access to all the chargeable exhibits. Overall this is one of the best museums I have ever visited and I heartily recommend it to all, and especially if you have kids who like dinosaurs. ",Disappointing visit
"May 29, 2016","Went back to the natural history museum after a 15 year gap and was very sad to see that most of the exhibitions haven't been modernised or refreshed with the most up to date information on subjects. Many of the interactive displays were incredibly old and dated and were from the 80/90'sHowever we did take a behind the scenes tour which was fantastic, showing preservation methods preserved fish/Mammals including a 15ft squid along with Darwin's personal collection.General facilities of the museum were good with the cafes offering decent food.",Very suitable for children
"May 27, 2016","Excellent museum with an exhibition about dinosaurs (there is a full size model of the T-Rex), stuffed animals and minerals.",Natural History Meuseam
"May 27, 2016",Good for the kids. It has a dino section. I recommend you bring the kids there. On Exibition Road and Cromwell Road.,Best ever museum
"May 25, 2016","To start with, it's a stunning building. If you have children then you owe it to them to visit the dinosaurs. Not just skeletons (awe inspiring as the are) but animated T Rex! Thrilling for all. Just an adult? Then explore the educational stuff - human history is a must see. The other good thing is that there are really good places to eat, varied menu, inexpensive and plenty of room. When you're absolutely exhausted but educated you can head for nearby Kensington Gardens for rest.",FREE to do in London. Great for dinosaur lovers.
"May 24, 2016","If you are a fan of dinosaurs this is a must see! There is a exhibition soley dedicated to dinosaurs. It is full of interesting facts for adults too and not just for children. There are real dinosaur bones as well as models and animated models. There are also plenty of models you can touch -models of dino teeth, skulls and tusks. I Particularly enjoyed the mammal exhibition with stuffed animals(not as creepy as it sounds) and huge model of a blue whale. Very educational in a fun way.  ",Could Spend Days Here
"June 22, 2016","You have to be a museum person to enjoy this, obviously. I wouldn't say it's for everyone because I appreciate that not everyone enjoys walking around and looking at things. :) BUT. It's one of the most wonderful museums I've been to, and I couldn't believe it was free!! We paid for the butterfly exhibit, which was absolutely, completely magical and a must-do for anyone with a sense of whimsy. We also did the 3D water movie (sorry - I can't recall the name), but it wasn't that worth it. Cool concept, but could have passed. The stone exhibit was awesome, and the gems were gorgeous. We spent hours, could have spent hours more.",Great exibhits but maybe more interaction?
"June 21, 2016","Not my first visit to the Natural history museum, and probably not my last. The exhibits are very impressive al though some parts (i.e. stuffed animals) look a bit dusty. It´s a great place to bring kids, especially between 4-10 yrs. Don´t be put off by the possibly long que outside. It moves quicker than you think.",Amazing
"June 19, 2016",This is a fantastic place for kids and grownups alike. Obviously the dinosaurs are the main attraction but the other areas are also fascinating - however don't expect to see it all in a day or even 10. We spent the afternoon there and made it around two areas. Architecturally the building is also stunning! ,Visit of the Natural History Museum
"June 19, 2016","it is very interesting for any age people. It is possible to learn about human being evolution, animal species, types of earthquakes.",This is a must
"June 18, 2016","Absolutely beautiful building and we are glad we came here to visit.  Our children really loved all the exibitis and are still talking about everything viewed, these memories will last them a lifetime - stunning.",The kids absolutely love every part of it!
"June 17, 2016","I have visited couple of times with my boys/6,8 and11 yrs/ up to now, but the museum is so big that we'll defenatey make another visit. Every time there they are amaized and find it interesting. The building itself is gorgeous, when I step in I really love the feeling just walking inside. If You think that You can see everything in a day - that's absolutely not possible. I plan every our visit - looking at the map of the museum and choosing few exhibitions. First time there we visited the Dinosaurs and the Mammals. Next time we visited the Earth zone. The kids absolutely love every part of it!",Just pause before you go in.....
"June 16, 2016","Please take the time before you go in to look at this superb example of Victorian architecture. Finished in ceramic tiles to resist the then prevalent air pollution superb neo-Norman arches over the main south entrance, carved animals and beasts, a well proportioned building which is a gem in its own right.Sadly as so often happens money ran out too soon so the two additional wings were never built and the internal decoration was not completed.Inside is a collection to delight any child and every adult, take your time, at least two hours is a minimum need.Looks, cafes all good tho not cheap",Just Go there!
"June 12, 2016","Absolutely amazing... One of the best museums in the world, and FREE (although I encourage everyone to leave a suitable donation if you enjoy it).We try to take our children every time we visit London! There is something for everyone. The architecture of the building alone is worth the visit, but it also has loads of wonderful exhibits, and is very well laid out in individual halls so you can easily make your way to the ones you are most interested in.TOP TIP - use the side entrance to avoid the queues. Coming up from the tube station take your photos of the building then head up and along the street above/behind you to the little used side entrance. As long as it isn't school holidays (lots of locals in the know) - the side entrance normally has NO QUEUE, even when there are 100's of people lined up for the front entrance.",Good activity
"June 10, 2016","We enjoyed the visit.But we where also lucky to see the Butterfly exhibition outside. We recommend that one. We been in the valley of butterflies in Rhodes Island, we did see only few butterflies. Here we did walk amongst a thousand beautiful ones. The museum itself is maybe a bit outdated on how they present things, and more fun for school aged children, but we made it fun anyways for our small ones 2&5 years. Educational for us adults that need to take some dust of our school day's. Nice cafe and rest areas. The stairs can be a bit trouble for the stroller, and elevators a bit crowded at the popular day's. The building and architecture itself is also very appealing and atmosphere as it should in a museum. Free entrance to museum. Butterflies costs a few pounds pr. person . But defiantly worth every penny. Enjoy a good old museum, we recommend it.  ",A visit to the Sensational  Butterfly exhibition was high on our list of priorities
"June 9, 2016","We heard so much about this wonderful exhibition in the center of London. It would please the family in particular my 6 year-old granddaughter. In the end I think the adults enjoyed it even more. The butterflies are contained in a specially constructed double skin tent which, (when on entering,  you'll feel the  damp and  hot air and beware, camera lens gets fogged up initially),   is sprinkled  with colourful and exotic fluttering butterflies.There are plenty of signs informing the visitor all there's to know about the transformation of the chrysalis into a beautiful butterfly,. Allow yourself to be at one with these beautiful little creatures which come primarily fronm  Africa, Southeast Asia and North and South America,",Breath taking
"April 28, 2016",Finally get to see fossils of prehistoric animals. This museum is filled with lots of exhibits. Spent close to 3-4 hours around the museum checking out all the display. Worth the visit!,Fantastic view.
"April 28, 2016",It is top level of museum area in Europe(I think).Every thing are arranged for good feeling in this NHM.Thank for chance to see this marvelous trip.,A Museum that will amaze anyone!
"April 27, 2016","This Museum is a good reason to spend some hours from your visit to London. As I didn't know the size of this museum, Ι thought 1-2 hours would be enough to see everything in it, but i was so amazed and intrested by the exhibits that i spent 4 hours. You get knowledge and history from all of the species on earth, the planet, natural phenomena such earthquakes and so much more. Great rooms and spaces such the one with sea mammals and the dinosaurs. I was really amazed! Sure, in my future visit to London city i will spend some time to see again Natural History Museum!",Amazing 
"April 26, 2016","All the tourist need to go in Natural History Museum, it's incredible! It was a good experience there, but you need came really early because it's to big, and in my opinion just one day isn't much to see all the details, all the pieces at the museum. ",A London must do
"April 23, 2016","Avoid weekends due to crowds but if you have no choice, line up just before 10am openings. Spectacular interactive exhibits and a great place for children. A visit to ""The Restaurant"" will break the day up with excellent food, prompt service, at a reasonable price & alternate diets catered for.",Guaranteed fun for kids
"April 23, 2016",You can't go wrong for such a wide range of interesting things to do and see here. From volcano and earthquake action to the classic dinosaur collection. Some well needed Refurbs and upgrades seem to be in motion which is good to see.,Dinosaurs and Gems.... what else do you want?
"April 21, 2016",Very well done museum. Easy to navigate. Color coded areas. Lot of good food choices. Dinosaurs and Gems.... what else do you want?,One of the best fossil collections in the world
"April 19, 2016",The fossils are the highlight. Also the building itself is amazing and wreaks of history! A must on your London itinerary,It's all about the dinosaurs....
"April 18, 2016",This was my second visit to the museum and once again I loved the dinosaur exhibit. It had so many things to look at. Loved the animatronic t-rex,Good for kids
"April 18, 2016",I took my son to see the dinosaur skeleton. They had a stegosaurus n another veggie eating dinosaur which was the biggest so far from their collection. Its a must go I think.,Still the best museum in the world
"April 3, 2016",I remember visiting this museum as a kid many years ago and memories came flooding back when I took my son there last year. This is an amazing museum. It's huge. The atmosphere is great and there are always different exhibitions that children love. If you happen to be in London and want to take your kids on a really fulfilling trip then head to the natural history museum. Good museum shop for souvenirs and a cafe available so you can enjoy your lunch without leaving the premises. Strongly recommended. ,Wow!
"March 29, 2016","Of all the times I've been to London, this was my very first visit to the Natural History Museum. My husband and I decided that this was one of the must-see places during our Christmas trip to London with our children because our daughter in particular loves science, dinosaurs, etc. The museum is located in South Kensington, getting there was really convenient. Two tube stops away to the South Kensington tube stop and underground walkway that basically led you to the entrance of the museum. We visited on Boxing Day (December 26) and made the mistake of arriving about 10:30 a.m. or so. There was already a long line to get into the museum, it moved rather quickly so it wasn't too bad but once you were inside, it was crazy crowded. The building itself is impressive as many buildings in London and the inside will leave you in awe as well. Exhibits were located in different sections which made it a lot less confusing. I think the highlight of our visit was going to the Dinosaur area...the huge brontosaurus (at least I hope it was a brontosaurus) skeleton was a fantastic way to start of the tour, the lines were long once again as it seemed like everyone in London was there but it kept moving and allowed us to take a ton of pictures of the kids in front of the skeleton. From there, you went into an area which housed all the dino exhibits, our kids absolutely loved that, you couldn't touch anything but just being able to see everything dinosaur related was a treat to them. We spent a total of 4 hours there but didn't get to see all the exhibits because of the number of people visiting that day that we were there. I would say on a non holiday visit, maybe 4 hours would have suffice, going on Boxing Day should have been a hint to us that we needed to allocated at least 6 hours to see all that this museum has to offer. Maybe the next time we're back in London, we'll stop by again but it definitely is a must see and best of all, it's FREE,  which in a place like London is very much appreciated!",Really nice natural history museum
"March 28, 2016",This was my ten year old sons very favorite place we visited.  The line was very long.  Be sure to go early in the day.  We waited one hour to get into the museum and all the exhibits were very crowded.  ,"If the NHM were a clothing item, it would be a pair of comfortable old slippers."
"March 28, 2016","It's a while since I last visited the NHM and they have made significant investments in new exhibits and building extensions in that time. This is the first time we have visited as a family, with kids in the 6-12 yr old range and so it was interesting to see what they made of it.Many of the exhibits are as I remember them, but I was blown away by the quality of the Earth Hall and Geology exhibits as well as the Darwin Centre. The latter provides an overview of what it is to be a researcher and takes you through research methods and the lighter side of the peer-review process. It's very informative and well worth taking the time to understand properly, but as others note, it would be nice to have some friendly faces to talk town real life, rather than digitize the whole thing.Parts of the museum are showing their age. It's a little dogeared and scruffy in places, with some of the exhibits in need of serious refresh or replacement to bring them up to date, but more importantly, it's free.Packed and crazy with roving herds of diminutive school kids, it's exactly what you'd expect from a national museum. Don't expect peace and quiet, aside from outside in the Wildlife Garden. Don't forget to take in the majesty of Waterhouse's architecture when you get a chance.",Great!!!
"March 23, 2016",There are lots of sign around so you don't get lost and workers there to help you and talk to you about the exhibit. A fantastic place to go and very fascinating I had a great time. I have been twice and both times I have learnt something new. It's not only education but very fun!,For adults and kids
"March 23, 2016",Really enjoyed visiting the museum. A lot to see. I think it would be good to have a tour guide bring you along but it is easy to find your way around. I think definitely do it if you can. ,"Science fans, beware! :)"
"March 21, 2016",Wow!! This museum is simply amazing! As soon as you enter the door you can tell you are about to spend a good time deep in the science world! From fossils to Darwin's evolution of the species..you can easily spend most of your day inside this museum and have loads of fun & learning time. All of this is free but you can help by giving some money for the museum's maintenance. There are restaurants inside so you don't need to worry about going out and back again in the waiting line.,"Fun, Full day for Free"
"March 19, 2016","A full day can be lost in the museum as it is filled full of wonder. As a family the children who were all young, enjoyed every aspect. The attraction is free and provides fun for all the family. We went in the holidays and it was extremely busy so get there early otherwise expect a queue.",A must
"March 18, 2016","Excellent place to spend a couple of hours away from the cold, the fossils are awesome my four year old son was trill, also the mammals exhibition is awesome they have a big wheal hanging!!   ",Where is Trex?
"March 18, 2016","Was here with my 4 year old. We were in Science Museum first, and good thing that the museum closes later (at 5:45 p.m.). We went straight to the dinosaurs, and my son really enjoyed it. Last time we were here, some years ago, my husband and I remembered that there was a complete T-Rex. But we did not find it during our trip. The TREX we found this time, was a TREX moving model (and my little boy got a little scared).We also love the museum shop :)You need to buy the museum maps at 1 GBP. But at least there is no recommended donations.",Another massive museum. Spend a day here.
"April 18, 2016",Great museum that has alot going for it. Make sure you visit the vault at the top floor to see some of the most rare and beautiful precious stones in the world. You come out of here with a massive appreciation for the natural world and this place is so big you could probably spend a week going about it and still not see everything.  Brilliant for large groups as well as the entrance is free. Just make sure you have some way of identifying them in the large crowds.  Well worth a visit.,First visit
"April 17, 2016",Excellently laid out exhibitions with activities. This is a place for the whole family as there is something for all ages. Learnt things about dinosaurs I never knew before.,The Place To Go - Anytime Any Age
"April 17, 2016",Went to the Natural History Museum yesterday and came in particular to see the dinosaur exhibition and we were not disappointed! Absolutely amazing! The building and architecture are an added bonus. Breathtaking and a piece of art in its own right. Went to the mammal section too. It was good and educational but maintenance of the area appeared pretty poor.,Quick trip but excellent destination
"April 17, 2016",The NHM is great for adults or children. I am a biologist and couldn't pass up a visit. The main Hall is beautiful in itself and the displays are breath taking. ,Very interesting and informative
"April 17, 2016","The Natural History Museum's collections were built over centuries so there is a lot to see, give yourself several hours for a visit. This is a good activity for older children too. This is one of my favorite museums in the world, and I visit nearly every time I come to London.",Rainy day exploration
"April 16, 2016",This beautiful building houses an enormous amount of historical items.  You could wander around all day in there and not see everything.  Pick 2 sections and really immerse yourself in the time periods to get the full effect.,"So much to see and do, for free!"
"April 16, 2016","The Natural History Museum is in a beautiful building housing many taxidermy and model animals, exhibits, a dinosaur section and so much more.  You can spend hours exploring and learning here.  It is free so be prepared, there will probably be a queue.",Very exciting and nice museum.  Worth a visit if you have kids but great for adults too.
"April 15, 2016","We went when it was a bank holiday and the lines at the entrance were long.  However, worth every second of that wait.  Amazing exhibits and very helpful and friendly staff inside if you happen to get lost :)  Beautiful architecture too !",Going the Darwin route
"April 15, 2016","There is so many positives from this visit, I don't even know where to start.I was there for watching two photo exhibitions, but ended up being in the dino section.The queues are endless, meaning you should be there before 11.00.I bought a ticket in a booth not far away from the adjacent tube station. This meant I could walk past the endless queue, and enter the museum with no fuss whatsoever.Great experience. Will definately be back.",A nice place!
"April 14, 2016","I really liked this museum, mainly because of the dinosaurs, but they had alot of other cool stuff there too, alot of whales and underwater animals showed in their real size which was pretty impressive, and alot of rocks too. The only minus was the queues, but i mean.. Thats what you have to expect on these places",Fantastic museum!
"December 28, 2015","Absolutely enthralling museum, with a splendid exhibition displaying just about everything in natural history, and done so in versatile and interesting ways. We spent well over 3hrs in this museum and time just flew by. Everything felt modern, thought-through and wellmade. The building is which houses the museum is stunning aswell. A hallmark for museums everywhere and well worth a visit for anyone coming to London either couples, familys or single travelers. The museum is closely located to the tube and easily reached, admission is free (at least it was at the time of our visit) and nice and affordable food options were avaliable inside aswell!",Great museum
"December 27, 2015",This museum still brings childhood memories to me and I love every time I go there. It always fascinates me. The facilities are great and the collection of artefacts is brilliant. ,So big
"December 25, 2015","Best Musuem ever,!!!! This Musuem is good if you have time to spend cos it is so big not bigger than the American one though.",Science church
"December 23, 2015","Every visit to this monument to natural history is worthwhile. The building itself is magnificent, the displays are world class. ",Massive dinosaurs display
"December 20, 2015","We stopped by Natural History Museum on our way to Portobello Market on a Friday, and it was already crowded with the young and old alike. We saw children in school uniform around, probably on a learning journey to the museum. We liked that it was near the tube, admission was free (yay for budget travellers who want to see as much as possible of London), free wifi (double YAY), and there was SO MUCH TO SEE for a free admission. We zoomed in for the dinosaurs exhibit, but stopped along other sections like marine biology and human biology. Took us about 2 hours. We left feeling happy and dropped some cash into the donation box as we felt we learnt something during the visit.",Fabulous from start to finish! 
"December 20, 2015",After visiting it's New York City sister building this trip was a long time in coming. It definitely didn't disappoint. 7 hours of fascinating artefacts and sights to engage any body regardless of interest or intellect! Can't wait to come back to see future exhibitions!!  ,What a great way to spend a day
"December 16, 2015","Had such a wonderful time in this museum. Free entry, hooray! The dinosaurs are so cool and all of the exhibits are wonderfully laid out. A great place to get lost in on a rainy day. ",Tremendous day out
"December 13, 2015","We went as a family with kids aged 11, 9 and 7.  They all really enjoyed the whole experience.  Lots to see and do and lots of interactive displays.The cafes are a bit pricey, but good quality produce.Top day out and would highly recommend.",Free for everyone! 
"December 12, 2015",Lived this experience.  To see Van Gogh and Renoir simply hanging right there in front of me was spectacular. ,Best museum in London 
"December 9, 2015",A great place for all ages to visit. The dinosaur skeletons are impressive. They have a huge array of precious materials. I couldn't recommend highly enough.   ,really good and educating
"November 16, 2015","I really enjoyed walking round and seeing the different types of animals, dinosaurs, the way of life and nature. however I must say that when it got to getting in to the museum we had to que for half an hour because we had to have bag searches, which I didn't mind but It was raining and cold! also the food was very very expensive it was £5.00 for a ham and cheese baguette my partner had to go without having food because he didn't want to pay that when you could get the same from another shop! all in all the museum was really good and I would go back!",Best museum ever visited!
"November 7, 2015","This museum has everything if you are interested in biology and science in general. They are currently working on the skeleton of a blue whale, can't wait to see that once finished. ",Too big? Best for dinosaurs lovers.
"November 3, 2015","This is first of all a great and beautiful building, inside and out.It has so many interesting things to see that you can easily spend a hole day there! And this can be a problem when you're in this amazing city that is London. It's mostly about minerals and animals: the Human specie, other living creatures and of course the Dinosaurs. It's free and has a lot of interesting things for kids.",Go when (if ever) you can avoid the crowds ...
"November 2, 2015","Having just arrived in England after a long stretch in France and having no idea that the English kids were on school holidays I ambled off to the Natural History Museum mainly because I was staying nearby for some days.The queues to get in from the start of the day were stupendous!  It was the dawning of the knowledge that it was school holiday time. Enthusiastic kids of all ages, including quite young ones,  had arrived with parents in tow (I think that is the right way to put it) and I was aghast at first at the idea of queuing and then milling inside with so many little ones.However it was quite an eye-opening experience on a number of points:  firstly the 'crowd-control' security staff had the whole process well in-hand.  We were informed of progress, staff kept kids amused, the English parents and littlies as well as older children showed remarkable patience and perseverance and lost none of their enthusiasm at all.Secondly, I was astonished at the sheer excitement of and interest of all the kids, from really quite young children to high-school aged ones too.  It was an experience in itself to watch the utter delight of parents and kids together, especially in the Dinosaurs sections.The Museum itself was worth the queuing for me as it was a most interesting, surprising and extensive display on many themes and areas of research and learning.Do not miss the Room of Treasures!  Allow a full day - you can get a reasonable meal there!",A fun way to spend a few hours
"November 2, 2015",I made the mistake of visiting the museum on a wet day in the last week of the summer holidays. The line to get in was long. It took approximately 45 minutes to get in.I enjoyed the museum. I did cut my time short because of the kids. It was too busy for me to relax and fully enjoy it.,awesome
"October 30, 2015",AWESOME....and free....is huge ..nice ... impossible to get bored. i advice everyone  if possible to visit during the week time  and  avoid weekends  as is crazy busy ....i was impressed  and i am not the type of person who enjoy museums in general ... but this one love it .. spend about 3 hrs inside  and was a general visit . if u pay attention to everything will be like 5 hr visit i think,"Fun, educational, and free!"
"October 28, 2015","This is an absolute must visit! I've been with many friends and family who have visited (ages between 19-50 somethings - but would be a great outing with children as well), all of whom have given it rave reviews. The museum is well laid out with a range of exhibits. However, it can get quite busy on weekends so if possible, I suggest going during the week days. The museum is directly in front of the South Kensington tube station so very easy access and is next door to the Science museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum so you can make a day of it, if you like. There is also plenty of outdoor space if you want to have your lunch outside.","Educational, fun & well put together"
"October 27, 2015","This is a delight for anyone with a passion for finding out about our beginnings. We very happily spent nearly an entire day pottering around and only left when we did because we needed to catch the train home!It's busy & popular because the UK has this wonderful concept of making museums free to enter thus ensuring that everyone has equal access. There were plenty of kids in there having a great time (except one who was terrified of the dinosaurs) and they were learning at the same time - brilliant! The museum has bins for donations, and if you visit, please do consider donating to enable them to keep doing what they do so wonderfully. We all benefit from them.",Dinosaur Hunting
"October 27, 2015",Took our 4.5 year old little boy on his first trip to London to see Dippy and he wasn't disappointed. The museum is as fantastic as I remembered it we only saw a small part of it as its a long day for a 4 year old and there is a lot of walking involved. the exhibits were great. we will be coming back you need to leave a good 1.5hrs just to do the dinosaurs. be prepared to queue to get in at busy times but it's well worth it just to see the look of amazement on your child's face when the first see dippy the diplodocus in the entrance. A must do with your kids,A must
"October 26, 2015",A fabulous building with exhibits that could have kept me there for days!! The geological section alone took over half my allocated time. Just so much to see & children will love the dinosaur sections. A further visit will be necessary....,Very interesting!
"December 8, 2015",Very interesting in a historical building. You would think you are in a church rather than a museum. Lots and lots of interesting things to see. I really don't know how they can do this for FREE! We spent half a day there and barely seeing everything in details!,A must-see!!
"December 6, 2015","WOW! What a beautiful building and what a fantastic way to spend the day. We spent 6 hours with our daughters (ages 4 and 7) and not once did they utter the words ""I'm bored."" The dinosaur exhibit was the favorite. ",Fascinating and Free
"December 5, 2015",Do yourself a favour and visit - great for all ages!  Would be a treat to visit during their Christmas skating festival.,Lots to see.
"December 1, 2015",Free museum. Just ask for donation of fiver. Spent 4 hours there very interesting. Suitable for all ages.,Another Great Spot on your Visit.
"November 29, 2015","These is a huge place, so do some research prior to your visit so you can better view the exhibit rooms. Don't miss clock room - it is fascinating.",A must see
"November 29, 2015",An excellent museum with education and entertaining for every age group.  It is a huge museum and FREE to get in.  Truly a gem of London.  ,Awesome museum
"November 28, 2015","Simply awesome, just go. The bone collections will more than makeup for the boring stuff to kids. The stones and gems and simulated earthquake were great too! Owh, and there are fossils too!",Perfect with 11 year old son !!!
"November 23, 2015","Great measum...you would never get around all of it so here's a tip..before you go, list the ten things you want to see there...takes a little research by the kids, but unless you know what you want to see it can be a little daunting...our favorites were the dinosaurs, the earthquakes and volcanoes, ..the marines section with blue whale (amazing but dusty!!!)..also and oddly the human biology section....which if you haven't explained the facts of life to your children ..is a good place to start !!!!",Magical night of Ice Skating!
"November 17, 2015",We had gone to the BNHM for Ice Skating on Monday night. The place was beautfully lit up and looked like a place out of a fairytale. Highly recommended!!,Attended a wedding as a venue
"November 17, 2015",If you are looking to organise a function in this museum unfortunately the rooms does not lend itself to a reception. The room to the side of the main entrance is long and narrow. If you are 600 people you get stuck at the end will miss out on food and drinks. Once you move to the main hall once again where the bar stations and food stations are placed. It is not practical and gets very busy when serving.  With the dance floor large bar and occasional tables it is not possible move around freely. It is disappointing,Natural History Museum is a must visit!
"October 12, 2015","It is so well laid out with the names of the animals, minerals etc, that one learns a lot.  A great place to go with children. It holds their attention and is cultural at the same time.",I love this museum
"October 11, 2015",Full of interesting and varied displays with the opportunity to interact with some of them.  Imaginatively presented - apart from the room full of rocks.  The Human Body area is especially fascinating.  And entry is free!,Dull
"October 11, 2015",Dull and not much to see. Very dated in there and poorly laid out. Smellie and toilets were disgusting!! ,Amazing architecture!
"October 9, 2015","The collections are great, but for me the real treasure is the building itself. The main hall is gorgeous with open stairs carved with a variety of animals and plants, a statute of Charles Darwin, and the ceiling panels are painted with different plants. I could spend hours just exploring the architecture. But, we did look at some other things and saw dinosaurs, a huge blue whale, and a free talk on arthropods.  The Natural History Museum also has an ourdoor garden. It's a bit late in the season, but it was still a nice little walk in the middle of the city and a chance to get outside before heading back in for more Science!",Good place to go after the V&A
"October 8, 2015","The building is beautiful, but the exhibits need updating. I made sure to donate to help improve here. We loved the animatronic dinosaurs and the earthquake simulator though. A bit disappointed that half of the bird gallery was removed on our visit. Well, that maybe for the best. Also liked the fact that they are letting their stuffed animals fade and the explanation. They no longer want to kill animals just to put them stuffed on display.  I actually got vertigo on the escalator up to the earth displays. That was kinda fun (and funny!).",Always great
"September 30, 2015",I always go to the wildlife photo of the year exhibition which is always very inspiring/off putting. The build is always worth looking at and the exhibits always interesting. ,visit to national history museum
"September 28, 2015","Really interesting .including the life size dinosaur reconstruction.Both impressive and informative,.Excellent wheelchair access,No charge but you can leave a voluntary contribution.","Fantastic building, helpful staff, clean toilets, great exhibitions"
"September 24, 2015","We visited on a Sunday and queued outside for about 20 minutes. The queue was civilised and fast moving when the museum opened. The staff handled the crowed really well. As we got closer to the door a young staff member greeted the crowd and promoted a tour book for £5 which we bought. Quick bag search as you go in. Amazing first impressions, the architecture is incredible and the first thing you see if a giant dinosaur skeleton. Was advised by staff to do the dinosaur (blue zone) zone first due to it getting busier later. Great exhibitions. We were limited on time so also quickly saw the earth section, volcanoes, earthquakes, human biology section and briefly saw the aquatic section - shame that the whales and other aquatic mammals section was closed.Clean toilets, helpful staff, easy to read map and a fantastic day out!",a must see!
"September 20, 2015","We weren't planning on coming here but thought why not as we had a bit of time to kill! Amazing amazing museum! Its fun and very interesting, would be great for people of all ages but two in the 20s loved it! Great exhibitions and so much to see, we wish we allowed more time.",A dream
"September 17, 2015","Absolutely a amazing plaze. Join the fantastic dinosaur creatures, exibitions and the building it self. Its free and lots of exibitions, one word: fantatsic",Disappointing
"July 14, 2015",I've always wanted to go here but I left disappointed. The museum itself is a magnificent building and we didn't have to queue long to get in. Unfortunately inside it is uncomfortably warm and extremely busy so it was impossible to get close to many exhibits. I was looking forward to seeing the original dinosaur fossils but many were just plaster casts. The exhibits are predominantly aimed at children which of course is great for the kids but not so much the adults. For the size of the building I expected to see a lot more items on display. There were extra displays you could pay to see - we didn't mainly because of the heat and it seemed unlikely they'd be any better.,The best museum for kids
"July 14, 2015","You can't get bored of this museum, especially of you have kids, the location is surrounded with museums and all of them got something special to see, defiantly a must for all London visitors.",Amazing pizza!
"July 13, 2015","Whilst on a visit to the Natural History Museum we realised we hadn't stopped for lunch so decided to grab a pizza to share from the restaurant with a couple of drinks. The pizza was made to order and tasted delicious, definitely a good choice. Don't hesitate to eat here! We were very impressed. ",This musem will blow your mind!
"July 12, 2015","Museum has very easy access through the tube which when you leave you can see the breathtaking outside view of the building. It has an enormous amount of exhibitions and even if you are small or big, you will find this place fascinating!- Plan a day or maybe two days visit, you may see all the exhibitions in approx. 4-5 hours but by walking really quick- Take a small map with you at the entrance, it will be helpfull- Get informed a day before for anything special going on from the musem's website, you might find it interesting- Try keeping track of where you've been and not as you might miss something- Since this is one the most famous museum's of London, arm yourself with patience, you will see a lot of people and maybe wait a lot as well in the lines- Very reliable and free Wi-Fi- Before you leave don't forget to visit the museum's store, very nice items",The BEST
"July 10, 2015",Went there with my sister and spent the whole day there! it has everything you want and is divided into sections so you get to choose your particular interest. Believe me each section is worth a visit. Loved everything about that museum. will be going there again for sure. BTW no entry fee for the museum!!,"Wonderful place, never long enough to see it."
"July 6, 2015","Went specifically to see the Coral Reefs exhibition which was excellent. Very informative and lots of visual guides. Great tank of live coral and fish. Food video about the reefs problems due to climate change and fishing, and pollution.","Dinosaurs, fleas and rocks"
"July 2, 2015","This was my 10 year old sons big treat - dinosaurs, lunch, the darwin centre (which is fabulous) and the wildlife garden complete with wild bees, rocks and minerals (a room missed by most, also quiet and relaxing) and apart from the food and drink it was free.Top tips: get there early, out of holiday season, from victoria station by tube not bus (takes ages) and get a taxi back when you are worn out. Also check your bags into the luggage dept. so you can relax. Eat at the darwin centre (less noise and queuing).","Its free, whats there to complain about?"
"July 2, 2015",I've been here numerous times and it never ceases to be interesting. Some of the exhibits are getting a little dated (the insects and creepy crawlies) but overall as it is free you can't really complain.If you need the toilet don't use the one right by the entrance there are plenty inside which aren't as busy!,Crowded
"July 1, 2015",Went with my family and it was packed. Staff were directing crowds - not that there was anywhere to go. People were crammed into small exhibition rooms and were unable to move forward or backwards as a result of the staff directing more people into the area. Really disappointed in what should have been a great day out.,So much to see
"June 29, 2015",The museum seemed huge to me.  Almost endless rooms of interesting collections.  What amazed me though was the beauty of the building itself.  That even if the museum was emptied of all their artifacts it would still be worth visiting for the detailed architecture.,Very Interesting!
"June 28, 2015","You could spend a couple of days here to see everything. We only had a few hours so we saw the dinosaurs and the rocks and fossil areas.Go early because the dinosaur area gets crowded since the new Jurassic World movie is out. My favorite part was the diamonds and colored gems,",Perfect for learning
"June 26, 2015","It is my opinion that everybody should visit this museum, a lot of things can be learnt and of course, it is also fun to be in. They don't charge a fee (like other museums, which is nice) and it is amazing! Do not miss out! ","Filled with gems, literally"
"June 26, 2015","The National History Museum is divided into four Zones - Blue, Red, Green and Orange - and here are my personal recommendations from each Zone:1) Blue Zone - Dinosaurs2) Red Zone - Earth Lab, Earth's Treasury, Volcanoes and Earthquakes3) Green Zone - Hintze Hall, The Vault4) Orange Zone - Wildlife GardenIt should take at least an hour to explore each Zone, and two to properly go through each of them. If you don't want to spend too much time checking out this interactive museum, three hours should be enough. Just make sure you don't miss The Vault.Admission is free. There are a good number of bathroom facilities, and cafes are available. Souvenirs are not too pricey. What can I say? It has a well-rounded collection, plenty of facilities ...... the Natural History Museum may not be colossal like the British Museum, but it certainly is special in its own right.",Couldn't Ask for More
"June 24, 2015","I am not a big fan of museum tours. but, I absolutely like this one here with a wide range of things to see. but the aquarium where they charge you for entrance is not worth coz there's basically nothing to see",Dinosaurs
"June 22, 2015",giving a high rating only and only for the massive collection of dinosaurus relics. Can be a fun place for kids . but if you are a grown up just visit the Dinosaurus zone and get out.  ,So MUCH to see :)
"June 18, 2015","A must visit London attraction for kids and adults. This museum is a great way to spend about 3-4 hours while you are in London. About 80% exhibits were really interesting and mind-blowing (especially the dinosaurs, human and mammal part).",Probably the best in the World
"June 18, 2015","Located in a very centrally located London area and in the most unusual building London has to offer, this incredible Museum is entirely free and open to anyone. It has everything you would expect for a world class Museum and a gigantic and grandiose size grouping so many species of animals, insects, minerals, etc. The Dinosaur skeleton in the lobby is just mind boggling. Outstanding place to visit for all ages.",Enjoyable for both parents and kids
"June 14, 2015","We had some time to kill prior to leaving for the airport, and made a visit to the Natural History Museum. They have a well above average collection of animals and other items in their exhibitions. We espacially enjoyed the dinosaur and earth history exhibitions. The museum is good for both a quick walkthrough and a more thorough walk to learn a lot of details. If you want to avoid too many people and school classes, you should visit early. Will definately recommend.",Great for kids and adults alike
"June 12, 2015",Entering the museum and seeing the large dinosaur starts the exciting adventure.  The museum is full of interesting rooms and can be done in an a couple of hours or stay all day.  Plenty to keep kids from getting bored.,Nice place to see of you have some extra time
"June 11, 2015","The building that houses the museum is breathtaking. The Giant sequoia, the earth exhibits are fascinating. The minerals section is very detailed and vast. If it gets too much for you, head to the back of the minerals section to a smaller exhibit which features gemstones and even a cursed amethyst. ",Enjoyable for both parents and kids

"June 9, 2015","Impressive, informative, exciting and fun. Such an enjoyable time spent in this beautiful building, my daughter,  7yr old grandson and myself had a wonderful time here. The exhibits are so impressive and everythinfs laid out in such a way you really are learning all the time. Taking an escalator through the centre of the earth, standing in a shop and experiencing an earthquake and being roared at by a dinosaur are just some of the memories that will stay with me always.....and all free.....fabulous a must for all the family, pkease go.",Dont take away the Dinosaur!!!!
"June 8, 2015","Visited recently with my dinosaur loving kids, will be terrible if they take away the main dinosaur exhibit to replace it with a whale.Great stuff to see, for kids and adults alike, exhibits changing all the time, so can visit often.",Great and free museum!
"June 8, 2015","We went to this museum twice as we did not have enough time first time around to see everything it has to offer. It's a great place for kids of all ages as well as for adults. Lots of different exhibits! Free entrance, however, some exhibitions could be for a fee. It can get very crowdy as well as schools tend to bring students there for day trips. For that reason I would recommend going there in the afternoon towards the end of the day, but be aware that they are open until 5.50 pm and you probably going to need at least 2 hours to get through most things.",One of the best Natural History museums in the world 
"June 7, 2015","It has an impressive collection of skeletons, reproductions and stuffed animals, including one of the most impressive dinosaur collections in the world. The dinosaur in the main hall alone is worth the visit (which is free). ",Should be on your Bucketlist
"June 5, 2015","An absolute must visit. If you went to the UK and only been to that museum, it would have made your trip worthwhile.Free entrance, cafe and restaurant available at the location, takes half a day to tour it.",The walls are alive with the sound of living!
"June 4, 2015","This remarkable building is a testament to the brilliance and vision of the best of Victorian adventure and architecture ! With free admission it has to be one of the best experiences in London for you and your family. Crammed with an incredibly diverse collection it juxtaposes its complex terracotta tiles entwining stone lizards and birds with life size dinasours and state of the art digital displays. As an institution it has come a long way academically , abandoning its 19th century reputation of being a place dominated by appointments made by gentlemanly favouri it now sparks thinking , investigation and occasionally fear! Just check the 5 year old encountering the 32m long Diplodocus Carnegie skeleton for the first time or the Anti-evolutionist coming across the marble Statue of  Darwin in the corridor! With regularly changing exhibitions this great institution never loses its sparkle and synthesises a certain kind of spirit and endeavour that apparently we never lost. No excuses- visitor or Londoner- get down there with the fam !",Natural history lives in London
"June 4, 2015","Natural History museum of London is one of the most important museums of science and research worldwide. It includes collections of botanics, enthomology, paleontology, mineralogy and zoology.Tube stop: South KensingtonOpening time: daily 10.00-17.50FREE entry.",One not too miss in London
"September 11, 2015",Great for the kids.  The dinosaur section has been really well done and is informative for the whole family.  Definitely one for the littlies to visit.  Some stunning treasures on display and worth a visit.  ,"Beautiful building, great exhibits and expensive food"
"September 7, 2015","As an attraction that is free, this is one of the best things to do on your visit to London! That being said, there are some individual exhibits such as the David Attenborough experience and a Coral exhibit amongst others, that are paid (around about a fiver and well worth it). However these aren't essential as the regular exhibits are fascinating and will keep you going all day! The dinosaur walkthrough was a favourite of ours. A piece of advice - take a packed lunch!! Particularly for families as the food available was limited and overpriced. Other than that, one of the best (and cheapest!!) things to do in London! ","free, must go, be there early"
"September 6, 2015",+once inside pls queue for the most popular exhibition first before the crowd comes in+very large inside and can easily spend half a day here,wonderful for all ages
"September 4, 2015",Amazing exhibitions in a wonderful environment and beautiful buildings. We always love to visit and learn something every time. This time it was mainly the 'Red Zone' but with required return to dinosaurs and the Butterfly exhibition - worth the entrance fee.,Crowds and crowds!
"September 3, 2015","After multiple visits to London, I finally made my way to this museum. I came towards the end of the day during the week and it was PACKED. Still, there is no entry fee and the museum is relatively good (I'm not a huge museum person to begin with). The building itself is also very pretty. I waited in line for about an hour to see the dinosaur exhibit, which I felt was okay for adults but probably way cooler for kids (if they can tolerate the long wait in the very hot room). This place isn't on my list of London favorites, but it's worth a look.","2 hours queue for dinosaurs exhibition. With kids: either that, or the rest of the museum."
"September 3, 2015","The exhibition is very interesting, though most of the exhibits are replicas and not the real thing… There are a few fossils that are really amazing! The thing is, that after queuing for so long,  especially with children, they don't have patience to see the rest of the very interesting exhibitions. The museum is huge! Bottom line : if you go there, its either the dinosaurs exhibition,  or the rest of the museum. ",Went there every time I could ...
"September 1, 2015","Every time I ever took my children to London we went here, it is just brilliant! We would go late afternoon (I think because it was free after 4pm), it's a 'must do' in London ...","A ""must"" when visiting London"
"August 31, 2015","Enjoyed our few hours in the museum. Was good that there wasn't pressure on entry to make a donation (as had been the case in the Science Museum), we did chose to make a donation which felt more rewarding because of the lack of pressure. Lots to see and well laid out. Down points would be the dinosaur display - queued for ages with 2 small children and the heat in the room itself was incredibly unpleasant. When my children wanted to leave as they were so hot I was worried about them, there was no easy way out, had to walk through all of the remainder of the exhibition through the queues to ""escape"". This should be better organised, I don't normally feel claustrophobic but the amount of people coupled with the heat (it wasn't a hot day) made me very uncomfortable. Also the cost of the food in the cafe was extortionate - 3 small children's ham rolls, 1 cheese sandwich, 2 cans of coke, 2 small caramel shortcakes and 2 small cookies - £24 !! Very very overpriced - a slice of cake was £4.20, can of coke £1.95 etc. I know they are self-funded but having already made a reasonable donation on entry, I felt rather ripped off. So be warned - do not choose to eat here.",Fun for families
"August 26, 2015","This museum is perfect for families with small children (actually children of all ages will love it) especially the dinosaur exhibition. The dinosaur exhibition is so much fun, but ALWAYS has huge queues; go when the museum first opens of don't bother.Also there are lots of constructions going on at the moment which makes the museum a bit less pretty than usual, and some of the littler exhibitions are closed, but it's still a great museum.",Entertaining and Informative
"August 25, 2015",I have never before had to queue to get into a museum but a half hour wait was well worth it for this attraction.Apart from the fact that it is a beautiful building on its own the exhibits are excellent to. Many different areas and thousands of exhibits. Good for adults and children.,Impressive
"February 25, 2015","Mind that many museums in London are free, so is the Natural History Museum. It is worth the visit & you will need 3-4 hours just to browse the different collections. The main Hall is amazing, an architectural gem.",You need to plan your trip!
"February 23, 2015","We visited on a rainy day in half term and arrived 10 minutes before it opened at 10am.Very easy to access from South Kensington and the staff were already directing visitors when we got there. We were pretty much straight in and had already decided to go straight to the Dino exhibit first which had no queue and was fascinating. Sooooo glad we did because the queue became ridiculous very quickly. After that we went to the volcanoes and earthquake area, sea creatures and to see the blue whale. We also had lunch in one of the cafes and spent some time (and money!) in the gift shop.In the end we were there about 4 hours which, considering we had a 7 and 4 yr old with us, was enough. As we left I think I can safely say that I haven't seen as many people crammed into a museum before. It was mental with a queue under umbrellas waiting outside. Would certainly come back and arrive at opening again to avoid the main crowds. ",Too busy but a good free day out just don't go on a school holiday.
"February 22, 2015","The line to get in was huge, seriously huge so we decided to come back later. No better at 3pm. Once in it was busy & with two children it became hard work. The downer was that we had been to the New York natural history museum & we're kind of comparing it to that meaning we kept thinking it wasn't as good.",half term visit
"February 18, 2015",Queing system in place. 40 minutes to get in ( at least it wasn't raining)! Staff selling books for £5 in queue - at least kept kids happy whilst waiting. Expensive charges for cloakroom - £2 for each of our coats. Very crowded in each section of museum. and staff moving you on in the dinosaur section (having to queue  for another 30 minutes) which was a pain as you need as much time as it takes to dwell on the exhibits and for children to ask questions/take photos etc. Shortage of places to eat and drink due to volume of people - would recommend taking own food and finding a spot on the floor to eat - more eating areas would be welcome.All staff very approachable and willing to help. Volunteers at museum very informative and engaged the childrenWide range of exhibits to interest everyone if only we could get close to them !Would definitely visit again but never in the half term!,Too crowded!
"February 15, 2015","Visited with a school party and found the whole visit VERY disappointing.Although this is a fabulous museum, and is well worth a visit, I found that the sheer number of people that had been allowed in during our visit was, quite ludicrous!There was no way to view the exhibits properly. The dinosaur exhibition was so crowded, we couldn't even gain entry. The noise level was such that it was impossible to talk to our group to discuss what we were seeing.That said, there are really good facilities for eating, toilets and gift shops.It just is such a pity that our visit was made so uncomfortable, but the volume of people.","Naturally, we had to visit"
"February 14, 2015","This has been on my 'to visit' list for some time. It was a Saturday afternoon and I only had to queue outside for around 10 minutes. Once inside I dropped my coat at the cloak-room and picked up a map.It's a pretty big museum with lots of good exhibits but some feel a little dated; still you can't complain as it is free! This does mean it's very busy though, the queue for the Dinosaur exhibition was huge.I particularly enjoyed the 'Treasures Cadogan Gallery' where the special exhibits are all displayed together, such as a piece of our moon. Doing this museum in an afternoon meant that I fell just short of time to do everything, I had to skip the Geology hall.",Dino Snore Sleep over
"March 16, 2015","This is just the best experience in a museum! It is very well organised, and there is plenty to keep you occupied. We have visited this Museum a few times in the past and always enjoyed it, but to see it when the doors are locked, and to sleep under the Diplodocus tail is something else!  I cant begin to tell you how much fun this was, and well worth every penny.  If you are thinking about signing up for this, it is exactly how they describe it, and would love other people to have as much fun as we did.  The treasure hunt in the pitch dark dinosaur room was great by torchlight.",You could spend a day here
"March 15, 2015",What an amazing place. We only managed to see one whole section in a few hours. The building itself is incredible and there is a variety of exhibitions. The weekends are much busier than during the week so if you wish to move around freely then first thing on a weekday would be the ideal time to visit.,A must visit during London stay
"March 14, 2015","I visited the museum for second time. I must say that its a must visit if you are in London. I think its the best natural history museum of the world. It fascinates adults but kids, too. Beware that the weekends may be overcrowded. The admission is free to anyone.",recommendation
"March 14, 2015","Beautiful place to visit.The only thing we struggled with was the very long waiting to enter in the front, but we managed to get in around the corner, no cue there :-)museum is divided in different parts and we enjoyed the lot of themcertainly a visit worth",Wow!
"March 9, 2015",Free entrance just temping you to come over here. You need around 2 hours to see everything. A lot of interactive places so you time flow so quickly and in neighbourhood you have science museum so 2in1 ;) perfect place to museums lovers!,May need more than one day
"March 6, 2015","This museum is HUGE...the displays are broken up into sections. Be prepared for a lot of walking and if you want to see everything, plan on a full day, at least. The building itself is beautiful and the displays are certainly worth seeing.",Good museum especially for families
"March 5, 2015",The Natural History Museum in Kensington is one of the best family oriented museums in London. The lines for the dinosaur exhibits testify to this as well. On this visit I explored the second and third floors which was fascinating. The treasures room is on the second floor and contains many rare pieces from the permanent collections. I was fascinated by Scott's Penguin eggs from Antarctica and the experiment that was performed on them.  There were also pages from Audobon's folios. The birds are exquisitely executed.  The mineral vault is overwhelming and it was impossible to see all of it in a few hours.The third floor contains a cross section from a giant Sequoia tree.  Another visit is needed to go through more on these floors.,Fantastic visit
"March 1, 2015","Right, the key to visiting the museum is to get there early. Being our dinosaur obsessed sons birthday we decided to visit and arrived at 0930 on a Sat morning. About 20 people in front of us in the queue but when doors opened we were first into the dinosaur exhibit. Result. We spent an hour wandering around taking it all in before we visited the dinosaur shop. A quick coffee and we were set to tackle the rest of the museum. We spent a lot of time in Red zone which covers earth, volcanos and earthquakes and a lot of time in blue zone which covers mammals and human biology. We left at 4pm and didn't get to everything. We had a very reasonably priced and tasty lunch in the Deli Cafe and needless to say dinosaur items and other things purchased at the well stocked shops. This was mine (not hubby's) and kids first visit to the NHM and we all came away talking endlessly about what a great day we had. Such a great place to visit and fantastic for kids as so interesting for them. I was apprehensive about the queues and the amount of time time we would have to wait but getting there half an early (remember, on a Sat) was a good choice. It must be said it got packed really quickly but I didn't find the crowds an issue. But seriously if you want to visit the dinosaur exhibit you need to be there early. We couldn't get over the queue when we were leaving at 4pm. Go early and avoid disappointment. Enjoy. ",Loved it
"March 1, 2015","What a great museum this place is, went with my wife and teenage daughter, she wasn't keen to go, but loved it when she was there. Well worth a visit and we do intend to go again as its too much to take in with one visit.Would recommend going early to try and avoid the queues, we literally walked straight in, when we came out a few hours later there were literally hundreds of people waiting to go in.",Definitely amazing
"February 27, 2015",That's the museum you don't skip. It's a complete day from open to close. One of the best ever I had seen. You will very satisfied after the visiting if you like the history. ,Trip without the kids for Anniversary
"February 11, 2015","It's an incredible building and free entry, what more do you want and inspiring to see so much from the T-Rex that greats you to the amazing choices and exhibits, where else can you find so many amazing fossils in one place! Wish we could have stayed longer, it's a whole days trip really, so much to see and study!",The best
"February 11, 2015",For me is the best museum I have been in my life is very complete and you have basically everything it is possible to have about the subject natural history. If you have children don't worry the museum at the same time you have the explanations for you have the same for the children.One of my favorite rooms is the dinosaurs where you have a gigantic robotic t-rex who growl at you. Absolutely amazing and please you need to take some of your time to see this museum. And the best thing....it's free =),Amazing place to see lots and lots of rocks.
"February 9, 2015","The natural history museum is a place you'll have to visit. There are lots and lots and lots of rocks.If you haven't seen enough rocks in your life. There are tons of rocks here. All sorts of rocks.Anyway, rocks aside, the exhibits are plentiful and truly worth the time to walk through if you're a science person. One can easily spend the day here to really have a look through all the exhibits.",Needs a good dusting!
"January 31, 2015","Visited this museum after the V&A, so had a lot to live up to. Please take a look over your big exhibits, covered in dust! Left soon after!",natural history museum
"April 10, 2015",We arrived at around half past ten and there were long queues at the main entrance. We decided to go to the Science Museum instead. When we turned the corner for the Science Museum we realised there was a second entrance which was nothing like as busy.The Natural History Museum is really a visit of at least three to four hours. There is plenty for people of all ages to see and do and it is free. Long queues formed to see the dinosaur exhibitions but we found that by carrying on around the rest of the exhibition by later in the afternoon we were able to just walk in- and it was worth the wait.One thing that it seemed not many visited but I would recommend was the film theatre where we watched two really interesting films- it also gave our feet a rest for half an hour!The whole place is full of interest and I would thoroughly recommend a visit.,So much to see!
"April 3, 2015","We had to pick and choose due to time constraints, but what we did see was very good. Highlights: dinosaurs, the escalator into the red Earth, the simulated earthquake inside a store, the dynamic, moving T-Rex, and the building itself, which is gorgeous.",A great tour of the world's flora and fauna.
"April 3, 2015","Dinosaur skeletons, whale skeletons, and stuffed versions of more recent animals from around the world (British Empire), put together by biologists and explorers, this may be the best of it's genre in the world.  Also, go across the street from the front entrance and take in the expanse of it's façade, really THE great example of Victorian architecture.  Just beautiful. Located next to the Science Museum AND the Victoria and Albert Museums, and only a few steps from Bromption Oratory, these should be set aside for ""Museum Day"" during your stay in London.",Free - go see it!
"March 30, 2015","Spent many hours in here, it's informative and well laid out.  Time well spent. Some of the exhibits are looking a little worn but you can still appreciate the reasons why they have not been replaced.",Feel like a kid again
"March 29, 2015","I have been in Natural History Museum almost every time I visit London and so I did the last time too. If you have kids, this is a ""must"" stop. Spend half a day inside the Museum, since your kids will love it. If you do not have kids, I almost have to propose the same thing. You will be surprised of the feeling to stroll in the different rooms of this amazing Museum. The entrance is free, but you may donate if you like. Totally recommended, do not miss it!!",Night at the Museum 3
"March 28, 2015","This was where the movie was filmed, and it looks even better in person!  It was quite busy for a Monday, so be prepared to see large crowds any time of year.",Great solo or with a family
"March 26, 2015",I flew through the museum on a Sunday so really just skimmed the surface but the value was still there.With so much to see it's hard not to find some really interesting 'nuggets' even if you're taking the express tour. It was clear though that with kids in tow you would get much more out of the experience (and there is no way you'd do it justice without spending the day).,Great day out with toddlers!
"March 26, 2015",Visited this museum with my two toddlers on a Saturday. Be prepared to queue up to enter as it is a very popular free attraction. The kids enjoyed the dinosaurs which are in the blue zone and once again you need to queue up to enter this zone. There are lifts to access the different levels which were convenient as we had the stroller too. The stuffed mammals and  the creepy crawlies too were a big hit with the kids. The restaurant was pretty expensive but there were microwaves at the exit doors to heat up milk or kids food which was convenient.  Overall a great day out and would encourage all to make a donation of £5 for which you get the brochure with the map of all the attractions and this donation will help to upkeep the maintenance of this wonderful museum for generations to come.,A good although noisy museum
"March 21, 2015",A very good and interesting experience and good set out although was full of school children so unable to truly appreciate the exhibits.,Amazing 
"March 17, 2015",Great place to travel with young children very informative and fun The volunteers are awesome think of it as their own home am sure if they get paid for this but their motivation levels are inspiring great job for anyone managing them ,Gorgeous inside and out!
"January 27, 2015","Be prepared to stand in a long line in order to get into this museum.  We waited for 2 hours, but it was worth the wait.  While waiting, enjoy the exterior architecture.  The stone creatures placed on the outside of the building entertain the eyes.  You walk into the museum and there on display is a dinosaur skeleton.  While the museum itself is free, there are exhibits for which tickets must be purchased.  Focus your tour of the museum on an area that is of interest.  There is too much to see.  Plan on spending 2 to 3 hours.  The gift shop is amazing.  I found a book called ""Sheep Keeping"" which I purchased for my daughter and the farmer with whom she works.",A beautiful building containing a world of wonders
"January 25, 2015","I don't like museums. But I love this one! Since my childhood and that of my children, I've never ceased to wonder at all it contains. Externally, it's a beautiful structure, built in the 1880s and adorned with sculptures of flora and fauna. Inside, its crammed with all manner of amazing things - dinosaurs, whales, specimens of birds, fish, creepy crawlies and creatures great and small. There are always special events or exhibitions of interest.It's a wonderful place for tourists, families and keen biologists, ornithologists and most other 'ologists' too. If you've never been, go now. If you've been before, go again, and again. Entrance is free and you'll always find things you've never seen before.",Wildlife Photography Exhibit was fantastic
"January 22, 2015","We stopped in this awesome museum for a quick visit to see this outstanding wildlife photography exhibit. It was fabulous. The images were unbelievable, and the time spent on a busy vacation well worth it. There was a fee for this particular exhibit, but it was entirely reasonable.",Behind the Scenes Tour
"January 19, 2015","We have been loads of times to the Natural History Museum but wanted to try something different so we booked onto a Behind the Scenes Tour in the Darwin Centre. There were just 8 of us on the tour, the guide took us around the labs where lots of research takes places, showed us how small carcasses are cleaned by flesh-eating beetles (you actually see them at work!) and then into the 'library' where thousands of specimens are stored in jars of alcohol. The stories were fascinating as were the things we saw, of special interest is a giant squid which stretches about 3 metres in a long, alcohol filled tank. The tour is free and well worth doing but allow time to find the starting place which wasn't very obvious!",The best day out in town AND IT IS FREE!!
"January 10, 2015","Especially with the kids, this is a great fun day out and free to enter.A fantastic treasure trove which cannot be fully explored in one day.Top tip - get there earlyTop tip - use side entrance as front entrance much busierTop tip - don't alway go for the obvious exhibitions; the less well known ones are not busy and often more interestingTop tip - ask for children's explorers packs in main hall receptionAlso Dinosnores; Children 7 - 11 can stay behind after hours and go on a torchlit tour of the dinosaur gallery snuggling down at midnight under the diplodocus skeleton - totally awesome.",You have to go.
"January 7, 2015","The museums of Exhibition Road are little different when it comes to this type of review, as weather you think they're good, bad or indifferent, makes no difference. They will always be required visiting. Luckily all three are very good at what they do and they should all be included in you London itinerary. The Natural History Museum is a fabulous building, packed with wonders that will fire you and your kids imaginations. Myself and J were bowled over by the entrance hall, let alone the rest of the building.",Something for everyone
"January 7, 2015","Free to enter, the Museum is open from 10.00am until 5.50pm, every day of the week, except Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day. This makes it the ideal destination in those quieter winter months, when children are on holiday and other attractions have already closed for the season. Once inside its hard not to have a favourite section, with most heading straight to the Dinosaur Gallery, as a result, there can be very large queues here, however you can totally avoid them by simply booking a FREE timed entry ticket on-line, via the museum's own website. At the allotted time you choose, you just walk past the queue, show your printed at home ticket to the staff and enter. Perfect! But there really is a lot more than just Dinosaurs here, in fact there is something for everyone to enjoy and its almost impossible to come away without learning something new and interesting . As a child I remember being highly impressed by the size of the Blue Whale, whilst on our most recent visit I thoroughly enjoyed experiencing an artificial earthquake, the ground actually shaking beneath my feet as I stood in the Kobe Supermarket earthquake machine. You can easily spend an entire day walking around here, so do plan on eating too. Food and drinks although very good quality, is rather expensive, so anyone on a budget, or with lots of hungry children to feed, should pack a picnic and head down to the basement for lunch, where you will find a dedicated picnic zone. I also suggest bringing along some coins, so children can help support the museum with a donation. Finally don't forget the camera, which you can use everywhere without flash.",I would rate it as the best of all london museums.
"January 1, 2015","I would rate this museum as the best of all London Museums. The dinosaurs are unmissable and blue zone contains lots of information about mammal's but the star for me is the red zone. In short, there is plenty for everyone to enjoy.",Waste of time
"December 13, 2014",Visited here as a child and then about 8 years ago To sum it up AWFUL half the exhibits have disappeared for a museum to be part of the new night at the museum film would have been nice to have an exhibition about that Couldn't get in half the dinosaur display due to queues staff hanging around bored senseless. And the security search is just ridiculous Hardly surprising it's free to get in can't see anyone paying,Fun afternoon with the dino's
"December 6, 2014","One thing I love about London Museums is that they are free.  This fact makes it easy to visit and  do one exhibit at a time.  As this is all my back can handle, my son and I did the Dinosaur exhibit the other day.  Educational and fun with real and fake ""dino's"".  We had a great time looking at the fossils and reading about the ancient animals.  The building is beautiful, very ""British"" with lots of history of its own.  In the winter they have an outdoor ice skating rink.  A fun day out for any age.",Dinosaurs!
"November 16, 2014","Tube station conveniently located around the corner from a tube station (South Kensington) the museum is not only very interesting, it is completely free! The dinosaur bones are a joy to behold & i feel privileged to have seen them a couple of times now. For anyone interested in history or dinosaurs you can't get much better",Fantastic Museum! Awesome exhibitons and FREE!
"November 14, 2014","I love the Natural History Museum! It is a fantastic place that is made even better by the fact that it is free! The dinosaur exhibit is great fun for younger and older kids as well as informative.  The mammals section is also really cool with a huge stock of specimens and the sheer size of the blue whale is awesome in itself.  The human body section is also very well done but my favourite exhibit is the geology wing. They have an enormous wing full of all of these different minerals with the larger more spectacular specimens in larger cases on the sides. Then, at the end of the wing, there is the vault, which is full of massive gemstones and jewels with shadowy history. Finally on the top floor is the section of an enormous tree with major events in history noted on the rings. There are many photo opportunities available throughout the museum but the tree and the main hall are the most spectacular. There is a cafe on the ground floor, which is a little expensive if you're travelling on a budget so if you want to save money bring your own food. It is very well signed and there are employees everywhere so you don't need to buy a map but it is a cool souvenir. Also they currently have an ice rink set up outside but I don't know much about prices.",Great Museum to visit.
"November 12, 2014",My wife an I visited this Museum and we wished that we had brought our kids on this trip.  Children will love this museum.,Tired
"November 6, 2014",We headed for this place having never visited before and found it very disappointing. It seemed very drab and displays were poorly presented. The majority were aimed at the very young but even those seemed poorly done. An animated scorpion looked dusty and grubby in need of a wash. The splendid entrance hall with the dinosaur skeleton was all there was to be pleased with and one area was off limits to us as the lift was out of order and having mobility problems we could go no further. It's sad that such a famous building is so badly displayed and tended. It may be free entry but this is no excuse to let a fine institution such as this become so tired. We will not return and I would advise going to the British museum or the National gallery rather than waste your time with this.,Truly excellent.
"November 5, 2014",For kicks it's free which is  the best price for a museum.  Queues can get large though for a reason. Lots of fascinating exhibits and well worth a few hours of your time. ,The best museum in London in my opinion!
"November 4, 2014","The best museum, plus free, plus it is interesting to pretty much everyone who comes to visit London. The British history, for instance, might not interest quite a lot of people, natural history is interesting to almost everybody. We always take everyone who visits us in London to this museum, at least to the Dinosaurs gallery.",Dinosaurs
"November 1, 2014",I loved it and I especially loved the dinosaurs.There was a lot of interesting things to see.I am only     six years old.,Dinos!
"October 6, 2014","I've been here many times before, but each time is better than the last. It's very kid friendly, especially the Dinosaur exhibit which I go to every time, even with the tiring long queues. This time I also visited the Darwin Centre which was intriguing and very interesting, though creepy crawlies isn't exactly my best loved thing...Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to go the Mammoth exhibit which I was dying to go to and was then closing soon, but we were on a tight schedule.",Super collection shame about the heat
"September 30, 2014","We visited London with three children aged 2, 6 and 7 and they loved it. The newer section is very interactive with the volunteers being great with the kids visiting. Although it was roasting hot inside. All together a great visit!","Great specimens , horrible implementation"
"September 5, 2014",Wow is this place a disappointment.  Dead ends everywhere. Rooms with plywood floors and drop ceilings.  Terrible flow.  No logical flow.  No modern interactions.  The entire place needs to be redone with one coherent design.  England needs to step up.,Dinos!

"September 1, 2014","Large museums need more than one visit to take it all in. Quite a few sections of the Natural History Museum, especially the human body are out-dated and some interactive displays don't work. The Charles Darwin section is good but even that lacked the interpretive qualities found in several other great museums of the world. Given the time spent in the queue and the superficial brochure offered for 5 pounds all told a disappointing visit.",Impressive on the outside...
"September 1, 2014","The building looks amazing from the outside. You would expect the place to b spacious to walk around with impressive displays etc.....It's not. I understand that it was the tail end of the summer holidays but even if it hadn't have been so busy it would still have been poor. Having been to the small Natural history museum in Tring I expected this to be far better but Tring wins hands down. Queued forever to see a slightly realistic looking T Rex that moves it's neck,  there were a couple of animated raptors. The whole place was boiling hot and cramped. The model blue whale was pretty impressive along with its model skeleton. Nearly everything interactive either didn't work or was crap. My gf and I were bored and couldn't wait to leave and found out afterwards thay even my 3 daughters were who are 6, 8 and 10 were bored....Thank London for the science museum next door that was great. Spacious, cooler. A room with a bunch of things for kids to play in and generally more interesting. 2 stars is generous really.",too many people - nightmare
"August 20, 2014"," way too many people - its impossible to enjoy it, You will spend all time waiting in queue - so hot there no air con. I just dindnt like it, nothing special- just stuffed animals, I think for the space they got and moneys - it should be done better.  There is dinosaurs skeletons- but so many people there it was impossible to see it - just a busy day in mcdonald. ",Dissapointing
"August 20, 2014","Been there before but never saw the dinosaur section. This time around waited 30 minutes in a queue to get in the museum and 30 minutes to get to the blue dinosaur section, only for the layout to be completely useless and it to be less impressive than expected. On the plus side some sections of this museum are interesting and the building is nice, staff also seem pretty friendly., plus the museum is free and the overall sum of all its content fairly good.",Wonderful day out! So much to see and do!
"August 18, 2014","I visited the museum with my boyfriend and had a wonderful day. We initially planned to spend the morning in the museum but when we arrived we realised that it would take all day to see and appreciate everything. We had to wait to get in but the line was no longer that 20 minutes and for a free attraction that is so amazing a wait is worth it. We were lucky as there was no wait for the dinosaur exhibit when we arrived and were able to see it without hassle. The dinosaurs are really a must see, along with the mammoth exhibit on show at the moment. The only downside was that the museum was very warm once it became busy and the cafe facilities were also overcrowded. Other than that we had a wonderful day and would gladly return to see the things we missed! ",Absolute Letdown!
"August 14, 2014",Queued for an hour got to the entrance only to be told there was a fire alarm and the staff didn't know when we were allowed in so we were told to queue for half an hour round the side door we weren't going to queue again no way so we left very annoyed and disappointed.Lets just say we won't be going back again ever a complete letdown.,Don't go at this time of year
"August 14, 2014","We went on 13 August.  It was unacceptably busy. My children  were appalled at all the stuffed animals - didn't really help the by explaining that the Victorians thought it was okay or that explorers brought them back to England - our children simply thought it was wrong and couldn't understand why they were allowed to be displayed - probably an indication that these museums will soon enough have had their day.The building was uncomfortably busy.  We arrived at 1015 and did not queue to get in but, like others, were shocked at the queue for the dinosaurs and simply gave it a miss.We're not prepared to pay £10 per adult for the mammoths exhibit as standard of other exhibits didn't inspire us to believe it might be worth it.Blue whale hugely disappointing - poorly painted in times past - not up to standard.I just don't  think you can get away with running a museum on the basis that this us what museums used to be like ... This is a museum of a museum and needs to be dramatically updated.I also experienced the taps in bathroom that do not work - probably not surprising with the huge visitor numbers and I would be interested in the fire safety side of this building with the huge numbers of people allowed inside. We sought sanctuary in the cafe where the 8 & 7 year old had ""the best ever ice cream"" - hallelujah for a plus!We left at about 12 and by this time folks were queuing out into the street for entry - folks it's just not worth it!Maybe okay to return in the off season?Oh, we also struggled with directional signage which could be much improved.Overall I do not recommend this to anyone at this time of year.Yes I would return in the off season but I expect my children (7 & 8) will not want to, so horrified were they at the dead animals they simply thought it was macabre.  Preschoolers will probably love it if there is no queuing.  Overall...time for a rethink museum people :/(.",Good but tired 
"August 10, 2014","Firstly get there early. We arrived at 0930 at one of the side entrances, and was second in the queue. Secondly if you want to see the dinosaurs go there first. Then meant us walking past loads but worth it. Later in the day massive wait. Then start making your way around the rest. Some exhibits a little tired, still there after 20 years.With little ones three hours will do it. Cafés available but quite pricey. ",Extremely buggy unfriendly
"August 6, 2014","Don't bother visiting if your child is in a buggy. The whole place is buggy-unfriendly and you'll spend a v-e-r-y l-o-n-g t-i-m-e waiting for lifts. I gave up in the end - before we'd got a sniff of a dinosaur. That said, it's free, so it's churlish of me to complain.",Great family day out for free!
"August 3, 2014","we arrived at the museum at 9:30 and there was a queue but we didn't mind just watch as people like to push in, we got into the museum and went straight to the dinosaur section (do this first as it gets very busy and you will queue for ages) the boys loved this part and there is a moving trex. we looked around the whole museum which was good there is a lot of walking but you don't really notice till afterwards.The inside picnic area was all good was cool and plenty of tables and seats for all.The only thing I would say is that there is really any entrance and exits so everybody squeezes through small doors and can get cramped also would like hand gels around as theres a lot of things to touch, it is also very hot in some parts.we left around 13:30 and to our surprise people were still waiting to get in.all in all was a good day out and we will be visiting again",Fab fab fab!
"August 2, 2014",My 13 year old loved it and considering his interest in life is his xbox that is a big plus! Sadly didn't get to see it all as it got too hot and stuffy in there. We will go back though in cooler weather,Great museum for free
"July 26, 2014","Arrived around 11am today, from the Exhibition Road entrance, there was no queue so walked straight in :)  Went as a family with 16mth old and 8yr old, 8 year old really enjoyed it, reading about everything in a way which was easy to understand. Was busy to go around with a pushchair but found everything we wanted to see accessible. Enjoyed the earthquakes and vulcanoes exhibition and seeing the blue whale. We prebooked our dinosaur gallery tickets and glad we did, meant we could go to the front of the queue. Only spent about 2 and a half hours there overall as it felt too hot walking around, would love to go back to spend more time looking around on a cooler day.",Very warm but worth the visit
"July 26, 2014",It was an extremely hot day when we visited and some of the smaller exhibit halls in the red zone were unbearable.  Blue and green zones where much better though although we couldn't stay as long as we wanted due to the heat.  Worth a revisit on a cooler day.,Great free venue
"July 8, 2014","Really enjoyed learning about earthquakes!  the bat event was amazing and I got to talk to a lovely long eared bat!  the highlight for me had to be the butterfly exhibition, only £5 entry but just peaceful and magical, only a small area but I lost an hour in there, I would highly recommend it.",Too busy and have seen better
"July 8, 2014","My wife and I thought that it would be a great experience to go to the Natural History Museum,  however,  what we saw the most of was people's backs school groups pushing through and some very inconsiderate people shoving their way through the long queues. Of the very few displays, that we did get to spend more time at they were often broken or in a state of much needed repair. The building itself is fantastic however for the effort required to navigate the crowds, there are much better museums around the world to visit. ","Educational, Fun & Inspiring"
"July 7, 2014","I love the Natural History Museum and try to make sure I visit every time I go to London.  The quality of what is on display is second to none.  The Darwin Centre was extremely inspiring, especially to be able to see scientists at work (try to go in the week as they don't work weekends).  Everything was reasonably priced (especially considering you are in London) and the staff were all wonderful.  Old or young, there is something for everyone - there's a good mix of things to see and do.  The building itself is beautiful, and it is spotlessly clean inside.  There's everything from Dinosaurs to plants and art.",Such an interesting place.
"July 3, 2014","A wonderful day at the Museum. The section of the Kobe Earthquake was quite impressive.Dinosaurs and Mammals are a must see. Possibility of interaction together with an educational approach capture the attention of the whole family. Be warned, though, if you are truly interested in the exhibitions, one day might not be enough. If you are visiting but do not have more than two or three days to devote to the Museum, it might be wise to choose the areas that interest you the most, and leave the others for another future visit. You can get an overall look of rooms and exhibitions online, print a few maps and then decide on what you prefer.Tip: don't miss the T-Rex!!",A must visit museum
"August 13, 2012","Whenever I visit London, my kids insist that we visit the Natural History Museum. Obviously the dinosaurs are a big attraction 9you can book free tickets so you don't have to queue but I needn't have bothered as the Olympics meant a half-empty museum (relatively) and no queue at all. The animated dinosaurs are really good. The museum has good interactive displays, those in the human body area are good fun, visitors with kids should try to visit the basement's easily missed kids' hands-on area where children can handle fossils and play with a wide range of exhibits rather than just look at them. The huge mammals hall is well worth a look too. The museum will take all day to explore and will tire you out so plan what you want to see if you have less time.During non-Olympic visits I have found the side entrance has smaller queues, we didn't have to queue at all. In the past this museum has been very busy so go early if you dislike crowds.",Brilliant for young kids
"August 11, 2012","We travelled to London for the Olympic games and were there for a couple of days. On our first day in London we used Tesco Vouchers from the exchange service to take our 4 & 2year old daughters on a bus tour around London. The Original Tour Company accept vouchers and have 3different routes. One of these is called the museum route and takes you right past the front door of the Natural History Museum. This was a great service and the kids loved sitting on top of the bus watching the world go by and waving at people. Once we got to the museum, we walked in and a tour guide called Mark, asked if we had visited before. When we said no, he pulled us aside and spent 10 minutes telling us what the best areas would be for our kids to get the most out of the museum. We were in the museum for 4 hours which absolutely flew in and we only got to see a small part of the museum. Obviously the dinosaur exhibit is a must, but one gem we found only because we spoke to Mark was the Investigate Centre on the ground Floor. This is an area where kids can touch, measure, draw, weigh, and become involved loads of different things. My eldest daughter spent an hour going round the exhibit, selecting items and drawing, measuring and weighing them, and looking at them under the microscopes. She absolutely loved it, and would easily have spent more time in there. Only negative to the whole day is that food is expensive, but the museum itself is free and you could spend days in it looking at the exhibits. After leaving the museum we again hopped on the bus tour, and then changed routes to the main route and let the kids see the main sights of London. All in all it was a great day, and I would not hesitate to take our kids here again.","Amazing Building, Great Exhibits"
"July 12, 2012",We toured the National History Museum with our 4 and 7 year old boys.  They loved the kid friendly exhibits and the dinosaur fossils.  We (Mom and Dad) loved the architecture of this amazing building.  ,I cannot believe that a museum like this is free
"July 9, 2012","Do not leave London without visiting this museum. Take advantage of the low price... $0.00Excellent day out for the whole family, enjoyed the dinosaurs section the most.","Great Museum, Terrible Message"
"July 4, 2012","The Natural History Museum has an absolutely amazing collection; there is no doubt about it. And it offers a fantastic day out. But I am afraid that I cannot stand the place.What was a museum founded by Sir Richard Owen to display the glory of nature has become a temple to Darwinism. Sir Richard's statue was in fact taken from the front and put to the back, while Darwin's was put in its place (they were actually sworn enemies). Only one explanation is ever offered for the history of the universe and living things, and that is the evolution theory/naturalism.Creationism is openly mocked, while the huge gaps in the theory of evolution and our knowledge of natural history is glossed over repeatedly. I studied the Laetoli tracks at the museum and it is crystal clear they are the feet of an anatomically modern human, yet the museum insists they belonged to Australopithecus Afarensis, which is a complete impossibility. Then again, if you have shot yourself in the foot (pun intended) by saying they are 3.5 million years old what are you going to do? If you are looking for indoctrination then this is the place - if you are looking for empirical science you will be sadly disappointed.",Great Museum but Avoid School Holidays (and Wet Days)!
"June 18, 2012","Spent half a day there last week but must admit a lot of that was due to the fatal mistake of going during half term on a very wet day. It is a wonderful museum but it was very overcrowded when we visited and the Dinosaur section in particular got very claustrophobic with the crowds on the walkways. Accessabiliy was also an issue as a number of lifts were not working which caused problems for people like myself who are disabled and also caused problems for parents with large buggies having to try to go back through the crowded ""one way system"" to get the buggies back to ground level. A lesson could be learned here from the wonderful Castle Museum in York - Have a buggy park and rent carriers for the youngsters.  The museum is too crowded for these large buggies.The Earth Zone is very interesting.Maps can be purchased for £1 and they are well laid out and easy to follow. The Dinosaur section would have been a lot more enjoyable without the crowds.It is a very good and interesting museum but our visit was spoiled by the overcrowding and the ""out of order"" lifts.We had planned on going to the science museum afterwards but we reckoned that would be even more crowded so gave it a miss on this visit.",Excellent museum for people of all ages!
"May 14, 2012","Visited this musem together with my 76 years old father, my brother (35) an my son (6) and we all had a lovely day. There was quite a queue when we arrived at 11. AM but we tookk turns to stand in the line and the others could walk around in the park or visit the small shop outside. Perhaps a shorter queu if you arrive at 10 when they opened. There are soooo much to look at in this museum but we started with the dinousaur exhibition, then we looked at spiders, snakes and insects for like an hour and finally the vault with beautiful rocks, diamonds, and glittering things. We left the museum at appr 4.30 PM and had then also had lunch and a coffe break in the museum. It was a perfect day and we all could find interesting things to look at. The building it self is worth a visit. Like a castle or an ancient church. An its free!! :D",Educational even for adults
"May 12, 2012","I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here.  The dinosaur exhibition was really educational and I have learnt much.  For how impressive the exhibits are, I am very grateful that it was free.",Fantastic
"May 7, 2012","I take my childen, age 8 &6, to the museum every few months.Its a stunning building & an amazing place.You could spend the entire weekend wondering around, there is SO much to see and do.My son held a held a milk snake during a live animal show on our last visit.We always take a picnic and eat it in the main hall.I really cound't recommend this place enough :)",Very interesting
"April 10, 2012","The museum is enormous and has a lot to see. I found it very interesting, it takes you back to the begining of the world until now. You can see the era of the dinosaurs, our era, the animals that live in our planet, etc.I recomend it!",A must see even while battling the crowds!
"June 30, 2011","We visited the Natural HistoryMuseum with four kids under the ages of ten and a baby in a stroller on a hot and humid London day without any of the fans or AC really working in the museum and almost all tourists in London deciding to visit the museum on the same day... Or so it seemed!!! And yet... We LOVED it!!! Despite our slowness with all these kids in tow, we managed to visit the dinosaur exhibit, the mammals and sea life and the Darwin hall... The kids were in awe with the dinosaurs, the fun facts, the volunteers who patiently held up various skulls and listened to the kids' questions and the sheer size and authenticity of everything.  We have been through several natural history museums in our globe trotting but this is the mother of all museums!!! Truly one of a kind, cannot be beat. I would say it is the number one must see attraction in London... Just realizing the size of the life-like blue whale and taking a good look at a real life T-rex should be good enough reasons to visit. Indeed the dinosaur exhibit is incomparable to anything else we have seen and if you have a day like ours then even spending the time for this ONE exhibit is still worth it. Oh and it is free too!!! One more thing-- even though the butterfly center is not free (next door in the same yard as the museum) do not miss it!!! Plus for a family of five it was just 20 pounds and well worth the experience of seeing so many live and dazzling butterflies!",With young children a planned quick visit is best
"July 23, 2013","This was our first visit to the Natural History Museum and we probably should have planned better.  We were with our 2, 4 and 6 year old daughters and it was towards the end of our 2 day London visit so energy levels were not great.  Our initial idea of covering off all areas (albeit walking through some quicker than others) was a mistake as some exhibits had little chance of holding the interest of our young daughters.  Instead we should have just headed straight to the mammals area (which was excellent) and then the dinosaurs (good but a little overrated given the queues).  The Natural History Museum is an excellent free attraction but with young children it needs to be a short targeted visit, and any attempt to see it all should be forgotten.",A fantastic London museum!!
"June 12, 2013","This is one of the best museums I have ever visited. The Dinosaur collection is truly special & definitely my favourite bit. Try to get here early or on a weekday, because the queues can be long!",Sensational Butterflies Exhibition
"June 1, 2013","I went to the Sensational Butterflies Exhibition at The Natural History Museum, the butterflies were very cool and seeing them eat fruits. You get a piece of paper to stamp the life-cycle of a butterfly on your way through and there is a GREAT gift shop right outside of the butterfly exhibit.",Natural History Museum
"May 27, 2013","This museum was wonderful a great place to take children.  There were different lifeforms , the dinosaurs were amazing and some were interactive and computer generated.  The building is beautiful.  There was a section of a giant sequoia tree from San Francisco. There are stuffed animals.  Everything was just amazing. There is always a large crowd.",Worst website in natural history
"May 12, 2013","Sorry I have to write this one after spending one hour booking two tickets for the main exhibition.Visiting roughly 100 pages with all the 'this page cannot be displayed' error messages, get forced to enter all my details for a one off transaction, get 2 of my cards refused by the system. Appalling!Not to mention the 'voluntary' charity contribution and the ridiculous 1.50£ booking fee -excuse me but why?- and the fact that the website does not mention anywhere before the end of the transaction that the tickets have to be printed.Must cost them 50% of their online business, good for them.",Make sure you visit the 'Investigate' centre in the basement if you have children - simply superb
"May 11, 2013","We've been to the Natural History Museum a couple of times, but recently discovered the 'investigate' centre in the basement. This is simply a fantastic facility, and not to be missed when you visit London! Suitable for kids age 3 up, this is a fantastic hands-on room. There are optical microscopes, digital microscopes, scales, measures, investigation sheets and there are samples galore - insects, shells, rocks, animals. The thing that really makes it is the staff - so helpful, and the kids were absolutely fascinated. My 3 year old was addicted to looking at shells under the microscope, and my 5 year old was drawing pictures of insects, measuring them, weighing them, looking up the details on the computers or in the books and asking countless questions.This is really not to be missed - I suspect it gets busy, so try for a quiet time (early morning?) and watch out because it does shut 30mins before the rest of the museum.After 90 mins in there, I had to drag the kids out as we needed to head home - even then they pleaded with me to go back in...The rest of the museum is also well worth visiting - my children love the dinosaurs as well as  the insect section, but the investigate centre turns a good location into a fantastic one.",A great day out!
"April 27, 2013","After spending an hour and more in the queue I was finally able to get in the museum and realized that wait was totally worth! A giant skeleton of dinosaur welcomes you. The entire place looks so awesome. I enhoyed watching everything from fossils, to stones & diamonds to birds etc etc. Kohinoor was icing on the cake!",Highly recommended for families with young children -  Come early
"April 22, 2013",You should come early the queues are long fast (if you planning to come here weekend or school holidays ) Admission is free.  Highly recommended for families with children..But nobody will disappointing for sure. The dinosaur exhibition is - epic. This is very organized and well presented museum.,Interesting.....
"April 9, 2013","Very interesting, make sure you have plenty of time to have a good look around....The dinosaurs were very impressive, and great for the kids ",A bit dated and worn
"February 6, 2013","I have been to a lot of museums, and they seem to be going for a more interactive, engaging approach to their subject matter.  Not so here.  This is still very much a 1970's style of museum -  small plaques describing static displays.The museum is free, so all in all it is worth the time if you happen to be in the Kensington / Hyde Park area and have a couple of hours to kill.  Not sure I would plan a day around it, however.",Well worth a trip...go early
"June 21, 2011","We (myself, my wife and 12 year old daughter) went to the Natural History Museum over the Easter break. We did not attend the paid dinosaur show so cannot comment on the value of that. We spent hours looking at the various displays...my daughter loved the dinosaurs section; we found the catwalk to be an effective way to introduce the subject (cannot resist the pun in that it provided a good overview of the dinosaurs). Considering we live near Drumheller in Alberta (home of a wonderful dinosaur museum) we had no negatives in this section. The Darwin Center is also very interesting; when the scientists and researchers are there must be even better. The were lots of thoughtful and interactive displays. In essence I could see my daughter engaging in some of the research topics and concepts. The section leading to the geology and earth science areas is interesting as well. Overall, lots to see and do.The museum is well laid out (cannot comment on food as we did not eat there) and staff are friendly if they are asked questions. It is a great place to spend a few hours; go early as it gets busy and can be uncomfortably crowded by noon. It is a good walk from the tube station but it is well signed.",Great day for adults and children.
"June 13, 2011","What a fantastic place! Brilliantly done - plenty to keep you amused for hours, and all for free!! Like another reviewer, I used to get taken here as a child - and going back for the first time in about 25 years, I expected to be disappointed (As the other reviewer clearly was!)Quite the opposite - all my expectations were exceeded - I had a great time. To those who say that the pay for dinosaur bit wasn't worth a tenner (or £28 for a family) - I wouldn't know, as there was so much to do everywhere else in the museum that I ran out of time - but I will happily pay the cash next time we go for the opportunity to contribute to the overall experience which is easily worth a lot more than that.take your kids, or just yourselves - have fun and allow plenty of time to get round the engaging exhibitions!!",Great place for all ages
"June 7, 2011","We took our 4 year old son to see the dinosaurs. We are not big museum lovers but the NH museum is one of a kind. There is plenty to see and do and the free dinosaur part is brilliant. HOWEVER we also paid to get into the Age of the Dinosaur exhibition  - £10 per adult and £6 per child. And it is definately NOT worth this - we lasted about 5 minutes in it. There were a few more animated dinosaurs in a time exhibition . NOT worth the extra money.The catering facilites looked great, the lous were very clean and it was easy to get around. No need for the £1 map!",Real letdown
"April 25, 2011","I loved this museam when i was little and my dad used to take me there. We were in London today with our three children so we thought we'd hop on the underground and show them the wonders. Firstly, couldn't believe the half hour queue, all to have some bored woman shine a torch in my bag...what a complete waste of time! Never had to queue in the past. Obviously the museam is free but the extra exhibits and food are extortionate! All the areas looked tired and worn, covered in dust, broken, and i hate to say it but unless you are 5, boring. Where were all the cases of artifacts, rocks, minerals...? Never found the treasures of the earth bit....sorry but will not be going back.",jurrassic display not worth a visit
"April 24, 2011",museum is ok the new jurrassic display is a total waste of money £28 for a family of four  it has four moving displays and takes all of ten minutes to go round  food is expensive £8 for a large roll  good museum bad food terrible display,Great place for any day - beware the half term queues
"February 23, 2011","Queued to get in – but then it was half term and to be expected.  There are roadworks outside the Victoria and Albert museum which made the place look untidy on Exhibition Road.  Once in, very busy.  Got very hot and unfortunately because of the queues outside we were unable to leave and come back in again without queuing.  If going at a peak time make sure you have a bottle of water with you (or get one from the shop).  Overall a pleasant and enjoyable experience with plenty of things to look at and read.  I would go again but not when the kids are off school.",Teachers should remember their pupils are not the only visitors to the museum and show some respect to others.
"October 22, 2010","I visited the Natural History Museum yesterday with my son.  Our day was completely spoiled by groups of noisy, out-of-control school parties with teenagers who were quite clearly completely disinterested in the museum and only wanted to rush around shouting and screaming, texting and being a nuisance to others.In the Zoology Spirit Building one group of youths were pushing a low, wooden bench like structure on wheels from one end of the corridor to the other, whooping and cheering.   The accompanying teacher just glanced over his shoulder but said nothing.  The same lack of discipline was shown by another group upstairs.  We went into the mineral gallery just to get away from them.   Groups of younger children were better behaved but the teenagers seemed to view the visit as an opportunity to show off and draw attention to themselves - absolutely pathetic.I'm not an old fuddy duddy and in fact my neighbour who is in his twenties had exactly the same experience and vows never to go to this Museum again.  The Museum should employ staff to control this sort of behaviour as it appears teachers accept this as normal behaviour and do nothing to correct these selfish youngsters who spoil things for others.",Dinosaur Exhibition!
"May 20, 2010","This free museum is in the museum district Kensington, next to the Victoria & Albert Museum and Science Museum. It is big and other sections also looked great, but with 2 boys of 5 and 7 years with a short attention span we went straight to the section with the Dinosaur exhibition. Many big skeletons, fossils, and reproductions and set-up as a walking path tour based on a (chrono-)logical information flow. A great museum experience.",Great Dinosaurs
"April 9, 2010","You could easy spend a full day in here and it is easy to loose track of time. The dinosaur exhibit is excellent, great displays and children will love the live 'T-Rex'. There are lots of other things to see, travel to the top floor to see the section of a sequoia tree, it's huge. It's free to get in which is a bonus in London, plenty for kids to do also. Recommend having a look on the website first to find out what you want to see and make that your priority, pick up a map when you go in, you will spend longer in here than you think. If there are lots of school parties in avoid the indoor picnic area as the tables when we went were nearly all reserved for the schools and we ended up sitting on the floor.",What an experience
"January 15, 2013",We had to queue to get in on a Saturday morning. Because it's free it's very popular with London familes as well as visitors. We were in within 10 minutes. Plenty of staff inside and outside to help visitors.I don't know what we expected as it was our first visit but we were there most of the day and returned the following day and still only got a superficial look. It's one of those places that you would return to time and time again. The exhibits from dinosaurs to volcanoes are simply world class.Weekends might be best avoided because of the crowds.Unless you're starving don't eat there. I could have got a 3 course meal outside in Cromwell Road for the price we paid for 2 buns and 2 cups of tea.,"free , so much to see and do"
"December 28, 2012","We love this as it's free and you can do so much. The only downside is the food is horrendously expensive, the downstairs cafe where the picnic area is was sold out of sandwiches by 1pm and the service was so slow, my husband ran out for a cigarette, went to the shop, on his return I still had not been served 20 minutes later. As most of the clientelle are parents with little kiddies the food prices are extortionate. I understand the rest is free so it's one way to recoup money but what was on offer was trying to be up market but was actually dire. So like most families we bring out own .The exhibits are all great, the signs could be better as people were wondering around lost, and staff were not exactly helpful. The discovery centre for kiddies downstairs was great fun , the kids enjoyed it too !! There was a 45 min queue for the dinos so we went to see the creepy crawlies instead. The staff need to wear name badges prominently and be more recognisable, our little one got dislodged from us in a crowd and she didn't know whom to ask for help.",NHM - Important Information for Muslim Tourists
"December 25, 2012","Another visit to the Natural History Museum and this time a couple more tips.  The queues at the main Cromwell Rd entrance was very large but the Entrance at the Exhibition Rd was empty so use that one.There is also a Faith Room right in front of the Exhibition Rd Entrance, you cant miss it, next to the First Aid Room so you can use that for your prayers, it is a small room but there are benches just outside so you can wait if it is busy.  We didn't check the ablution facilities as we had been to the Science Museum and used one of the many bathrooms there for Wudhu.Hope that helps.",Shadow of what it was
"December 12, 2012",Totally gutted by my experience of this once amazing museum. I'm quite sure the research etc done is as important as ever but what the public are now allowed to see is a fraction of what it was 20 years ago. Thought the whole point going to a museum was to see amazing things. This museum is only for under 12 year olds-  you'd be as well  reading an educational book than going here now.,Ice Rink open for the Winter
"November 4, 2012","We all know that the NHM is probably one of the wonders of the world and is a great trip ANY day of the year, but the ice rink outside is well worth booking up, I have given it only 4 stars at when you are a family of 5 it is a little expensive to be as inclusive as the museum has always been. One important tip, buy your tickets and print them off before you get there, it is run like clockwork, meaning everyone gets their time on the ice (just under an hour, which is more than enough) and the rink does't feel crowded and there are plenty of helpers around to keep things moving, clearing the fallen bodies etc.... give it a go and have fun, another tip, you get very warm skating.",Brilliant day out :-)
"October 9, 2012","WOW what a great day out, we visited on a Saturday which in hindsight is probably not the best day as it was VERY busy, we had to queue for about 20 minutes to get in (arrived 1030). What a building from the entrance hall to all the zones its awe-inspiring,  on entering you are confronted with a huge dinosaur exhibit, this grabs the kids attention straight away, The dinosaur zone is just amazing, its hard to believe these creatures used to roam the earth, again the queues were annoying to get round the zone but still does not take away from the experience.Another must see is the blue whale, my family and i just stared at the display for ages, the size of it is incredible. Yes i did notice lots of dust on top of these exhibits but SO what!! This is a free experience people stop winging at silly things, the staff at the museum are doing a great job in keeping hundreds of thousands of visitors every year entertained, well done to them all.We were at the museum for 3 hours and only got through half the zones, so put a whole day aside to really see everything.The onsite restaurant is reasonably priced for London. The toilets are clean and tidy.The museum is free to enter, the guide book is only £5 and i highly recommend buying both the adult and childrens ones as they are packed full of information and facts about the different exhibits.Reading through other reviews it makes me laugh that some people moan about the number of children around the museum!!! How on earth do these people expect kids to learn?? My kids soaked up all the information they learnt like a sponge and i do not expect them to act like they are living in Victorian times, if you dont like children then visit somewhere else!! While i was looking at exhibits plenty of ADULTS pushed in front of me, but i just let it go like everyone else should.This is a fantastic place to visit, i cant wait to return. I highly recommend all ages to visit :-)",Amazing museum for adults and children alike
"September 18, 2012","This museum is my absolute favourite destination and a place I recommend to all visitors to London. Beautiful dinosaur fossils, semi precious minerals and animal specimens frozen in time are abundant. As a child we'd visit this museum at least once a year as a school trip, yet there is plenty at this museum for adults. As a child I never noticed the beautiful stone walls, covered in beautiful carved animals. The Darwin Center is a relatively recent addition and contains Darwin's original research tomes. Windows into the core of the building allow visitors to observe scientists at work. One can't help but be inspired by the Natural History Museum. It is an absolutely brilliant and magical place.",free & very interactive
"September 16, 2012","This museum is free (as many others) and very interactive. It's very nice, you could visit with children and spend all day. Don't forget to visit the (free) science museum next door.",Good. Masses to see.
"September 10, 2012",Liked: everything we saw.Would take days to see it all.To many of the interactive things were broken & some were a bit dated.  Needs the same revamp the Science Museum seems to have had.,A dreadful experience
"August 29, 2012","We were so dissapointed with our experience at the Natural History Museum. I really hope that such a negative experience can be put down to us visiting on a Bank Holiday Monday! My partner and I arrived in London with our daughter early afternoon. We thought the Natural History Museum would be a great experience to fill the rest of our afternoon. How wrong were we! The queue  to get in was horrific - it took 45 minutes. Once eventually in the buliding we had to view the vast majority of exibits in what  can only describe as a claustrophobic queue, due to the sheer volume of people, and the bizarre layout of the buliding. Taking a decent photo was impossible - too many people who seemed to lack manners and consideration to others! On a positive note it is a beautiful building. Can see why it's free to get in though!!",Great Free Museum
"January 6, 2010","2nd visit to this museum, since we first went a year ago my little boy has been constantly asking to go back to the ""Dinosaur Museum"".Dinosaur section was fantastic again but very very busy.Great day out, you need to allow a full day to go round it, or just an hour for the dinosaur section.  Brilliant for the kids, especially the animated T-Rex.  And its FREE.",Good day out but have a plan.
"August 12, 2009","Make sure, if you have children you pick up the explorers pack from the information desk. It is free and will give the children something to focus on. There is a lot to see in this museum so I would suggest you go and focus on one thing. My children like the dinosaurs but make sure you go either first  thing or after 5pm when there are little queues. We usually do 2 trips and spend 2 hours there seeing the things we like and avoid wondering around, which would take up and entire day. Make sure you take the children to the basement where there are lots of microscopes and real exhibits they can get their hands on. Avoid the summer months if possible, and avoid buying food inside the museum. There is a Tesco Metro on Old Bromton Road about a 5 minute walk directly in front of the museum. You are much better off spending your money there. If the children get museum fatigue then you can take them to the science museum and go directly to the basement where there is a play area and somewhere for the parents to relax and eat. There is also a place to put your pushchairs...........Overall the museum is a good day out but you must have a plan and take plenty of refreshments with you.",Awesome
"March 6, 2009","This museum is utterly awesome. It is HUGE, my husband declared we could have easily spent two weeks in there rather than 4 hours. How anyone can NOT find something in there of interest is an absolute mystery! I have no interest in war, so I didn't go to the Imperial War Museum. I'm an environmental scientist, so I DID go to the Natural History Museum, and it's fabulous. There is a such a bredth of ground covered that there SHOULD be something for everyone, unless you go in with the wrong attitude. The only let-down was the marine invertebrate section which was woefully inadequate. Even the building is amazing and I feel probably overlooked since the exhibitions are so good! The food and cafes weren't amazing but that is not what museums are about, and since it is central London and entry is free, there's nothing to stop you going out for food then back in again. And therein was another surprise - it was totally free. Our family could have easily gone in there every day for a fortnight and it still wouldn't have cost us anything. I only wish my two young girls were as interested in it all as I was. I don't think I have every been to such a good museum, and that's not because I live regionally in Queensland, because I'm a Brit in Oz who's visited plenty of British museums etc before.Our snacks at the cafe may have been quite pricey, but the museum was free for goodness sake, and they do provide picnic spots too so there's no obligation to buy at all.",Great Architecture
"November 26, 2008","If you enjoy architecture, the Natural History Museum is wonderful, both inside and out.  It also has a nice collection of dinosaur bones, a large animatronic T-rex, and a nice collection of stuffed or replicated animals.The rest of the exhibits didn't stand out, and the museum caters to, and is generally overrun by children.  Worth a visit if you have younger kids, want to see the architecture, or just have some time to kill since it's free.",Very very busy
"August 19, 2007","Went here first Sunday in August with 3 year old+8 year old.Arrived about 12 - long queue through security, but moved quick enough. Went to dinosour exhibition just inside the door. It was packed, and took a long time to get through. Would advise anyone with a buggy to avoid. Also once you start into it, you cannot get back out except by following the crowd. It was very warm the day we were there, and we nearly passed out with the heat.We went on the Artic trip as well. Completely overpriced, would not rate at all.Rest of museum was ok, but I'd receommend for kids aged 10+, and only visit outside weekends, if you want time to inspect exhibits.",Visit a dinosaur
"June 17, 2007","We spent a very interesting day at the museum.  Our children are 8 & 5 and found alot to look at they particularly enjoyed the dinosaur section and the part in the red section about the Kobe earthquake.  We paid extra and went on the Antarctic experience which was really good fun, particularly trying on all the clothing, the coats are so heavy!! and the freezer room is interesting to try.There are plenty of places to eat and the cost isn’t too bad.  It can be very tiring walking around but there are plenty of places to sit and rest as you go around.We would thoroughly recommend a visit and are looking forward to going back again and doing all the bits we didn’t have time to do this time.",Fantastic Must go
"January 3, 2007",Spent New years day in The museaum fantastic and thats just the 1st floor. Cant wait to go back and see the rest Oh and taking all the kids next time brilliant and Free. ( but donations accepted),Great for Kids
"March 23, 2004","I took a trip to the Natural History Museum and I enjoyed it, but my friend that was with me did not! I think this place is mainly for people who enjoy doing ""kids"" stuff, there were a lot of children there so if you don't like kids - don't go! They have a great gift-shop and some of the interactive exhibits are a lot of fun. I would recommend this museum.",Wonder and Wisdom
"December 27, 2023","The Museum is a treasure trove of knowledge and fascination. From towering dinosaurs to celestial wonders, every exhibit is a journey through time. The architecture itself is awe-inspiring. A must-visit for those seeking wonder and wisdom in the heart of London.",A wonderful Christmas time
"December 24, 2023","Hadn't been in a while but we managed to catch the last sight of Dippy before he left last Christmas. We spent enough time to explore the entire thing essentially, almost every exhibit including the titanosaur which all in all took about 7 ish hours, so do be prepared to not be able to see everything! Only thing we missed was the insect area which was closed off at that time. I adore all the exhibits and the architecture of the building is lovely. That being said, the older exhibits do need some love, particularly the dinosaurs and all animal exhibits essentially that have been taxidermied. As the museum states themselves, a lot of them are quite old and faded-this in itself is okay but the problem is more in updating old information that is outdated, worn out or doesn't include vital information. A lot of the newer exhibits like the insect area are fresh and exciting which is great. Fixing a lot of the interactive activities would be great too, as well as updating the videography. ",Troy: Myth and Reality Exhibition
"January 9, 2020","As the blurb says: the legend of Troy has endured for more than 3,000 years. The exhibition explores Greek and Asian artifacts gathered during the several site excavations and artworks contemporary of the times. It is well laid out and documented, with Homer’s Iliad being the narrative theme. Quite apart from the story of a great city, plunged into a 10-year, the sculptures, paintings, pots and other stunning artifacts are amazing. The incredible Filippo Albacini sculpure, The Wounded Achilles, is worth the entrance fee alone.","No, thank you."
"December 2, 2022","No clear road to go there from Russell Square (one single board).  Just a little slate to say where the entrance is. Museum's free but it's better to have ""timed tickets"" so we made a reservation. We arrived at the opening and still had to queue under the heavy rain, on the sidewalk, the whole street long for 20 minutes. After that, we could finally go inside the museum's courtyard,  still under the heavy rain, (to wait 20-30 minutes again) to reach a marquee where our bags are checked. Then, back to the heavy rain again to walk to the ""museum's real entrance"". Couldn't the museum put on our reservation ""Warning, there will be a queue outside for security, please dress accordingly""? No tickets' checking, wonder why we took them???Lots of jewellery within the museum as many statues. The museum is worldwilde known so we had lots of expectations. Seems we had too many.The rooms' names are put on a little board put at the top right, written in a small font. Difficult to read from afar, even more if you're small. And the rooms don't have a logic. You'll pass from one to another without a direct link between them.Our visit wasn't enjoyable because of the numerous classes of students. They didn't listen to their teachers and used showcases as desk to write. They were very loud and also ran all along the museum. They also took a whole space for themselves. One or two classes is enough. Why so many? We couldn't even hear one another because of them, even though we were side by side. We also couldn't see all the items exposed because of them (showcases blinded by paper & notebooks).  The little corridors between the showcases were blocked by them so there are parts of the museum we couldn't get access to (even though we asked them to move). And they were there a lot of time, we left before they did!Shops are all over the place, felt like too many stores for one museum. The one we visited was small, the goods sold there didn't have a lot in common with the museum (""tobelerone british museum"" ok, but why  selling ""Harry Potter Wand"" from Running Press, for example). Their variety is very small. And most stuff were pricey... From our visit, we only recommend looking at the ""clocks room"", where we saw some clocks we haven't seen before, the greek temple's recreation, and that's basically it. Note: we didn't go to the exhibitions you can get access to, after paying entrance for it.We don't know if we had set our expectations too high, but it's the first time ever that we've been that disappointed after visiting a museum....",Plan  to spend most of the day
"February 2, 2020","I really love this musuem ive been 2x and still havent seen everything.If you can i recommend joining a few of the free tours offered in certain sections, the times are posted when you enter. its really interesting to not just see a sculpture and ceramic and admire, but to learn the history and culture of the time it was made.",So much stuff but only a handful of truly amazing things
"January 24, 2020",Walking through the museum you sort of get the impression that back in the day the British Museum would pay anyone and everyone for anything they could prize from its location and carry back with them from wherever it came from. There's just so much stuff and most of it is pretty similar. Sometimes you get the impression that Egypt especially must be pretty short of ancient artifacts because they are all in the British Museum. That being said the Rosetta Stone was wonderful to see and some of the Roman Statues and Greek things are pretty special.I would recommend but i'd probably point people towards the Natural History Museum as its just better.,Iconic collection of ancient treasures
"February 4, 2020","My first visit to this fabulous museum and it was definitely worth the wait.We arrived early at opening time and entered (for free!) quickly without having to queue. The place filled up very quickly after we arrived and by the time we left, the queues were out of the main gates so it’s definitely worth beating the rush.We spent hours wandering around the 90+(?) galleries of artefacts from around the world covering all of the major cultures and races from throughout history.Many of the exhibits were truly iconic and were instantly recognisable from all of the books and tv we’ve seen over the years - it was amazing to see them up close in real life. Some, such as the rosetta stone were real stars and attracted crowds of viewers whilst other “minor” exhibits weren’t as obvious but were fascinating to read about.An inspiring visit with a huge amount to see. We thought we’d seen everything but spotted several areas in the guide afterwards which we’d completely missed so there’s still more to see next time.",Incredible Exhibits
"February 28, 2020","I visited on a clear, warm, sunny weekday in January. It was almost a shame to be inside rather than outside enjoying the rare weather. I arrived at about opening time and there was not a long queue or wait to get through the security checkpoint and “ticket” counter where they ask if you would like to make a donation. I only had a few hours and wanted to look at some of the ancient stuff. I went to the Rosetta Stone, then continued through the Assyrian exhibits to the Parthenon sculptures. I went downstairs to the Greek and Roman architectural pieces then headed up to see the India exhibits. A brief look around the dying gallery and it was time to go. The museum wasn’t very busy but, some galleries and areas were mobbed with groups of Chinese or American tourists and others were empty. By the time I was leaving, the cafes and shops were full in the great court and there was a queue for the toilets. It was cool to see the actual Rosetta Stone but, it is behind glass, there used to be a full-sized copy that was displayed in the open.",Disappointing Troy
"January 4, 2020","I absoltuely love the British Museum, it's my favourite place in London, and I've visited dozens of times. However, I was sadly disappointed with the Troy exhibition for two reasons. Firstly, it was really dark inside which made reading many of the panels quite difficult. Secondly, despite choosing an allocated time slot, to control the volulme of visitors, it was extremely busy. Dodging between people's legs and bodies in order to read information in a poorly lit exhibition detracted from the level of enjoyment I was expecting. Not nearly as good as the Pompeii arrangements from a few years ago.",Troy - brilliant exhibition
"February 1, 2020","The British Museum is vast and exhausting if you do not pace yourself and be very selective.  Check out what it has to offer and select in priority order what you really want to see with some extras if you have time and stamina.  I came for the Troy exhibition. As always the exhibitions are very well curated and engaging.  This looked at myth, fact, and influence.  The story was told through found Greek pottery, sculpture, Roman frescoes; archaeological finds and modern interpretations in art and even cinema.  If you visit more than one exhibition a year it really is worth looking at membership. I did and never regretted it even though I live 200 miles form London!",Visit to the Troy exhibition 
"February 29, 2020","We visited in half term to see the Troy exhibit which was fabulous. While there we also looked through the Egyptian Halls as we had visited the Tutenkhamun exhibit the day before as well as looking through a number of the other halls. The museum is vast and you could literally spend days there. I recommend you plan what you would like to see (roughly) before you go or at least purchase a map for £2 when you enter then grab a coffee from one of the various refreshment areas and decide what to visit.  All three of the children (23,12 and 9) absolutely loved it and would have spent a second day there easily.",Just Wow!
"February 13, 2020","I’d heard a lot about The British Museum. My father had been many years previously, but I had not been in the capital for over 50 years, when I was 4. I had an itinerary for my 4 days in London, as well as a to-do list what to see in each museum. The three top items I wanted to visit were; the Rosetta Stone, Easter Islands Ho Hakananai’a statue and the Lewis Chessmen. The first two I had heard about listening to the excellent Radio 4 the World in 100 object podcasts. The Lewis Chessmen came to the fore listening to Frank Skinners excellent podcast, which got me to visit the smaller number in Edinburgh and also the site on the Isle of Lewis where they were found. I digress… The amount of arts and materials on display is mind boggling and would take days to see. My advice would be to research what you want to see and temper this with the time that you have available. The central hall which houses the café, shop, toilets etc. has the most magnificent lattice glass roof and really complements this grand old building well. Don’t forget to make a donation and use a map to plan and enhance your experience. Staff as with all of the other museums in London are first rate and deserve a mention.",Enchanting place
"March 3, 2020","We went to see the Rosetta stone and found many other wonderful things. There are so many areas with interesting artefacts that it would take several visits to see the majority of the collections. They have free tours, and entrance to the main exhibition galleries is free. However there are not enough or any disabled toilets on each level and also not enough women’s toilets, the queue was all the way up the stairs. It’s better to visit during the week, wouldn’t recommend in the weekend, it’s way too crowded.",All you ever wanted to know about English History
"May 6, 2020",The museum is an expanse of British history with multiple floors covering many acres of ground.  Entry is free though a donation of 5 pounds is requested and expected.  Roman occupation of England features prominently.  One could spend days here studying this incredible documentation.  Very informative.,Nero Exhibition August 2021
"August 20, 2021","We bought tickets for the Nero exhibition.  The online process was fast and simple.  We queued up along the street with visitors to the main (free of charge) museum but that didnt take long.  Then it was a fast trip down an empty queue lane to the place where they check your bags.So, here i was amazed.  There were staff stood behind tables and I walked up, perhaps without thinking too much and showed my ticket.  I was promptly told in a very rude tone that it was a ""bag search"".  Not ""please can i inspect your bag"".  Anyway, had i not been with my daughter I would have called this official out there and then and demanded a discussion with his manager.  So we are not off to a promising start.And so into the exhibition itself.  First, the staff were brilliant and friendly and helpful and cheerful.  This restored my faith in our trip.And so to the artifacts.  Wow - for a Rome enthusiast like me it was brilliant.  There were busts, statues, jewelry, mosaics, weapons, coins etc.  All with excellent background context.  The lighting is done to perfection, really bringing out the subtle details of this magnificent exhibition.  We finished in just over an hour and I could happily have gone round again but my daughter looked like she had seen enough and so we left.  This exhibition is brilliant for any Rome enthusiast.  Also, the stated aim is to challenge whether Nero was the ghastly creature history sees him as.  When you look at the information in the exhibition it seems far from clear cut that he was the monster described.  Indeed, plenty of indicators to the contrary.  Highly recommended.","Fantastic day out, skip the cafe"
"September 2, 2021","We visited the British Museum in August. It was easy to get to via public transport and wow, the building is SO impressive! We were wide eyed before we'd even seen any of the exhibits.Security and bag checks were nice and quick and the staff in the museum were helpful. The food in the cafe was definitely an acquired taste, and if you're visiting with children I'd advise eating before or afterwards, or bringing a picnic if allowed, because it was very expensive.Walking straight in to see the Rosetta Stone was jaw dropping, we had no idea it was there but we explained it to our 7 year old who was equally thrilled. She is history mad and was in her element wandering through the Egypt and Assyria exhibits with her camera, reading the signs to anyone who would listen.It was a shame that so many exhibits were closed, we would have loved to have seen more Greek artefacts, but it gave us time to see the brilliant Life and Death exhibit which is truly unmissable. The exhibit in the center of the room with the medication and the photographs around it is quite emotional really.The gift shop is full of very creative gifts as well as great books, perfect for history nerds like us!",Not for all
"July 1, 2020","Undoubtedly a fascinating place. However, I only recommend it to history lovers, I personally got very bored. It contains interesting finds that will surely fascinate anyone who knows about it. So I do not recommend young people who are not particularly fond of history to visit this place.There is a long line at the entrance, there are also small shops inside but the prices are not appropriate.",Intellectually stimulating
"January 9, 2020","Of all the Museums of the world with 'British' in the title, this has got to be my favourite.  Well, perhaps joint favourite with the British Concrete Museum and; The British Museum of Roundabouts BUT! let not that take anything away from this bastion of world knowledge.  Particularly impressed with the Sutton Hoo treasures; the bog man; mummies (lots of in various states); Roman finds; Greek pots; the Rosetta Stone and; the Elgin Marbles (I will leave others to argue over where they belong, but possibly worth seeing them sooner, rather then in Athens...)Drinks and food are a bit pricey!  Take your own is the best suggestion.  Perhaps the best gift shop outside of a Disney resort. Truely an excellent and informative museum with a great range of exhibits.  Certainly should be no. 1 on a list of visits whilst you're in town.",Opening End August . 
"August 10, 2020","Pretty poor really when most other attractions, historical and otherwise, have done their best to to manage Curonavirus and reopen ASAP .. this place is not re-opening until the end of August, like after the summer Hols when the kids are about to go back to school. I bet if it was a private company running Museums they would have found a safe way to open by now, after all, they have had a five month holiday .. disgraceful ",OK on the right side of security
"September 1, 2021","We did not have to book as members but getting in to the British Museum makes me grind my teeth. Hordes of security people and bag checks. What are they expecting to happen? Tate Britain survives without this level of paranoia.The Nero exhibition was satisfying for me although the perpetual gloom of such events does puzzle me. Does marble actually go off in the light? Some of the lighting did, in fact, help photography. As people recover from pandemic restrictions, the crowds were not as dense as in the past. Some would describe the exhibition merchandise as creative, others as cynically exploitative. A bath duck in legionnaires uniform? Really? Few would disagree that it is very expensive but that is consistent with similar venues.",Half term visit
"February 20, 2020","Fantastic museum but incredibly busy. The queue to get in was enormous, even at 10am and then it was difficult to see the exhibits due to the volume of people inside. Particularly distasteful was being directed to a ‘colleague’ immediately after bag checking whose job was to ask for a donation. This felt misleading and unnecessarily pressurised as there were the usual drop points for donations at the entrance.",Simply too crowded
"January 4, 2020","There was a long q to get into the museum slowed down with bag checks.  After you get in, you won’t be able to enjoy the exhibits bec of the crowds and children running around.  The worst area of congestion was understandably the Egyptian mummies.  The glass display panels were clouded with handprints as everyone wanted an up close and personal encounter with the mummies. The q for the shops was equally bad as well as the q to use the loo.  It was a crazy crowded experience which I did not enjoy at all.",Amazing Artifacts and Exhibits 
"September 28, 2021",This free museum is a must-do for any visit to London. The history found in this immense building is phenomenal and breathtaking. You will need a minimum of 2-3 hours just to see the highlights like the Rosetta Stone and Elgin Marbles and make your way thru the crowds. ,An excellent way to spend most of a day with one gripe
"January 5, 2020","I visited the British Museum whilst solo travelling in London and pretty much had an excellent time. The queuing system to get in moved very quickly and was very efficient. It had been years upon years since I last visited and I was reminded how well presented the whole museum is. Spotlessly clean, organised really well and easy to navigate. All of the galleries and exhibitions I visited were immensely enjoyable and interesting. I have to disagree with a review left down below saying it's boring for kids. I was travelling solo but I saw many families with kids having a really fun day out and clearly enjoying what they were seeing and the history. Which is always nice to see kids engaging with history.The Cafe which I visited twice was of a good quality, with friendly staff, a little on the pricey side but it's to be expected, it's London, it's the British Museum but the food and coffee was of a very good quality so wasn't as fussed. Their deal to come back in the afternoon and get a free Coffee with a cake is a very good deal too. Good thinking whoever came up with that!My only real gripe was the cost for the temporary exhibitions. I was interested to see the temporary Nero exhibition they had but was put of by the £20 price for only one temporary exhibition. It's not a case that I'm tight. I would have happily paid tenner easily and I did spend money in the gift shop and cafe. It's just £20 for one exhibition rubbed me up the wrong way a little. But otherwise all in all had a highly interesting and enjoyable couple of hours at the British Museum and glad after so long I finally visited again!",Innovative history on display
"August 4, 2021","The majority of Museums in London are free of charge on entry (V&A) with the exception of crown properties (Kensington Palace, Tower of London).  This Museum was ""renovated"" for the Milleneum with a covered space which provides a sense of a piazza which includes food options and gift shops.  Take advantage of the coat check - England has rainy weather and they do not want you dripping in the display areas.  The Parthenon Marbles (formerly referred to as the Elgin Marbles) are definitely not to be missed.  A great place to explore for several hours.","Lots of exhibits, badly organized"
"January 15, 2020","I made the mistake of visiting the british museum after the Louvre, compared to the Louvre it is messy, dull, dark, and its audio guide is useless at bestYou would have fun if you just like seeing an artifact in 10 seconds, take a picture and move on .. the museum has a ton of exhibits.But if you like to actually know the history line connecting each era then it is not very amusing, it is frustrating actually with all the randomness placing the artifacts and very little useful information in the audio guide.Also I was shocked to see many ancient treasures being displayed with no casing or protection, and little kids scratching and playing all around them. Just Imagine a very delicate statue being carved thousands of years ago travelling through time to reach this museum and a young man scratching it with his fingers carelessly to see how it feels??",Lots to see but too crowded
"February 5, 2020",We booked a slot to come on a Sunday and the initial impression was that it was very quiet. There is a one way route around the ground floor which is the only one open. There is still a lot to see - certainly half a day at least - but once we got to where the exhibits were we found it to be uncomfortably crowded and hard to maintain social distancing plus quite a few people were wandering around with masks pulled down. Lots of staff but no-one says anything.,Fascinating
"September 6, 2020","The British Museum is one of the most fascinating experiences in London. I visited the Museum on the first Friday of April for four hours in the late afternoon and early evening. The Reading Room in the center of the Museum is incredibly beautiful and historically significant; the new enclosure surrounding it is stunning. The Museum's collections are fabulous - I only saw the Roman, Roman Britain and the Medieval areas during my brief visit. You should plan to see only a small portion of the collections during your visit - plan ahead and you'll have a great time. The shops and the cafe were also very good!",Totally disappointing.
"January 23, 2020","We were absolutely gutted with disappointment from this renowned museum.After the 30-minute security queue, we entered the main hall and were immediately struck by an intense heat. It was 30 degrees outside and the museum's a/c were struggling. Bigtime!Strolling through the countless galleries, it was apparent we've arrived to what is mainly an Egyptian and Babylonian exhibition, which we found not too interesting.Shockingly enough, we gave up and left an hour later.",Maybe the most important museum in the world
"January 2, 2020","The British Museum is worth visiting for one piece alone, the Rosetta Stone. This is what unlocked the mysteries of the hieroglyphs and the world of ancient Egypt end the Pharaohs. If this piece isn't enough there is the Elgin Marbles from Parthenon in Athens. If you want more there is Cleopatras mummy. The list is long, but go see it if not only for the Rosetta Stone. The visit is free of charge, you may donate money when you get in if you want. The museum is open Friday evening, and if you go around 7PM the biggest crowds have gone for dinner. The thing that makes my grade 4/5, and not 5, is that the signs are so and so (you will find the bathrooms downstairs with entrance from the shop in the great hall, and not as arrows indicate up the stairs), that there is not the best access if you ar in a wheelchair or on crutches, and that there are sometimes just to many people to be able to enjoy the things properly.",Didn't have a game plan! 
"January 9, 2020","This is a must see as part of a London itinerary. The museum is massive and we found our selves wandering into rooms without a clear plan of what to see. Of course, the Egyptian Wing was one of our goals I am sure we missed other treasures. Easy to get overwhelmed take a few breaks and use the elevator if your feet hurt like mine. ",Overcrowded
"October 31, 2020",We went to the Tantra exhibition. They were letting people queue and enter regardless of time slot once inside it was super crowded and packed. You'd never know we are in the middle of a pandemic. It wasn't safe and we left as it was impossible to manage safe distancing. Very disappointing. The museum itself doesn't have clear one way systems eg arrows on the floor so this was adding to the general confusion,Top London attraction
"February 12, 2020","This massive museum offers much to learn, you would need days and days to see most of it. It has impressive ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece and Asian cultures collections. If you're visiting London and if you're interested in history at all it's definitely a must see.",The Quintessential British Museum
"January 3, 2020","Nearly everyone has heard of the British Museum and with good reason.  The collections are absolutely amazing.  This is the home of the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles, and one of the best collections of Egyptian artifacts outside Egypt.(Controvery over whether Britain should be the custodian of these things aside.)But that is only the beginning.  There are artifacts from all over the world: an amazing collection of Greek and Etruscan terracotta objects, Roman glass, the Sutton Hoo treasure, some of the most famous Maya stellae, beautiful torquoise mosaic objects of the Aztec culture; sections devoted to China, Japan, and the South Pacific.  A serindipity of German ""notgeld"".  And much more!One of the most wonderful areas is King George Library, the ""Enlightenment Room"": one could spend an entire day just there!That being said, one has to be prepared for crowds, particularly at popular exhibits like the Egyptian artifacts and King George Library.  During the week there are numerous school groups clogging these areas and multiple tours in a variety of languages.  One has to be patient: go see something 'unpopular' at peak times and try the popular things later.  We actually saw the Rosetta Stone at one point with not another soul around.  It helps to have several hours to devote here.",Troy exhibition
"February 17, 2020","I was a bit apprehensive about taking my partner and friend to see the exhibition. I was educated with regards to classical Greece and have read the Iliad and Odyssey. They had little prior knowledge of either. However they thoroughly enjoyed it and were probably did so more than me as it was all so new to them. On one of the worst days of the year so far, we happily spent 7 hours in the museum and were quite disappointed when closing time came.",Decided to meet up with family in the restaurant on the third floor
"January 19, 2020",We decided to meet up with 4 of my wife's cousin who we hadn't seen for over 10 yeas and the British museum was a great choice. We eat in the third floor circle restaurant and what a great choice. The food and service was First Class so would'nt hesitate to recommend.,What a superb place - and the best attraction catering in London!
"January 17, 2020","The museum itself is incredible. The architecture, exhibits and interpretation all superb. And so spacious it never feels crowded. However, with a dd who can't have  dairy or soy, eating out is tough. This was the first and only place of many we visited that properly understood, catered with something delicious, and didn't make her sick. Both the pizzeria and the courtyard cafe were superb, and the pizzeria's food was both the tastiest, and the cheapest wholesome, healthy and delicious meal we've had in our time in London. Troy exhibition was also superb. Can't wait to return.",4000BC and all that
"October 2, 2020",Good to see that the British Museum has reopened after the Covid19 lockdown.  You need to pre book a ticket-easy as website works smoothlyTake care to arrive at the allocated time- then entry is smooth and easy. Only the ground floor open and a signposted route to follow. It makes one reflect on current pandemic challenges when faced with the statues from Egypt dating back to 4000 BC.  The details given are worth reading.  Also before visiting the Museum worth taking time to follow one of the British Museum video tours shown on YouTube.  The curators are expert at explaining the pieces  and giving relevant background.The whole tour is in line with best Covid guidelinesIt takes about 2-3 hours to complete.,Huge Museum but non is related to British History !!??
"February 9, 2020","it's a bite weird that all things in the museum were history of other countries (e.g. China, Egypt...etc) but non of them is related to British!!   Anyways, Museum is huge, it may takes you 4-5 hours to go through everything if you are interested.  Be spare more time when you are going to British Museum",Great museum
"August 11, 2021",We visited the museum on a Sunday afternoon in August and although we booked online we had to queue which seemed daft. You have your bags checked and wheeled luggage isn't permitted into the museum. The museum is huge and so impressive from the moment you step in. You could spend the day here and still not see everything. We only visited the general exhibitions but there are other exhibits which you can pay for.,Fantastic afternoon tea in the grand court
"June 18, 2022",Had a wonderful afternoon tea plus Prosecco at the Grand Court with my friends. The sandwiches were fresh and quite filling. We didn’t manage to finish all the desserts.Very relaxed atmosphere and friendly service.Recommend booking beforehand- we booked just two days beforehand for Saturday at 1 pm.It was reasonably priced.,One of London’s Treasures
"February 15, 2020","The British museum is a must see when you are in London. We visited on the weekend, while there was an Achilles exhibit that was being challenged. Demonstrators were everywhere in the museum to boycott BP who was sponsoring the exhibit. Was able to see the Rosetta Stone, which was a big reason we went to the museum. Overall, it was a great experience and truly enlightening to see everything that was showcased in the British Museum.","Amazing, gigantic museum!"
"April 19, 2022","There is just so much to explore at the British Museum! I recommend you spend a full day there (arrive early to avoid queues). Still you'll need to pick your favourite sections as the museum is so vast. I particularly recommended exploring the Egyptian section (Rosetta Stone, pharaohs' statues) and the Middle East section (Iran, Assyrian sphinx statues, etc.). Also check out the Lewis Chess set and the Greek section (Partheon and the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus). Every culture and era is represented with the most beautiful and fascinating items and statues!",Needs a couple of visits
"October 12, 2022",There is so much to see at that I strongly recommend a couple of visits to the museum. After a few hours the brain starts to become overwhelmed with information and visual stimulation...Greatly enjoyed the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles. (we later visited the Acropolis Museum in Athens to see the rest)Focused on early Greek and Roman exhibits and were not disappointed. Outstanding.,Excellent visit.
"February 8, 2020",Came on quick trip to London to visit Troy exhibition at British Museum. It was worth the trip.  Excellent exhibition which meant a lot to both of us firstly because we have visited the ancient site of Troy and  some sites in Greece associated with this period also because my husband is a classics student and has always been interested in this area of ancient history.  This was a very well put together exhibition with lots of exhibits.  We always visit the museum when we come to London always something to see whether or not there are exhibitions on. Great gift and bookshops also.,Sharing culture with a colleague 
"February 1, 2020","I had my operations director fly in from India for a review meeting and rather then share the delights of a rented office, I decided to hold our meeting at the British Museum while looking at the amazing artefacts. We walked the main galleries which are stunning and we had a very successful meeting.The artefacts really demonstrate the ingenuity of human kind and are humbling.",One of the world's must see museums
"August 21, 2022","This is a large museum and can seem overwhelming. The staff is excellent and will always help with suggestions and directions. The gift shop and bookstore are excellent. Entry is free, but most visitors leave 5 pounds or such as a donation. To see all of the museum, plan two or three visits.",Always a pleasure
"March 5, 2020","Quick call in on way back to train after an overnight stay. No matter how many times you go, there is always something new to see and the quiet within the museum is always a joy away from the hubbub of the city. Could always spend more time here",Amazing collection and free to enter
"February 1, 2020","I took a 14-year old child who found the mummies and Elgin Marbles very impressive.  The majority of galleries open at 10am, although you can gain access to the building before that.  The covered atrium is a feat of modern engineering.  There is good interpretation","A Magnificent Collection of Mummies, Antiquities and Art"
"November 28, 2021",The British Museum can easily hold its own with Le Louvre and the Smithsonians when it comes to ancient artifacts and history.  The Egyptology section is overwhelming in its presentation of mummies and items that date to the time of the Pharoahs.  The displays are informative and endlessly fascinating.The depth of the museum is impressive and easily worth a multi-day trip.,More than worth while - if you take your time
"September 27, 2022","After several trips to London this was our first time at the British Museum - and definitely not our last. As with other major and leading museums across the globe you either need to schedule several hours for your visit - or focus on specific parts of the exhibition. With around eight million objects, the number of items and antiquities from all eras of human history is mind-blowing, with the highlights certainly being the collection of Egyptian mummies and the Rosetta Stone. A personal highlight were the The Africa Galleries. Definitely worth more than one (two, three) visits for everyone vaguely interested in mankind's history and culture.",A tour around the world in 90 minutes
"February 12, 2020",I had already visited the Museum a long time ago. This guided tour was an opportunity to review the marvels that the British Museum has to show us and also the new additions in terms of building and exhibits. An excellent guide.A wonderful Museum ti visit again and again.,Sheep herding
"August 6, 2023","When visiting the very expensive side exhibitions of say the Sainsbury gallery it is advisable to get there with more than 2 hours to spare. Otherwise they literally kick you out before you’ve finished enjoying the exhibits. Honestly, it was like being kicked out of the boozer at closing time. Terrible experience. The staff need a talking to. Horrible","Not that many tourists, a great time for visiting now"
"October 16, 2021","Over 13 million items representing the cultures of the world, ancient and modern. it is advisable to have a list of specific sections of the museum that you want to see otherwise it gets overwhelming and your feet get very tired.  We picked the Egyptian mummies (missed them in Cairo) and Hoards of gold, silver etc found in UK.  The stories behind the discovered Hoardes within UK were amazing! Sutton Hoo, Thetford, Hoxne and the Lynx. We also stopped at the clock gallery because we have a relative that is obsessed with clocks, so we took a lot of videos and pictures. The clocks are set to different times, so they do NOT chime all at the same time. Amazing selection! All eating places are closed except the café by the bookstore that has a selection of sandwiches, croissants, sweets and hot beverages.Self-serve only, and there was plenty of seating available as that were not that many tourists visiting.",Disappointing
"January 6, 2020","Disappointing, it was not what I expected. I have wanted to go for over 40 years and finally got here. It was packed with people, the toilets were smelly and we had to wait in line for 10 minutes, not enough seats if you wanted to sit and have a coffee. Yes teh exhibits were great, but most of the amenities also belonged in a museum.",World cultural icon badly let down by poor entrance experience
"April 2, 2023","We booked a 90min spotlight tour and arrived 15min before the scheduled 11:30am yesterday. Upon arrival we were confronted with three different queues, two of which were long snaking ones marked “All Visitors” and “Timed Entry Tickets”.Anxious to arrive on time for the tour, we approach the usher to enquire about the location of the meeting spot for the tour. With complete indifference and a miserable attitude, she pointed towards the “All visitors” queue with a sweeping gesture. We stood in the queue for a few minutes and unconvinced  that she has even given any consideration to our question, we switched over to the “timed entry ticket” queue which to us made a bit more sense. Having committed without conviction that we are in right queue and resigned that we might actually missed our tour, we arrived finally at the bag check area to find to our consternation that the TWO queues which have caused much confusion at the entrance MERGED INTO ONE anyway! I have to state that this bewilderment was shared by many frustrated visitors in the queue.It is very disappointing that a world cultural icon like the British museum which receives over six million people around the world annually is not able to put in place a more sensible queue system and a polite welcome that the Brits are famous for.",Museum you MUST visit
"August 29, 2020","British Museum needs no introduction. Certainly one of the best attractions in London and a must-see for everyone. Basically, one can describe the British Museum as a museum of the history of mankind. The expositions show artefacts from different parts of the world (Europe, Asia, Africa, America) and different times (large part from the ancient time, but also from middle-ages or even XVIII century) and have no weak point. And if we're talking about the exhibitions, especially impressive are those with items from ancient Egypt, Rome and Mesopotamia. The artefacts from medieval Europe and pre-Columbian America are another part worth seeing.  Honestly, I could mention every part of the museum here. Simply, go and see yourself (and be prepared to spend there entire day).",Busy but thrilling
"January 8, 2020","What can you do except wish you had more time at this place! Loved the huge indigenous peoples exhibit, the large libraries full of Greek sculptures and the beautiful Chinese vases, tapestries and artifacts. It’s a stunning amount of stories to take in. The cafes have a few decent vegan snacks and good teas. The gift shops are also quite fun! Bonus - staff were quite friendly! Plan your visit, give yourself time to make your way through the crowds and enjoy the experience.",Well worth the visit
"February 28, 2020",I had always wanted to see the British Museum and on our recent trip to London we made a point of visiting. The exhibits are all arranged very well and we enjoyed the time very much. The highlights were the Rosetta Stone and the Platypus. You can actually see the marks where they tried to pry the beak off when it was first sent from Australia.,Good 1-2 hour activity
"June 9, 2023","Interesting museum! The Egypt exhibits were the most interesting and are a must see. It’s nice that the museum is free, but do not bring kids if you don’t like constant complaining and want to stay for longer than an hour!! It’s also pretty crowded, but there are always some less crowded rooms. ",A place to visit 
"February 22, 2020","Wonderful experience...Hundreds of people visiting one of the most well known Museums in the world. A huge journey in the history, life, culture and civilisation of so many countries in the world. Surely a memorable destination. ",Brilliant Location and Superb Building
"October 17, 2022","We came here to attend an evening function downstairs at The British Museum held by the British Horror Film Academy Festival. What a truly superb venue and such an excellent atmosphere. The all-ticket event was incredible, and the capacity audience watched 5 short horror films followed by the feature horror film ""Feed Me"". All the films were just simply brilliant, and we loved them all. At the end of the evening, they did all the annual awards ceremony and the film ""Feed Me"" took 5 awards which was truly amazing including our son who took the Best Actor Award for 2022. We would highly recommend a visit to this excellent location and would encourage others to consider using the wonderful facilities and screen area within.",Poorly organized and over-crowded
"August 7, 2022","The collections are of course stunning. But the lay-out of the rooms makes no sense, neither chronologically nor geographically. The maps are hard to follow, and the crowds were intense. We signed-up for an entry time, as they do care about minimizing crowds. But they let far too many people in at once, and the experience was kind of disorienting and stifling.",Great museum but could be more user friendly
"August 22, 2021","An unwelcoming start as the staff checking bags seemed fed up and rude.  We also had a timed ticket and moved in a slow queue in comparison to the people who hadn't got tickets.Headed first to the Nero exhibition - which as very good.  It was a little busy but there were options to read the material on your phone to reduce crowded.  It was well presented with clear information for different audiences.  I didn't know much before so found it informative.After coffee (good if pricey), we tried the audio tour from the website.  However, they have removed all the paper maps and that there was no easy way to find the objects on the tour.  I asked a member of staff and they weren't able to to help either.  I appreciate they have had to remove the audio tours and maps - however - they need to be replaced by something.Other places (eg Tate and National Gallery) seem better organised and an altogether smoother, more encouraging experience as we move to a different phase of Covid response.","Amazing museum for Egyptian, Greek and Roman artifacts."
"June 13, 2022","Spent an entire day here(10:30-5pm)! So much to see and very well organized. Lots of extremely friendly and helpful staff. Had lunch here and everything was fresh and tasty. Went to the special exhibit on Feminine Power which was pretty interesting. Artifacts pulled from the main part of the museum and displayed together with different historians commentary as well as descriptions of each artifact. The museum is free, special exhibits are not but I felt it was worth the price because it was well thought out and displayed. The free tours, provided by volunteers, were great! Caught a few in the different galleries and was very impressed. You have to book a time to enter the museum and special exhibits. Arrived at the museum to a huge line( que) and did panic but no one even checked our booking for the museum. Bag checks are required and staff was very efficient and friendly. Signage to special exhibit was lacking but lots of staff around to ask for directions. A short walk from the subway ( tube) very pretty area too.",Chilly visit to artefacts
"February 19, 2020","We visited British Museum on 18.2.2020.We enjoyed our visit a lot. We downloaded, printed and marked parts of museum we wanted to see and it was great idea. Because museum is simply huge. We had very pleasant time and spent there a bit over 4h, including lunch at Pizzeria (btw excellent pizza!).It was just strange that pizza smell was noticeable even in one of the exhibition rooms. But it worked well and we are happy we went for the pizza.We must admit we were both very surprised how cold it was in the museum. I thought jeans and t-shirt would be enough. But half way through our visit, we had to go back to cloak room, to pick up my hoodie, because it was unbearably cold. Did not happen to us in any other museum though. But we do understand that since there are big pieces of various artefacts on walls, there is just zero space for heating. So before you go check which parts of exhibition you want to see and keep in mind it gets a bit chilly :)",A fascinating experience
"August 2, 2021",We decided to have a day at the museums in London. We planned on visiting 3 or 4 but only got round to 2 because of the sheer scale of the British Museum. It's a fascinating place with so much history and artifacts. Definitely go in with an open schedule as you may end up doing what we did and losing track of time. We'll definitely be back!,Easy and impressive
"March 13, 2022","I read a lot of reviews before going and was concerned it would be too busy or the queue to get inside would be really long. We visited on a Saturday and arrived at about 14.00. There was no queue to get inside, the bag check was quick and easy, no one asked to see a ticket or to make a donation (there are boxes throughout the museum to donate in cash.) My only complaint is that there is so much to see and you can't possibly see it all in a day. It wasn't too busy and people were respectful so if there's a crowd gathered around an artefact just stand in place gradually moving forward for less than a minute and you'll get to the front. We didn't eat so I can't comment on the food.",Stunining Museum Collections
"January 29, 2020",Extraordinary collections of art from all over the world. Historical parts are breathtaking. The Queen's library was one of my favorites spots to visit. It is a museum that needs several visits to accomplish great discories.,Sheep herding
"August 6, 2023","When visiting the very expensive side exhibitions of say the Sainsbury gallery it is advisable to get there with more than 2 hours to spare. Otherwise they literally kick you out before you’ve finished enjoying the exhibits. Honestly, it was like being kicked out of the boozer at closing time. Terrible experience. The staff need a talking to. Horrible","Not that many tourists, a great time for visiting now"
"October 16, 2021","Over 13 million items representing the cultures of the world, ancient and modern. it is advisable to have a list of specific sections of the museum that you want to see otherwise it gets overwhelming and your feet get very tired.  We picked the Egyptian mummies (missed them in Cairo) and Hoards of gold, silver etc found in UK.  The stories behind the discovered Hoardes within UK were amazing! Sutton Hoo, Thetford, Hoxne and the Lynx. We also stopped at the clock gallery because we have a relative that is obsessed with clocks, so we took a lot of videos and pictures.

It was packed with people, the toilets were smelly and we had to wait in line for 10 minutes, not enough seats if you wanted to sit and have a coffee. Yes teh exhibits were great, but most of the amenities also belonged in a museum.",Hot and hectic
"July 5, 2023",Possibly our fault but we didn't expect the museum to be rammed on a rainy Tuesday in early July. We had to queue a while to get in and once inside was absolutely heaving. Had no chance of getting near the Rosetta Stone and getting bodily barged out of the way in the mummies display was a highlight!One of our party felt faint from the heat and had to go outside to cool off - this was particularly noticeable on the upper floors. We'd spent several hundred pounds getting to London and we left feeling very deflated and somewhat moist!,Not all open
"August 31, 2020","Love this place but a great deal of it it is not yet open. No mummies, the asias or english portions open, some parts of greek ect not available.not worth the long journey to see half the museum minus some of the best artifacts ",I could die here.
"January 4, 2020","I'm not kidding. I love the British Museum. I could die happily in any of those galleries. The Egyptian, Sumerian, Greek, Indian, Chinese, and Roman exhibitions are second to none. Only could the greatest empire in human history collect the greatest artifacts and relics from all over the world to display, for free, in a building that is worthy of the collection. Fantastic place to see real history from all over the world.",The history of the work under one roof
"October 6, 2020","This is one of the greatest museums the world. Its exhibits are all wonderful and it is well laid out. It has a number of iconic exhibits including the Rosetta Stone which is the first thing you see, and the frieze from the Parthenon. Its collection of artifacts from Ancient Egypt are particularly stunning. Access is limited just now, presumably due to Covid, but there is still plenty to absorb you for a couple of hours anyway. It is one of the ""must see"" places in London so you really must see it!",Astounding amount of history!
"April 25, 2022","We took a trip to London, ended up getting a hotel in Holborn, which was just two blocks from the British Museum. So it was super convenient and something we would have gone out of our way for anyway.The line outside was long but it moved quickly and efficiently. Notably security was not only productive but genuinely charming. The entrance was just stunning, the staircases and the rotunda genuinely gave us pause. The sheer depth of how much stuff was here was also intimidating. We had to get a map and actually figure out our plan of attack.For me the Egyptian exhibits were the highlights but literally every historical period and geographic area had amazing exhibits. I love weapons and they had them in spades, from primitive clubs to gorgeous inlaid swords.My only reservations were twofold. 1st, apparently every school in London brought their kids and they swarmed the place like locusts. I though British kids were a lot more civilized than Americans but not these ones!The other small reservation is that there are some exhibits that you have to pay extra to see. In this case it was Stonehenge. As we were going to the real thing I was okay but for the token price it would have been worth it.All in all, these small reservations did nothing to deflate the experience. I would go back again and spend another full day there!",Fantastic Museum
"October 17, 2022","I love the British Museum, especially the Egyptian Section. It is quiet and the rooms are very well organised. It is free so accessible to anyone which I think it is amazing for families and all people. If you want to support it you can easily make a donation. The queue looks long, but it is very fast so it takes only few minutes to access the museum itself. Booking is required even if free.",The British Museum visit
"January 4, 2020",The building itself is magnificent and galleries spacious so even when busy it is ok to walk with many.I wanted to visit to see the Egypt gallery as I have recently been at the Saatchi gallery to see the Tutankhamun exhibition.I was very disappointed to find two of the main rooms containing artefacts closed to the public until further notice(No date for reopening).The very least the Museum could do is advise on the website what is available and works that are taking place with restrictive accessThe artefacts that were on show were really good but I left a little flat and slightly annoyed.This is somebody who lives in London who can come back anytime so I feel for many of our foreign visitorsAnother annoying thing is the tour guides who seem to be both official and unofficial .Apart from my little issues I had a great time and I will be back to see the rest.,The most authorative museum in the world.
"January 18, 2020","This museum is the model for the Museums of the World with the widest spead of departments, and is the go to start if wishing to learn about any historical artefact anywhere.  I have recently visited its stunning exhibition about Troy, and I wish I had all the information on the exhibition before visiting the actual site which itself was rather disappointing in contrast to the fascinating museum display. Manyof the exhibits, especially the tomb carvings of the stories brought the myths to life so that it was possible to imagine what must have happened to cause the stories to be written.     ",Large Cultural Museum - FREE Admission 
"August 6, 2022","Cultural Museum with FREE Admission in London. Tickets can be reserved on line, but nobody even asked to see our  🎟 for admission. You can easily spend all day here! If you go in the summer ☀️ like we did, be aware that many of the rooms can be hot. The museum is very popular, so is quite crowded. There is SO much to see, it takes a minimum of 2.5 hours to go through exhibits quickly. ",Great Museum
"July 5, 2022","This is a must visit place when you in London.  The entrance of this museum is amazing, so many collections, and well displayed.The gift shops are wonderful, you get 10% off of your next purchase, so buy item one by one.Best of all the museum is free to entry, even it is free, you are treated as paid visitors, the workers are friendly and helpful, which gave a very good impression of my first visit to London.",Endlessly fascinating museum
"March 27, 2023",Entry to the British Museum is free so you don't need to spend all day - you can come back another time. I visited many times when I lived in London and have been back on many return trips to London. This time we spent just an hour and looked at some Ancient Egyptian objects and some artefacts from the so-called Dark Ages. There is plenty for future visits! The back entrance is much less busy than the main one. Worth remembering when it is raining.,Quick visit having previously worked at the Museum
"February 14, 2020",Just popped in as worked at the Museum many years ago.  It’s an amazing place still. It’s great it’s still a free Museum and open to everyone.  Having visited several Museums in Europe it was noticeable that I didn’t see any labels to the artefacts in French or German they were just in English.  Worth visiting even if you only have an hour to spare.  ,Head to the Japanese room
"February 15, 2020","Fabulous building with amazing exhibits.  This time I visited the Japanese room which is one of the more remote areas of the museum, but worth the trip up the stairs.  One of the star pieces is a suit of Samurai armour which is so intricate and beautiful. ",It’s free and it’s great
"November 11, 2021","I was slightly over faced by the amount of impressive exhibits in the museum and have resolved to come back when I have more time to explore properly. Enjoyed the Lewis Chessmen (gallery 40) and the Rosetta Stone, plus the Egyptian mummies. Would suggest focusing on a few galleries rather than wandering aimlessly as we did! Clock room wasn’t operational so had to carry our coats which was a pain. Estimate 50% of guests were wearing masks.",Impressive Collection
"March 9, 2020","We visited here last week on our impromptu trip to London.  It has free entry which is brilliant and a vast array of collections from all around the world, with the highlight undoubtedly being the Mummies of Egypt. They are marvelous and seeing the remains so well preserved, along with the mummy of Cleopatra, it is a must see!It was exceptionally busy in the Mummies section but other than that it was brill. The foyer itself is awe inspiring, and really takes you back in terms of an architecture perspective!",Wonderful to see these priceless artefacts 
"March 5, 2020","I never fail to be in awe of the workmanship of these huge carved artworks from 2,000+ years ago. The Hall with Ancient Greek reliefs at one end and Asyrian gates still the other with Egyptian statues set out wonderfully through the centre. What’s not to love. We are so privileged to have these to see for free in our city.",A must-see London attraction.
"August 10, 2021","I'm sire many other reviewers have discussed the merits of the museum exhibits so I just wanted to add a quick note about accessibility.  The museum offers wheelchairs to people with disabilities.  Their website asks for people to reserve in advance, but due to poor planning on our part, we didn't get it done.  No worries though.  The staff was able to provide one for my wife, who walks with a cane.  Because of this kind gesture she was able to enjoy a much longer and more thorough visit than she normally would have done.  So glad they have thought of this.",Go with a plan of what you want to see
"May 12, 2022","So much to see and most artifacts are from Foreign countries so not sure why it's called the British Museum. I would recommend going with a plan otherwise you'll end up walking around aimlessly like I did. Found some very interesting things to look at. I found the creation of money from the beginning to now, particularly good",Brilliant and free
"March 2, 2020","I have been here several times over the years. There is a vast range of artifacts ranging from pre history to modern day.Considering this museum is free it's fantastic, They could charge and it would be totally fair. This place is educational for everyone and certainly shouldn't be missed.",Choose your exhibits
"January 18, 2020",You could spend days there as there is so much information artifacts and pieces of history. Lots to see and read and amazing insights in the past. Always busy and its free except certain special exhibits  ,Impressive Collection Worth the Visit.
"February 4, 2020",The British Museum is very impressive with its vast collection if antiquities and artifacts dating back to thousand years BC.  The layout is systematic and organized in a way that you do not feel as crowded as with the visiting the Louvre. We thoroughly enjoy our visit.,Great museum 
"February 20, 2020",It's a great museum. It's a bit sad though the fact that so many great art pieces and sculptures from other countries are being displayed at this museum and not their place of origin. Watch it is almost always very busy! ,Great museum
"October 26, 2023","This is a fabulous if overwhelming museum. The tickets are free but we made a timed entry reservation in advance for the earliest slot. When we arrived, the queue was around the block, but it moved fast once doors opened. We followed the 1-hour ""highlights"" tour found on the museum website. It was a good way to see a good portion of the museum as we walked through while keeping somewhat of a focus, as you could easily spend 3 days here. They also have an extensive gift shop. Definitely worth a visit!",A must for all who visit London
"October 3, 2021","The British Museum is a must for anyone who visits London. The collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, amongst others, is amazing. Unfortunately we were unable to see the Parthenon Frieze as it was being remodeled. The museum was pretty empty due to COVID so we could finally see everything without hoards of people. The timed tickets also help with this. One room that you do not want to miss is the Clock Room - go at the top of the hour so you can hear all of the clocks chime at once. Though it is the British Museum, the museum is not British history but what the British brought back from travels/expeditions around the world.",History on a plate 
"February 10, 2020","Yet another must-see museum in London. It never fails to impress or teach me something new. It has some controversial items, such as Elgin Marbles, that are claimed by their countries of origin so not easy to have a clear moral standpoint but still not a reason to prevent you from seeing this excellent collection of human achievements throughout history. ",Not everything accessible
"October 29, 2020",We pre booked our ticket online and walked in without waiting.  It was great to be able to see things without the usual scrum but I was really disappointed at the large amount of galleries that weren't accessible at the moment - but understand the guidelines have to be followed.  Only 1 set of toilets were open which meant a lengthy queue.  Could the museum ask some of its staff to be more friendly - the young man doing the bag searches was mono syllabic at best and some of the others inside weren't much better.  But - we enjoyed our visit and well done to the museum for what they are doing in difficult circumstances.,Great museum
"March 3, 2020",A wonderful museum with fantastic treasures. Best to plan a visit and focus on particular areas - including some of the smaller quieter rooms with specialist collections. Avoid wet days - it gets very busy.,A classical museum
"February 17, 2020",The British museum is a must seen in London. It houses very important artefacts showing the genius of mankind numerous civilisations. The little downside in my opinion would be a too classical approach to museology. It sometimes lacks the more immersive and interactive experience of other museums of London.,Awe-inspiring.
"March 12, 2023","This is a huge museum, of which only a tiny part can be seen on any one visit.The permanent collections are magnificent and like other similar institutions there is a rolling programme of temporary exhibitions, some of which are charged for (the museum itself has free entry).I recently visited specifically for the superb ‘Hieroglyphs’ exhibition, and come here about 4 times a year. I wish I could visit every week; it’s one of the World’s great museums and should be first on the list for any visitor to London interested in human history and culture.",Something for everyone
"February 14, 2020","Many,  perhaps most, of its exhibits do not concern Britain.  It is a museum built to help the British, and visitors, learn about all sorts of things.  I had hoped for more exhibits on ancient Britain, but was pleased with the exhibits on ancient Rome, ancient Greece,  and China.   ","Beautiful, must see museum!"
"December 30, 2020",I went before we had tier 4 in London and I felt incredibly safe and socially distanced. The artefacts in each room were just breathtaking and take you through many different civilisations. The entrance is just beautiful! For any history lover I advise that this is the museum you see if you visit London. As a Londoner I'm super surprised to took me so long to come and see it for myself. The Egyptian artefacts in particular are beautiful. A must see in London!,One of the best historcial museums in the world
"January 3, 2020","Firstly, it's free. But please contribute towards its maintenance as they have assembled some of the most extensive pieces of ancient history I have ever seen. The Rosetta Stone is of course the pride of this museum but if you like ancient Egyptian, Assyrian even Chinese jade history, this is the place for you. For a first timer, you can probably cover it in 4-5 hours with some amount of reading. But if you really want to dig deep, the fact that it is free means you can do a couple of half days and really absorb these fragments of the ancient world. The museum is also family friendly with enough toilets located at the main hall.",Excellent day out
"March 5, 2020","We walked to the museum from Kensington which took about 15 minutes. We entered the museum from the entrance opposite the science museum as it was less busy. There were massive queues at the main entrance which surprised us. We managed to get in after about 15 minutes which was pretty good. The museum was interesting, well signposted inside with plenty of areas to eat and drink. My young daughter was fascinated by the main hallway as it was the scene of the Children’s BBC series Andy’s dinosaur adventures.   ","Fabulous treasures in an uninspiring, boring setting"
"March 16, 2022","I visited here yesterday and was excited about seeing the Sutton Hoo treasures.  However, when I found the room where these magnificent historical finds were displayed, I was disappointed in the boring and uninspiring layout.  In fact, the whole museum was uninspiring and certainly the whole venue could make more effort in bringing fabulous treasures to life.  For example, more visuals to show how the area of Sutton Hoo might have looked in Anglo Saxon times.  Information about how the burial ship made it to its final resting place.  I wandered around a couple of other rooms and then left feeling that this has to be the most un-interactive museum I have visited.  I'm going to Sutton Hoo this summer (Suffolk) and hope the National Trust have made a better job of telling the story than has been done at the British Museum.",Don't let the line to get in scare you away
"December 12, 2023","In all fairness, I should have read a review or two before arriving at the British Museum. I signed up for a free timed ticket online on the museums website as directed. They state that they suggest the timed entry tickets, but they do hold some time slots for people who show up without tickets. I was shocked to see the very long line…. All the way down the front of the block and more than half way around the corner of the side of the block. This line is for everyone, ticket holders and those without a timed QR code alike. The people in front and behind me did not have tickets and everyone got in. This was at 11:00 am, maybe later in the day it is different. The line moves somewhat quickly. If you don’t have a bag you can get through faster. You go through metal detector and then you are allowed entry into the museum. No one looks at your QR code, ever.  A guidebook/map can be found near the entry— suggested 5 euro donation, but they do not have change. If you want to see the Rosetta Stone go left once you enter into the museum —it’s on the ground floor. There are plenty of toilets throughout the museum. The employees are very kind and happy to give you directions to wherever you are trying to go.  Overall, a very nice museum.",Quite disapointed
"January 25, 2020",May be I had too much expectations...You will have much more nice greek statues to see in the National Archeologic museum of Naples as well as Egyptian antiquities.I liked  the renaissance and the Mesopotamia department  On the first floor I found a very interesting.,Must see and appreciate
"July 3, 2021","Had a short wander around on a Friday afternoon. I've been a few times before and still took two hours so recommend you schedule in time. If you're bringing children, I imagine hard to maintain interest in all the collections. Covid managed very well, I actually quite like the one way system to help manage your way round :-) The amazing items and history here is phenomenal and whilst still arguably this isn't their home(s) I think it is really important these artefacts are valued and appreciated whilst they are here - and I think the British Museum do a good job of that as well as providing context. I think some context in some areas needs to be  updated to better reflect our knowledge of history today but there are signs to reflect that too. ",amazing collection
"May 15, 2020","when you walk in, you notice the light change and this massive column holding up a really cool glass ceiling. feels like a spaceship in some ways, even though the outside is serious and robust. a treat!",Old is Gold
"June 22, 2021","Where do I even begin?! I mean, it's all just so incredibly amazing. Not only is this museum one of the hugest that I've ever seen before, it's also FREE to visit and filled with so many stunning art pieces. No wonder it's one of the world's most visited museums!",A huge overpriced disappointment
"March 2, 2022","World of Stonehenge. My birthday, venture out of covid world to the BM for a treat.  The exhibition room was packed, made us feel very uncomfortable and exposed. We wear masks in public places, we know it’s not obligatory but still…the BM appeared to be making up for lost revenue by packing ‘em in. Not good. I have commented on previous exhibitions about lack of seating and small fonts on explanations. Nothing changes with the BM, it appears. So if you are a bit crumbly and / or visual impairment you are not going to enjoy this. The poor signage means that people occupy space trying to read stuff that if in larger font would make life easier and transit faster.We expected an exhibition largely about Stonehenge…it was just about everything but Stonehenge. It had lots of lovely artefacts from northern and Western Europe but very little that was from the Stonehenge area. We expected construction, phases, timelines, possible uses, local populations, the speculated rituals etc etc. Very disappointed and highly unimpressed with the BM management consideration of disability needs. We left early.",Free general entry
"June 29, 2021",Quite simply the biggest & most interesting collection of artefacts from around the world making its name somewhat ironic. It’s far from a museum of British history rather a fine art collection of British collectors. It’s not actually that inspiring or even exciting and I could understand why the hordes of primary school children looked completely bored out of their little minds! It is just room after room of set exhibits after all with no interactive elementsZ After a while the exhibits look the same which is a reflection of how alike human civilisations of the past were and how we have  more in common than not today irrespective of where the exhibit originated from. You can spend hours upon hours here reading all the exhibits and listening to the audio information or you can whizz round in just over an hour as we did and still receive a feast for the eyes.,"Great museum, amazing exhibitions however train the waiters better, please."
"December 18, 2022","We had so much fun walking though the exhibition even if you keep your coat on, in wintertime as it is, do to the temperatures they need to have, really chilly in certain parts of the museum e.g. Mummy/ ancient Egypt. Visit well worth alone for the amount of things you can and will see as you visit it.However, we felt sorry for the staff at the pizzeria - the food is great and a clear recommendation and at a price point where you say - not that much higher in comparison to the restaurans around, however they needs to be better coordinated in terms of responsibility and knowing what the actually do.",It’s free! Worth a visit
"February 16, 2020","Last time I came here was on a school trip some 30 years ago, so it’s changed a lot in that time.Depending on what you’re interested in you could spend hours looking around.The more general interest exhibits (think Egyptian mummies) can get very busy, so be aware there will be lines.",Colossal Museum Best Seen When one has limited time
"April 9, 2020","The British Museum is one of, if not the best museum in the world. I have the opportunity to visit only two hours to spare. This was just perfect for me and helped me narrow my areas of interest. It has vast ancient Egypt galleries and Hellenic works of art which always peaks my interest. Plenty of areas to stop for a quick bite perfect to keep moving. To have anything more in the way time, one would be tempted to spend eternity there. ",A storehouse of information
"March 22, 2020","Went over to the museum to look for literature on a specialised area of philately. The staff were helpful in exploring my area of focus and providing me with the books required to further my knowledge base. What was interesting was that I could scan material and email it to myself without any charge. Quite impressed with the amount of information that is available, if you know what to look for, with helpful staff to point you to what to look for.",Well organised and seeing some treasures anew
"September 30, 2020","The British Museum is a true Treasure Trove of objects which we have visited on a number of occasions, always seeing something new, and concentrating on certain areas because it would be overkill to see too much in a day. In London for a couple of days, we booked a lockdown visit. A special one way trail on the main floor has been devised which takes you through many of the highlights and as always, opened our eyes to items scarcely seen before. Well done the BM, a treat.",Astounding collection of ancient history
"February 29, 2020",Avoiding the ethical debates that occur surrounding some of the artifacts contained here. My daughter is studying the ancient Egyptians this term and ancient Greece next so we decided to bring her to look at the corresponding exhibits.Visiting on a Saturday we expected queues to get in however entering via Russell Square side entrance we had no issues at all and quickly made our way to the Egyptians. The fact that you can be stood centimetres from antiquities from over 1000 years ago boggles the mind. The information presented was concise and allowed my daughter to carry out the research she required. We spent a good few hours here and barely scratched the surface of other departments and collections. There's literally thousands of specimens from across history that we did not see on this visit and look forward to seeing in the future.,"Stunning, Vast and Comprehensive"
"August 4, 2023","While constantly thinking that much of this collection should be repatriated to home countries, I was very happy that such a comprehensive collection of art, decor, jewelry, and more, spanning from the beginning of human civilization and across the globe. We only spent one day, and it got VERY crowded fairly quickly. We did not buy the audio tour, and were OK with the good descriptions throughout. We did think that a guided tour may be quite worth the price.",Disgusting verbal abuse from staff and no toilet access! AVOID
"July 18, 2023","The museum itself is great, however at 4:30pm, 30 minutes before the museum closes, all the toilet shut and you are directed to the front entrance to use the toilet. I got redirected 3 times before asking someone who completely refused to let me use the toilet. Then this man let another pregnant women go to use the toilet and when I announced I was pregnant too he laughed in my face and said no I’m ‘just fat’! As a 25 week pregnant women I was extremely applauded and disgusted by this comment, let alone the disrespect of letting another pregnant women who was not much further along than myself go to the toilet while refusing me. When I expressed my disgust and demanded to speak to a manager the security man then decided to let me go to the toilet. Once through I was stopped by yet another worker told I could not go. After explaining the whole situation she still was resistant to letting me use the toilet but eventually did, where I met a queue of people inside the toilet anyway! This whole situation for anyone is appalling let alone being verbal abuse by staff. Because of this experience I will never return to the British Museum and am extremely disappointed that they would employe verbally abusive staff members. So if you do want to visit don’t expect to use the toilet facilities within the last hour of opening time and if you happen to be pregnant get ready for being called fat instead!",Some Disappointments
"November 7, 2023","The Museum has plenty of interesting things to see and more than can be covered in a few hours. If traveling from afar, I suggest some research before you go so you can focus on what interests you. There were some disappointments however, which indicate no matter how well you think you have planned, it can all fall in a heap when the organisation doesn't live up to expectations. We had pre-booked tickets, and I highly recommend that you do, even though they are free. Despite tickets, you have to line up with everyone else, a line that extended to the end of the block. Once you reach the gates things move quicker as you are sorted into ticket and non-ticket holders. My focus was to visit the Parthenon Marbles. To my disappointment the gallery was closed even though there was no indication of this in the inforation we received the day prior to our visit or on the website. The websites was still announcing the gallery was opening at 11am and it was listed on their list of ""Available Galleries"". I asked a staff member about access and was informed the gallery had been closed all week and they didn't know why or when it would re-open. Another disappointment was the App. The free information was very general. The additional information, I was hoping for, was locked and required a fee to access. I resorted to searching the internet. I suspect the information I found was less bias. I was also disappointed by the lack of engagement by staff in the galleries. Most were seated and many were on their devices. Apart from the entry process, the museum seemed to cope with the crowd. Lines for the cafe and toilets were satisfactory. Displays were mostly easy to access and were well presented, although some information was too far away to be read, either with or without reading glasses. ",British museum.
"June 20, 2020","It is amazing what can be learned in this place. There are many kinds of guides, it is advisable to go with one, it is enjoyed in a different way. Still this museum with free admission (through tips) is amazing, it has a bit of every great civilization and takes you to another world.",British Museum visit.
"October 9, 2022","Huge museum, lots of people, be prepared to stay in line to enter, but it moves fast.  If you are not bringing any bags (backpack, purse, bags) you just walk in without been screened.  Amazing collection of Greek, Macedonian and Egyptian cultures, the only problem was that some tourists will just get too close to some statues that is frigtenight that they might tip over it.  There is a restaurant in the top of the museum that serves amazing food.  The Museum shops had a great variety of nice gifts.",Brilliantly fascinating
"February 3, 2020","We had visited the British Museum before during a visit to London but knew we had only scraped the surface of the place.  When we saw there was a Troy exhibition on we decided to go back and we’re really delighted we did.  The exhibition was incredibly interesting and well done, bringing the whole story to life.If you’re in London it’s a must do",So much to see!
"June 29, 2021","Great place to visit but be warned, it's massive! We scheduled four hours for this visit but didn't even get through a quarter of what's there in that time. There is so much to see but, because of the size, it may be a little bit much for young children. Worth taking some water with you because it's a bit like a maze, once you start it""s kind of hard to get back to the central area where the cafe's located. ",A Cornucopia of World Treasures
"January 27, 2022","A cornucopia of world treasures, there is a slice of world history for everyone at this museum. I often use the British Museum as a litmus test for people I want to get to know better, as you can tell a lot about a person's character by what parts of history they are interested in and which artefacts they tend to look at the longest.I first went to this museum as a child a couple of decades ago and was fascinated by the ancient Egyptian section. As I grew up my tastes changed, and I now enjoy spending significant time looking around the Chinese, Mayan, Incan and Inuit sections learning more about cultures, beliefs and writing methods I never got the chance to learn about when younger. As I learn more about languages in relation to computers, the way that other pre-modern cultures used their own fascinates me and I always wonder what the world might have been had these become more dominant.I strongly recommend spending more than 5 hours, if not an entire day here. I have been going every couple of years for the past 2 decades and I still find unique insights from coming here. The artefacts on display are matched with clear explanations and dates explaining their relevance and context to each time period and room. There are places to sit down and rest if you do have tired feet, or aren't quite as mobile, and there is at least one café that offers cafeteria style food if you do find yourself hungry.If you're young, and are curious about everything, or older and wiser, and have read around history and literature, this museum has something for you.",Beautiful
"February 17, 2020","Extremely interesting. It captures the different aspects of everyday life of all the cities of the past and not. Interesting the approach to ancient works of modern installations, not as meaningless as happens in the modern niche. interesting is the part dedicated to the objects of daily life of the ancient Romans, to the marbles of the Parthenon, to the stele of rosetta..but also to the oriental civilizations. In addition to visit the top floor where there are the only cardboard that is left of Michelangelo.",A wonderful museum full of fantastic displays
"January 30, 2020","There is so much to see in this wonderful building, it is full of some of the most precious treasures from around the world. The building itself is worth visiting in it's own right, and the, now covered central hall is magnificent. The displays range from monumental to the small and delicate. it deserves to be visited more than once to fully appreciate it's contents.",Bit disappointed
"July 12, 2022","We enjoyed the Egyptian exhibit, however if my mother in law hadn't been with us we would have had to queue to get into the museum, one security guard waved us through the barrier, as she was suffering from heat exhaustion. Very few places to sit apart from the cafes, museum can be a bit of maze not very well sign posted, lifts seem not well sign posted and there don't seem to be many of them. The toilets I used were downstairs, I had to queue to use them, 2 cubicles were missing doors and could not be used, the sanitary bin was full to overflowing, it was obvious that they hadn't been checked or cleaned recently. When I went to complain I couldn't find anyone who seemed interested in doing anything about it, they stated they would TRY to speak to a cleaner. With the amount of visitors, covid infections on in the increase I would have thought that the toilets should be checked, cleaned and sanitary bins emptied on a regular basis.",Cool stuff: 5 stars; Organization: 3 stars
"December 16, 2023","We wanted to see the Rosetta Stone so made a reservation online for a day which we later discovered to be the kids' holiday from school, so the place was mobbed. So rule #1: don't go during the kids' holiday from school. Rule #2: don't bother with making an online reservation because you still have to queue up in the godawful long line that snakes around the entire building if you don't follow Rule #3: go as early in the morning as possible. We did manage to elbow our way through the hordes and see the Rosetta Stone, along with the Elgin Marbles and the Assyrian wing, which actually was our favorite part of our visit. We also loved seeing the Egyptian artifacts as we spent a chunk of time in Egypt touring including two visits to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The artifacts in London were beautifully curated and in pristine condition - quite the cream of the crop (imagine that).So, bring your patience if you go on a popular day, but aside from that, worth a visit.  ",Price is right
"November 16, 2022",One of the free things to do in London. Enjoyed stepping back in time. Ramses bust is very impressive. You will miss things go twice it’s free. Only downside was original Rosetta Stone was moved to a pay section of museum. A copy was in another section. ,A must for anyone visiting London.
"August 30, 2020",The British museum houses an extraordinary collection of fascinating artefacts from all over the world. The Egyptian section is fantastic for kids (and adults) there is so much to see. It is beautifully curated and well worth the visit. I could spend days in there.,Little boring but interesting
"August 18, 2023","One of the biggest museums I've visited in my life and I must say it's really big. Full of objects and information about the Egyptian civilization. I must say that anyone who doesn't master the theme or doesn't like it will end up finding it boring (my case). The best, for me, was the gift shop. The most time consuming process was security, since tickets were purchased online",Amazing Museum!
"October 10, 2022","If you appreciate history, you can't go to London without visiting the British Museum. The original Rosetta Stone is here. It's a large museum so you'll have to pick and choose what you really want to see if you have a limited time. Cafe and gift shop options inside also good.",Amazing
"April 12, 2021",Can't get enough of this place.  I love to wander round and take in the breathtaking pieces from across time and the world. The grandness of the Great Hall as you enter the building sets you up for the magnificence which is to follow.,Amazing Museum of World History
"August 24, 2022","We loved both the Greek and Egyptian sections of the museum.  Having been to Greece and seen the Parthenon, it was neat to see the parts of the Parthenon that made their way to England.  The number of Egyptian mummies and Assyrian sculpture were amazing!  Although we could have taken a full day to see this museum our feet were tired after little more than half a day.",£10 cafe meal deal not working
"April 27, 2023",Beware the widely advertised £10 meal deal in the ground floor cafe bars is not valid. As of 27/04/2023 the signs are new but their toll systems have not been update to allow it. Whatever you buy will be at the listed price per piece. ,Timed Ticketing System Is An Epic Fail!
"August 10, 2023","The timed ticketing system is not fit for purpose in its current form.  There is no point offering this system where a time is chosen, and then consumers are expected to turn up at their allocated time and then join a 2 hour queue to gain access to the museum.Museum management need to fix this quickly as the public is being denied reasonable access to the museum.I have now missed my planned opportunity to visit the museum.",Really interesting
"August 19, 2021",A must if you are going to London. Really interesting exhibits in a spacious building. We went as a couple and then back the next day with our 7 year old who particularly enjoyed the Egyptian exhibits. A shame that not every gallery is currently open but means we’re even more likely to return.,A must to visit in London
"November 23, 2021",I have the privilege of seeing my ancestors great history (Cyrus the great) cylinder and i spent most of my time in museum in Persia’s part and then in Peru exhibition. For such a huge museum and beautiful exhibitions we didn’t need to pay and it makes it more interesting as you didn’t feel rushed while being there. _good café_polite staffs _long lines but not long time waiting _free entrance _complete collections _highly recommended,Sardine can
"August 17, 2023","This place needs more organization, I get that entry is free, but they need a little more regulation with how many people can enter. The building jam packed with people.We went mainly to see the Egypt section, but due to the number of people, we didn't see everything we wanted, and I thought there would be more mummies on display, maybe it depends on the time of year. Just be advised for those sensitive the warmer temperatures the build doesn't seem to have A/C so some exhibits can get extremely hot depending  on how many people are in it",Impossible
"October 1, 2023","We had always wanted to visit the British Museum but fitting it into our very full schedule was always a challenge . However we managed to organize a Day in London on a Saturday in July . Unfortunately we were unaware that this was the 1st Day of the Summer Holidays . When we arrived we found that there were thousands of People trying to enter the museum . Entrance is Free and is booked on their Website . Everyone must go through a Security Check before entering the Museum . The large Entrance is up a Flight of wide steps . Which meant negotiating large numbers of People sitting on the Steps , contrary to the signs Not to sit on the Steps . They need to move the people on from the steps as it was so crowded . Inside was no better . It was ridiculous . So many people . It was impossible to spend time studying exhibits . We stuck it out for just an hour and gave up .",Brilliant for all ages.
"August 20, 2022","Throughly enjoyed our visit to the British museum. There is a huge collection of varied artefacts to see. We were particularly taken by the Greek, Assyrian, Chinese & Indian sections. Plenty to see for all ages, lots of interesting facts to read or simply just walk around and look at the displays. You can easily see as much or as little as you please as the map highlights its top things to see around the museum. The cafe area can become quite busy so I’d suggest planning time to visit if needed. Although we visited during summer it was very hot in some sections so would suggest a portable fan if you’re able to take one with you just for comfort.","From Sutton Hoo to Assyrian reliefs, there's everything here"
"August 1, 2021","We went to see the Sutton Hoo exhibits because of The Dig. It's fascinating, not least because it shows the international trading that was taking place even 1500 years ago.We then moved on to look at the Assyrian exhibits. It's amazing to think that you're looking at real materials 3500 years old, and you can see amazing detail in the reliefs.I guess it's obvious, but the British Museum really does justify many visits, not just once for a couple of hours.",Excellent
"February 23, 2020",I often revisit and always make for the Assyrian Rooms. The wall panels are interesting if you spend time examining them. Lots of detail. And the shop has many books and other things to buy. But you cannot do the whole museum in one go. It is too big. Another part that is of interest is the Clock collection. I really do recommend that you visit this part of the collections.,Only for the British history
"July 5, 2023","The museum itself was very nice, however, some the exhibits cost an extra fee which not knowing how good they were we did not partake.  The rest of the museum was extensive and the local exhibits of medieval England was on point, though they should clean the jewelry to show off the shine.  The other stuff, you can see in most museums, like mummies etc.  Main point, when England is having a heat wave, this museum is not airconditioned.  ",Must See!
"January 15, 2020",A great way to spend half a day. There are lots of amazing things in the collection - so many that it’s difficult to see and properly appreciate them all in one visit. Entrance is by donation and there are lots of options for tours. We went right when it opened and the crowds were very light for the first few hours.,A brilliant visit
"October 19, 2022","This is an absolutely outstanding museum with so much to see, a day simply is not enough to take in the volume of exhibits and information. It’s laid out across 3/4 floors and they are huge, very well maintained and extremely clean.Lots of staff around to help and they have an app which is excellent to give you an idea of each exhibit hall you enter what it relates to. Restaurant and Coffee shop on site and lots of places to rest your weary feet.Enter via the Montague Street entrance if open as less busy than the main entrance.Does get extremely busy so be warned it won’t be quiet.",Superb
"July 25, 2023","I spent 6 hours in the Museum and enjoyed every minute of it. The place is filled to the brim with beautiful artefacts to marvel at, with interesting placards to explain it all. I went to one of the paid exhibition, which was even more amazing as the curation allowed you to make better sense of the story behind everything and how it all ties together. Take a sandwich and a drink with you to eat in the Great Court to save a little money. Thoroughly recommend. I want to go back the next time I'm in London","Busy, but efficient. "
"October 25, 2023","We visited on a Saturday so queues to be expected. Whilst we did wait in line we managed to get through it quickly and easily, the baggage check being great - the gent not at a station pulled us over as I only had my small handbag, checked it and waved us through. Excellent! We picked up a map of the Museum, as it was so crammed with people, we just did the sections we were interested in and skipped the rest. Having room numbers on the map was helpful to navigate ourselves around.Toilets are well sign posted and maintained, and the gift shop plentiful and staff friendly. ",Whats British about it ?
"March 1, 2023","My wife and I visited this museum after a somewhat deflated visit to the Victoria & Albert museum the day before.We were after exhibits of British life and customs through the ages with artifacts and costumes/daily life etc.Dont buy tickets on line as it is free - if you want to offer a donation, do so inside. We queued  for some time but that was okay.The auditorium is huge - very impressive, but as others have said, it shouldnt be there to win awards for its architectural merits. The layout is still confusing despite a free 'map' (compounded by sparse information of where you actually are and which rooms go where after). Having said that, the staff available are helpful and pleasant for advice.My primary gripe is that this is the British Museum and, in my opinion, should reflect the history and heritage of this island throughout the ages up until the present. Instead, it is full of relics, sculptures, jewellery, pottery, etc, salvaged/procured from around the world (mainly Egypt and Asia) by affluent collectors from the @victorian era.It took me half an hour to come across the word 'Britain' in a display somewhere upstairs !There were so many rooms containing exhibits from Korea, China, Egypt and elsewhere that I felt it was just a celebration of everyone elses culture except 'ours'.I am no zenophobe but I felt all the museum represented was that the British were good at 'obtaining' artefacts in favour of our own culture !Nicely displayed and clean but not actually 'British' at all !!!If the British Museum doesnt contain any historical",Give back the Parthenon sculptures 
"October 14, 2020","Even though you see exhibits from all over the world and this museum worths a visit . Being Greek I will mention the Parthenon Sculptures and the Caryatis . I really liked the clocks and watches section that travelled me back to time . My favorite also was the Asian exhibits of India , China and Japan ",A Marvellous Museum
"December 15, 2022","The biggest museum in Britain and one of the biggest in Europe, the British Museum is full of thousands of displays and many sectors from across the world. The most notable sector is the Egyptian Sector which houses the Rosetta Stone and the Bust of Ramesses the Great. Another sector is the Greek and Parthenon which houses many Parthenon sculptures, Crouching Venus Sculpture and the Sophilos Vase. Other notable sectors include the African, Life and Death, Egyptian Mummies and Chinese Sectors. My favourite room which looks the greatest is the Library of Enlightenment which houses The Piranesi Vase at its centre. There are so many displays to look at there is too many to look at in a day, but you can spend about 3- 4 hours looking at the best ones that catch your eye.",Amazing
"September 3, 2021","If you like history and want to walk around ogling all the artefacts that we “found” and “borrowed” during the time of Empire, British not Darth Vadars, then this is the place for you.Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and the Kings Library is stunning.Well worth a trip and I’m sure that we will return it all to it’s rightful owners at some point.",Extensive collection of the worlds treasures
"January 25, 2022",This stunning building houses a range of quite mind-blowing artifacts opening up a whole new world centred around the dynasties of the past and right up to the present. The treasures and history are at times beyond belief and re-curring visits are essential as each time you will uncover something different. Toilets and refreshments in abundance meaning you could stay for hours or equally just pop in for a spare hour. ,Not impressed there was no advance warning of their strike action.
"February 3, 2023","Came here to visit only to find out they were on strike. I support the museum staff's cause, but there were guards on site at the gates and people walking in and out so it did not make sense. Better information to visitors required. I checked the website the day before making plans but there was no warning. Not impressed. Wanted to see the Elgin Marbles and African displays on this visit but will have to wait till next time.","Poorly lit, lovely collection"
"July 5, 2020",We could barely see the art and pieces due to poor lighting. It's also much more cramped and looked a bit cheap. The experience itself was a bit stressful because people around you keep touching the sculptures so there's a need for more security! ,We went three times in two weeks and still didn't see all we wanted.
"November 6, 2022","This museum never disappoints, although we were lucky enough to be coming back when the exhibits we wanted to see were closed. You can check first thing in the morning to see what's closed. We couldn't predict the queues. We had no wait for the first 3 visits but on a fourth attempted visit the queue went around the block. It moved quickly but we decided we didn't want to be in a crowded museu.",Queues
"November 4, 2023","The first thing you will encounter when visiting the British Museum are the queues outside. These will move fairly swiftly so don’t be put off. You might consider mitigating those queues by bookjng a time slot to visit online. This is free and will provide you with an emailed entry ticket. So far so good. Once you get the other side of the railings you will be presented with three lanes. One for British Museum members, one for those with time specific entry tickets and those who’ve just rocked up unannounced. What you need to know is that at the end of the queues is a bag check. If you take the members lane you will whizz past the other queues. No one asks to see any proof of membership. At the end of the members lane it simply merges with the lane for those with timed entry tickets. Again no one is there to check anything. You’ve now saved yourself about half an hours wait. Once you get inside the covered white tent like area no one looks at your membership card or your timed emailed tickets.  No checks whatsoever. All that happens in this area is a security bag check and that’s it. Sadly,  I did what I thought was the responsible thing and applied for a time slot, got my ticket emailed and joined the queue for the ticket holders.  I needn’t have bothered. This is just a bag check for everyone regardless of which ticket you hold or indeed no ticket at all. It’s up to you and your conscience which one you go for and how much you like standing in a queue in the rain for no apparent reason. PS All the gallery rooms from number 50 upwards are shut. That’s all the Greek, Roman and Egyptian exhibits. Didn’t see any notice on the web site warning that one of the most popular attractions is out of action. It’s a great experience and well worth the visit. These are all minor inconveniences in the great scheme of things. Talking of conveniences, if your are female please visit the loo before coming here. The queues are horrendous as there aren’t enough female toilets.",Huge Disappointment/Major Sections Closed
"August 15, 2023","I have to say our visit to this museum may have been our greatest travel disappointment ever. Unfortunately for us ( and all other visitors that day in May, 2023), the museum chose to close THREE major areas on the same day. We were unable to access the Egyptian mummies, the entire Assyrian section, and major exhibits in the Greece section. This is absolutely, completely unacceptable. I understand the need to close sections for maintenance and cleaning. But 3 major sections on the same day? Unforgivable. Unfortunately, we may never get back to old London Town, but if we do, we won’t waste our time here. I strongly suggest you call ahead before you go to avoid the unforgettable disappointment we experienced. Good luck…..",Still great despite ground floor access restrictions
"January 15, 2023","Still way too much to see and as always too many people makes seeing some of the exhibits challenging but this is still one of my favourite places in London.I hadn't been here for a few years but most of the favourites are still there, some of the Egyptian statues and most notably the Rosetta Stone are in the Heiroglyphics Exhibition, I hope to see those again in the coming weeks but there is so much else to see. The route through the museum ground floor to the Egyptian Room 4 has been restricted as has some of the Assyrian exhibits, the route for the masses takes you through Greek and Roman periods to get to the Egyptian statues so it feels a bit disjointed from a chronological perspective. I'm not sure if this is a Covid Hangover or there was some genuine maintenance going on. Overall a minor detraction but hopefully the freedom of the restrictions will get restored for access to one of the jewels in the crown of the BM.",A collection displaying the world in one place
"January 26, 2023","All the years I have lived in London I have never visited the British Museum.  So today my wife and I booked a visit and went up.Some research online identified a map with 12 objects ""you must see"".  We saw 10, because two galleries were closed, but what this exercise gave us was an object lesson in navigating this amazing place.The free map you can pick up on your arrive includes details of 15 guided tours in various parts of the museum through the day.  After lunch we chose the Roman Britain tour and Medieval Europe tour.  They were both excellent.  The guides were knowledgeable and presented in a relaxed professional manner - I just wish I could remember their names.We also had the opportunity to handle some artefacts, again with a guide to explain them.All in all a very good day out.  One we will repeat to do more of the tours and artefacts stands.",Too many crowds (but a good lunch!)
"July 14, 2023","Like all places of importance in London, during our visit the museum was hindered a lot by the volume of the crowds. The museum itself is huge and yet it seemed every room or corridor was packed with people, so it made it hard to see a lot of the artefacts properly or look at them for long enough.We had lunch on the third floor restaurant, which took me a lot by surprise on how good it actually was. I had a delicious fish and chips and roulade for dessert.",Fabulous museum
"September 23, 2022",We visited recently on a busy Saturday and loved our visit. There is so much to see we didn't manage to get round the whole museum. I thought everything was well laid out and it was easy to follow a route. There is a good load of information at each exhibit and although busy we were able to read what we wanted to.There is a decent sized gift shop and cafe. We will be back.,Stonehenge - fabulous
"April 17, 2022",We joined the British Museum yesterday because we were in London and wanted to see the Stonehenge exhibition. It was a beautifully curated exhibition of artefacts from around Europe. There were some absolutely stunning exhibits on display - particularly the gold jewellery. We had lunch in the members lounge. It was comfortable and they serve salads from Benugo - delicious. We also shared a lovely piece of carrot cake.,very oldfashion museum
"September 1, 2022","Excellent collection of antiquities. Unfortunately, they are all stripped from wonderful temples that were left bare. Like the Parthenon or the Babylonian or Egyptian antiquities. Shame. They should all be returned to their homeland. Especially now that there are very good museums like the one on the Acropolis or the new to Egypt. The museum is outdated and the antiquities are crammed together without any display without respect. They should be immediately returned to where they belong.",Highly Recommended
"March 2, 2020","I really went to see the Lewis Chessmen and I wasn't disappointed. On my way out, a docent asked me if I'd like to, ""hold an object that is over 400,000 years old?""  Who wouldn't?  I said, ""yes"" and she plopped a hand ax into my hand and explained in detail everything about the object, it was an interesting lesson. She guided her talk into money with a bitcoin, of all things. By the time she finished, I had forgotten about the Elgin Marbles and spent quite a bit of time in ""Money in Crisis"" Germany Emergency Money 1914-1924.   This proved to be very interesting.  I returned to the museum once more during my visit to London.",Not very British
"September 19, 2021",We visited the museum hoping to learn about the history of Britain and were very disappointed to see it was full of items from other countries. It’s a great place if you’re looking to learn about a certain thing and you know it’s there. The Rosetta Stone was the most interesting part. A guided tour is probably worthwhile as there is A LOT to see.,Time for tour
"March 19, 2022",I've visited the museum many times in the past and spent hours in the galleries. Always interesting. This time I went on the 2.30pm Ancient Egypt free tour. The lady volunteer who gave the talk added interesting information on the relevant displays which you wouldn't have known just browsing on your own. Very good.,Fantastic British Museum
"January 17, 2023","First of all, in order to visit the British Museum, a booking is necessary. The entrance is free of charge unless you visit a temporary exhibition. The inside is really worth the journey. We loved the Egyptian part of the Museum but many other areas are interesting.",Amazing place - something for all ages.
"August 16, 2021","The British Museum has an amazing collecion of  artefacts. It  covers historical and contemporary objets from across the world. Some of the best exhibitins I have ever seen have been here. I have recently seen three exhibitions: Thomas Becket - Murder and the Making of Saint; Nero; Reflections - artists of the Middle East and North Africa which was insightful and beautiful. We mustn't overlook how the Museum came to acquire much of its collection (Empire, Colonialism, Conquest and thievery). ",The Ancient World in One place
"January 27, 2020","What a stunning place! Extraordinary collection from old Egypt, Africa, Greece ... The Rosetta Stone, the Parthenon frescoes, antique sculptures ... so many to see and so many ... people! Take your time even though the museum is relatively small vs other renowned museums.",You may miss the Becket exhibit
"July 11, 2021","A very disappointing visit to the Becket exhibit. It was shallow, not informative, not insighful and childish. All in all it was  like a very well executed high school project.So much more could have been shown re Becket's rise to the chancellorship and then to the Archbishopric. Much more could have been told about how and why Becket incurred such anger on King Henry's side. Much more could have been inferred from the whole affair regarding the place of church and state, Protestant and Catholic, and the present day balance in the UK, where there's officially no separation of church and state whereas the British are some of the least religious people in the free world. Something went seriously wrong in the preperation of this exhibition.Regarding other exhibits, where many parts were sealed off, I feel it's not fair to judge at this time.",Just like all the other amazing museums in London
"July 29, 2021",The museum had a beautiful interior and exterior. It had a lot to show as well in terms of history. I would suggest bringing a hand-held fan as it was stuffy inside the museum.   It was 27 degrees on the day we went that they had to close the roman exhibit due to the heat. Other than that I would recommend visiting this magnificent place.,Overwhelming amount to take-in
"June 3, 2022","We allocated only 1/2 day to the museum and that was a good move. Why you ask? Because there is simply way too much to take in everything on one visit. If I lived in London I could easily see a weeks worth of visits to read every description and study every exhibit. Limiting our time to 1/2 day meant it was time to leave after we were all saturated. It's a great museum and I am glad we went. Be aware there are two entrances a front that I understand is usually crowded, and a ""back"" that is less crowded. Glad we chose the later and simply walked in. Be prepared to run your bag thru a security check.",A bit disappointing.
"September 8, 2022","There was a wide range of exhibits but the building is huge and not always well signposted. Lifts were few and far between and the interior of the building was somewhat stark. Probably better to visit this museum prior to some of the architectural splendour of the National Gallery, St Paul’s Cathedral, etc.",The Spotlight tour will open your eyes to Ancient Egypt.
"September 28, 2023","I was visiting the museum and came across the spotlight tour about death in ancient Egypt, In the Egyptian gallery.Our guide,Douglas was knowledgeable, friendly and most well informed.(He even made a couple of ancient Egyptian jokes- not easy !)He made everyone fell included and had close up pictures to illustrate his talk.We moved around the gallery and he showed us items and symbols that we would have missed had we just been wandering through.He spent 20 minutes after the talk answering questions from his audience, which he had no problem answering- he clearly has a passion for his subject.Highly recommended- can’t wait to go back for more.",Not the best
"July 10, 2023","For all the free things to do I would give this a miss. I felt the signage/information didn't say much about where things came from. It was far too busy to be able to look. We booked tickets but no one checked them and you still had to join a queue which seemed totally pointless, also it was so busy when you got inside.",World Class
"June 17, 2021","There is no museum like it. The British Museum is an art, archaeology, sculpture and decorative treasure. So many things from Egypt including the Rosetta Stone (that's how we know what hieroglyphs say). Have to see it. CAN'T miss it.","Must be there , never miss one of the best museum in the World"
"February 11, 2020","Spare at least 3 hr to visit this place , they will bring you back in time from mummy to present , from Africa to Asia. Must visit zone about Egyptian history and Greek-Roman Exhibition. Pls come early to avoid issue OOS of head phone service.",Incredible Experience..
"November 11, 2021","One of the greatest museums in the world.  Remarkable & unmatched.   Because Britian kind of ruled the world in the 1800s & early 1900s, it did take art fromeverywhere.  When you realize that, and the quality and originality of the art and historical objects you will realize how great this place is.  From ancient Greek artto original books written by monks in the 1400s to Syrian Art from the middle east, it is here.  This is a world class great place...  In London you got to visit it.What is in this museum, is beyond  description.  ...Go there and see for yourself..  Then, you will know about the true greatness of....The British Museum.",Great day out for the whole family.
"November 5, 2022","A great day it for the family with lots to see and read and view. We went and saw the Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Asian and south Asian history and artefacts used in those times.  Kids absolutely loved all the displays and reading up on all the history of each thing they saw there.  We stayed for nearly 4Hours and even that we didn’t get to see the whole museum as it’s so big. Def have to make a trip back to see the rest of what we missed. A great day out and free too. Only asking for a donation as you wish to pay.",Breath Taking Architecture
"October 12, 2020","An absolutely amazing place to visit, the architecture inside and out is nothing short of breath taking, literally as soon as you walk in.I had a friend visit from Australia, so I did the normal haunts around London but this was the cherry on the cake, we walked round for nearly 4 hours taking in all the sights.All the staff are super friendly and very knowledgeable which makes your visit so much nicer.",Beautiful Museum
"June 6, 2023",Went with some friends in London and really enjoyed our day at the museum. It is large and didn't feel crowded even though the long security line outside says differently. Entrance is free but with a suggested donation. The exhibits are well displayed and labeled,The Marvelous British Museum
"August 31, 2023","The British Museum can be described in a nutshell: stratospherically beautiful. Even as you stand in line outside, you can sense the beauty of the museum inside as well. As soon as you enter you are completely lost to admire it all.Huge collection, I highly recommend a visit.",Don't miss the Korea Room!
"January 26, 2022","We have visited the British Museum several times. During the most recent visit, we found the Korean Room.  I like Korean pottery very much and did not know this museum had a Korean area.  It isn't easy to find.  The map show it as an island detached from the rest of the space.  It is worth searching out.  Extraordinary display of Korean art & ceramic ware, both ancient and modern. We enjoyed the rest of the museum, of course, ancient Greece, ancient Britain but Korea was a revelatory experience!",Fantastic Collection of British Plunder
"January 10, 2022","A fantastic day out for anyone remotely interested in fascinating artefacts we British have plundered over the years 🙂, Gladiators Helmets & Weapons Asian Masks, Egyptian Statues .. the list is endless. The central atrium is also an architectural masterpiece.",Great to see but……
"July 13, 2023","Fantastic museum to visit and explore, very good content to see that is also interactive in areas to keep the young kids engaged.But the over crowding takes away from the experience, they should reduce the amount of people that can go through the doors at once.Still very good to see and would recommend going, just be prepared for the chaos.",Empowering experience
"June 14, 2022","I recently visited the ‘Feminine Power: the divine to the demonic’ exhibition - it was exceptional! I visited with my adult daughter and her friend and we were all completely blown away by it.  The combination of text explaining each item, the written reactions of the public, along with the comments of the exhibitions female collaborators was absolutely spot on. There was a claim at the entrance that said I would be changed by what I saw - and they were right. Can’t recommend this highly enough.",for the Rosetta Stone
"September 23, 2022","took the Around the World tour - 90  min - guide was knowledgeable but unfortunately didn't speak loud enough, if you were not right next to her, you could not hear the information;  would have been great to have the head phone/mike like in other museums facilities.  Quite disappointed.  no problem spending 4 hours discovering the treasures the museum has to offer.",Impressive
"May 2, 2022",The Stonehenge exhibition rightly deserves the acclaim. Deeply atmospheric you are immersed in the history and anthropology of ancient Britain. Understanding the value to the community including not only as a burial site but of it’s importance in Europe was enlightening. The thought that’s gone into the sounds of the sea and air as well as the light animations is impressive. If you can go you won’t regret it.,Hot and Crowded
"July 3, 2023","Please be advised that if you are heat-intolerant, this isn't the place for you in the summer! We went mid-June when it was about 80F outside. We walked in and the atrium was very warm. I thought it may be due to all the windows making it like a greenhouse. Well, we went into one of the exhibit wings and it was even hotter in there! Warm, stagnant air, packed with people. No air flow. There was one dinky stand fan and the museum worker was sitting on a bench with the fan pointed at her face. Lol. There's no way to concentrate and read/look at everything  when you've got sweat rolling down your back. We walked out and it was much cooler outside. So, that visit was a big waste of time. We did go previously in Dec 2021 and enjoyed it. There is a lot to see and read which is why we went back this time - to see what we may have missed.",Brilliant
"January 13, 2022",So this was one of first places we visited in London. We were extremely excited to see the Egyptians. The mummy collection is unreal. The museum is massive. There was a few things closed off when we were there but hopefully when I’m back it will be open again. Yet again the staff are very friendly and are extremely helpful. It’s also free to get into if your looking for something to do and you don’t want to spend a lot of money. ,Highlights for a family with a 8year old child
"January 3, 2023","We had 2 days, one for the free exhibitions and one for the hieroglyphs exhibition. For the first day we had a time reservation but it really did not matter. Access was easy with reasonable waiting times. We enjoyed the Parthenon sculptures, the Assyrian artefacts and, of course, the Egyptian ones. Roman Britain was also interesting.",LOVED this museum
"January 4, 2020","Go here - plan for 3-4 hours. FASCINATING museum, even our teens loved it!  Get a guide at the info desk and it'll will tell you what all of the MUST SEE's are and where they are in the museum but make sure you wander throughout the other rooms.  It's all so fascinating!",Free Trip Through Time
"August 6, 2022","The British Museum has a large inventory of historical items that go back to the Egyptian era.  The actual Rosetta Stone is there!  And it's free.  If you don't spend at least an hour there, you're not trying.  It's a 2-4 hour event.  And it's free.  Be ready to stand in line and have your bags searched.  ",Magnificent
"September 3, 2022","There is a vast collection of relics and artefacts from all around the world which also draws visitors from over the world as there is something each of us can relate to. The building is huge and beautiful with so much information to learn from. Unfortunately there is not enough time to just spend one day at the museum. I would suggest looking at what they have available and which room they are contained in, then plan your day accordingly otherwiseYou will be exhausted at the end",so much history!
"August 6, 2021",Incredible building with so much history in we were very overwhelmed.  We were booked for 2pm and the queue was next to nothing.  Bag check on the way in and then all done.  We purchased a guide book and map (there is a smaller version of the map in the guide book) and set to.Our only gripe was we hadn't seen the planned closure of the area which we were most looking forward to.  This is the main reason our visit was shorter than we expected.Would definitely recommend this as a great way to learn about human history and we will 100% be back when the Greece/Rome rooms reopen.,Extensive free to enter museum
"March 9, 2023","Visited here on a recent trip to London, as hadn't been there since I was a kid! Plenty of rooms, off rooms, off other rooms (!!) all full of artefacts and collections from different parts of the world, other cultures and times, so plenty to delight the ardent museum goer. Good free talks on variety of subjects throughout the day, although both the ones we'd have liked weren't running on the day we visited. We also found that some of the exhibitions we'd have liked to visit were closed 'for refurbishment' (or some such?) so we missed out on those. Nice that they have now infilled the main courtyard in the centre (Millennium project, I think?) so all indoors now. You could spend a week going round here and still not see all you wanted to see, especially as the rooms 'map' in the booklet is quite difficult to follow, we found. A half day was about right for us - after that we were 'museumed out'!!",Exciting Museum for History Buffs!
"February 21, 2020","I've wanted to go to The British Museum since I was a child, and I was not disappointed. Their collection of Egyptian artifacts is amazing, and we enjoyed the Byzantine collection, as well. But perhaps most exciting was the special exhibition on Troy. OMG, I am a lifelong fan of mythology, and this exhibit traced the history and story of the Trojan War. I think it would be an archaeologist and historian's dream to assemble an exhibit like this ... taking physical evidence of the people and times, and interweaving it with mythology. It was terrific.",Worth a visit
"May 7, 2023","An amazing museum.  It is extremely large, and in it you can find various objects of inestimable value.  It took us 3 hours to go through it, but we just flew over some parts.  It would take 2 days for a detailed review.  The most interesting parts are the Rosette, mummies, Aztec and Babylonian ornaments, Greek statues, samurai clothing, etc. In my opinion, there are too many different vessels from Greece and Egypt and wall inscriptions from Mesopotamia.  It is valuable, but it is of interest only to historians.  It is good to make an entrance reservation from home, because that way you can skip the queue.",A must see London museum
"August 30, 2022","With so much to see, it's difficult to know where to start.  Even with a plan and a map, it can be difficult to find you way around.  The Great Court  is a wonderful piece of architecture.  I'm not normally a fan of Foster and Partners work, but in this instance it's worthy of mention and has created a useable, covered space.   It does get busy busy on rainy days in London. The museum is one of London's must see museums, but don't forget there are others.  Maybe not as big or with the same kudos, but they are worth a visit","The Spiritual Predecessor to OJ's ""If I Did It"""
"May 8, 2022","This is an unapolagetic shrine to the horrors of British Imperialism. Its callous disregard for any sort of human decency is frankly appalling. Furthermore, the exhibits aren't very well done and the museum is poorly organized. Not worth it even though it's free.",Not same as used to be
"April 14, 2022","Well, definitely museum has a lot of to see, therefore I come here every time I visit London. However, main different between this time and 10 years ago is that, looks like BM need to invest more to work on manners and custumer service of their security guards, especially in the morning and in front entrance. Not that people wait in huge line and hours before they can enter, but being treated very rude manners and as cattle in stock by security guards. Totally not acceptable for cultural institution.",Family visit 
"September 13, 2020",Thought it would be a good time to visit as they limit the amount of people going in. It wasn’t really busy but plenty of people in there. You could easily see everything without being close to people. Everyone is required to wear a mask and I only saw three people without. There is only one set of toilets open. With a one way system in place some areas are closed. Large shop open and cafe.,Great information and easy to read
"October 8, 2023",Lovely day out you spend however long you want. InsideThe information points were very detailed and easy to read We only did 2.5hrs because for us that was enough.

Its galleries are a treasure trove of knowledge and beauty, and its exhibitions are sure to leave a lasting impression.",One of the Great Museums of the World
"November 25, 2023","The British Museum is the repository of a fabulous collection of artifacts from around the world, much of it looted (or taken with ""permission"" given by subservient local regimes) during the height of the British Empire.  While the origins of much of the collection are fraught, this museum is not to be missed and it is hard to see the entire collection in one visit.  An endless variety of great works of art.","An invaluable collection of items, borrowed by the British from the world. "
"December 6, 2022","The is hard to capture just how much beauty and history is in the British Museum.  On one hand it is sad that the citizens of the countries of origin will never see it, on the other had we can. There is too much to see in one visit. Maybe pick an era or a geography and go deep. There is mobile app (very hard to use and constantly crashes) that is must use to hear the history. If you can get a tour guide, that is even better. ",Wonderful Museum
"November 17, 2022","Our third museum visit on the same day.  This was always our go to museum on past visits to London.There is so much to learn and rediscover here, and we love the Assyrian and Egyptian exhibits.Also, the huge covered roof creates such a wonderful place, with the two cafe dining areas bookending the souvenir store.The reading room upstairs is also a must visit.Entrance is free but you need to book your date and time online in advance.",Now is a great time to visit
"October 6, 2020","Another fascinating visit to the great place.How fortunate are we to have this museum, and now is the time to visit. So few people around and all the staff so very helpful, from Chris the bag searcher, also good at directions on departure, to the check in crew for not only the main admission but also the special Tantra exhibition. Just remember to arrange general admission before the allotted time slot to the Tantra exhibition.",Arctic exhibition
"October 27, 2020","Good exhibition, though perhaps not as spectacular as some of the museums special exhibitions. I would be way about attending if you have concerns about covid though. The exhibition was busier than expected (you still got scrums of people around particular displays) but more pertinently there were the odd absolute moron for whom any form of social distancing was an alien concept. At times it was enough to make me feel quite uncomfortable. The museum could probably do with some more prosvtive stewardonh",Great collection of ancient art and artifacts! And a grand display of historical power and taste.
"November 5, 2022","British museum is one of the world’s top ten museums, just by the enormity of the collection, for instance it has the best Egyptian department after Egypts own museum, and the best ancient Greek department after Athens. It may not belong to UK, or in a colonialMuseum but: Still; there are so many wonderful, crazy, huge, interesting things to see.  So go and see. And go back! You will never be disappointed!!",An incredible place to explore
"February 9, 2023","With its vast collection of artifacts, it is the perfect place to learn about world history and culture. The building is awe-inspiring and the exhibits are fascinating.

A must-see for anyone interested in history or culture.",What’s the point of telling us we need to book.
"April 16, 2022",We had to book a slot to get into the museum. None of them were that convenient but we did it anyway. We arrived at our allotted time and the queues were massive. I asked the “helper” if I needed to queue considering we had booked a slot and he very rudely told me to get in line. That was it. What’s the point in making people book tickets when the time slots count for nothing. This was a shambles. We ended up leaving.,So much to see so many people
"February 23, 2023","So much to see so many people.  When you show up there is sure to be a line down the street, don't worry it moved pretty fast.  Once inside it is easy to get overwhelmed with all that there is to see and how many people there are.  Could take days to really try to read and look at everything and might be best to split it up and take a break to get a bite to eat, rest then attack it again.Not sure if I would be young children here can see they getting bored very quickly.","The museum was amazing, but hope they charge for tickets"
"January 6, 2020","The exhibitions in the museum was amazing and nothing to compare of.  However, since it was free of entrance, there was not much order in the museum.  Group tours were blocking your view, air was thick due to the crowd, and uncontrolled parents & kids.",Perfect for a rainy day in London 
"March 21, 2023","Short, 3 days in London. I was told to spend some time at the British Museum. Relatively easy to book a timed entry appointment. Entry fee was free - always nice..There is sooooo much to see. I was only able to visit for 2 hrs. You need to give yourself closer to 4 hours - just to scratch the surface!I took the Enlightenment tour w/Jan. She was wonderful, insightful & witty.Next time I find myself in London (I will be back), I will pay for the self guided audio tour as well",Makes it easy to see the highlights
"February 29, 2020","Visited and saw the Rosetta Stone & Elgin marbles within an hour.  The museum is well appointed to see the highlights if you are pressed for time.  The Grand Court had a well appointed bookstore.  A must see and free.  Helpful hint:  The entrance at the back of the building had almost no line.  When we passed the entrance at the front, the line was backed up in a queue.  They check bags which slows things down so go around to the back entrance (where the member coat room is located) and breeze on in.  ",Awesome museum

The exhibitions are good.Sadly this time noticed  ore than ever, due to bruises.

Due to how busy it can be time the museum banned them.",Mixed feelings!
"July 12, 2023","This was the first national public museum of London. It was built in 1759 in Russel Street. It has a permanent display of more than 8 million exhibits. These come from all continents and cultures of the world. History of the mankind can be retraced here. I had mixed feelings about this museum. On one hand I felt that the British had plundered their colonies to bring these treasures here and that these objects were the properties of the countries the British took control of like the Rosetta Stone belonged to Egypt, Indian jewels belonged to India. But on the other hand I felt very lucky to see all these treasures well preserved and elegantly presented. Moreover the permanent part of the museum is free to public.",Amazing variety of ancient treasures 
"June 24, 2023","Too much to see in one visit! The Rosetta Stone, artifacts from ancient Egyptian eras, Assyrian antiquities, Chinese and Japanese art and much more if we had more time. Don’t go on a warm day if it can be avoided, there is no A/C in this enormous museum. The Greek and Roman statues were amazing as well. I can see why many countries would like to have these treasures returned!",Good tour for British history

"September 13, 2023","We clearly came in by the back door, there was no staff and no direction there at all.  We waited at least 10 minutes for the North lift to come down to -1  and opted to go out by the front door to avoid all the same hassle.

This is really one of the best if not the best museum that you will likely see in your life. It is exhausting however so make sure you allow enough time to take a break (or a few breaks) and don’t try to rush through it.  Also try to plan some highlights that you need to see in advance!",Great Museum
"September 8, 2022","We spent several hours wandering through this delightful museum on a Sunday morning. So much to see! We had a snack at the cafe, which was very good.

When we got to the Japanese paintings area there was a sign saying that the Great Wave is only displayed once every few years, I feel misled!  There should have been more information available to tell people that the Great Wave is not on display.",Too many people and very poorly organised.
"August 13, 2023",This is the most poorly organised museum I have ever been to. It really could be so much better.We arrived with a timed ticket. The queue was all the way down the road. We had no idea if the queue was for timed tickets or all other visitors.It turned out the queue was for everyone and there's no point booking a timed ticket as everyone goes in together. The bag searches were far too limited.When we got into the main entrance it was totally overwhelming. There were so many people packed in. I felt claustrophobic. It was dangerously busy.There needs to be a one way system to avoid the pushing and shoving. It was scary for the children at times and the amount of people in some areas was frightening.The museum and artifacts are fascinating but the experience could be so much better.,Amazing historical artifacts
"August 6, 2023",So much to see! You could spend an entire day here and not see even half of the collections. We went in the late afternoon so our time was limited but the lines were short so the wait time to get in was low. We had a 13 year old boy with us and even he was interested in the artifacts. There is a lot of walking so be prepared for that.,It was okay
"February 9, 2023","Our overall experience was good but, seen as though the only time the staff interacted with anyone was to tell them off. They didn’t know anything about the exhibits or where they are to help you look for certain things. They was only interested in talking to each other and barking at the visitors",British design at its best!
"November 18, 2021",Worth a visit if not just to enjoy the masterful interior design! I am a graphic designer and go just to get inspiration. Not too crowded (Especially these days) and the cafe inside the museum is top notch. Worth a check!,TROY VISIT
"June 21, 2020","I went with my daughter and her daughter to the Troy exhibition last month. We thoroughly enjoyed it, though it could have been better signposted, particularly to make it easier to follow a logical progression. Unlike Sheelagh, as a wheelchair user I found the low setting of the information very handy, as it would also be for younger children!The BM's provision of a wheelchair was much appreciated - without it I could not have visited! - and also that my daughter gained free entry as my carer!It is many decades since I was last at the BM - long before the work on the Central Reading Room. What a superb job the designers did all those years ago! We were able to negotiate the lift up to the café, and would give that 5 stars, not only for the afternoon tea but also for the view!I hope to go again very soon, though not during school holidays, if I can persuade some else other than my daughter to be my carer for the day!",Lovely Museum but packed
"February 24, 2020","Number One suggestion: If you have a 10 am reservation, don't arrive until at least 10:30. The line was wrapped around the block! We went to Starbucks across the street and waited it out.  Bags were searched but oddly enough, no one really looked at or scanned our phone tickets.  Beautiful museum but the end of our trip and I was exhausted and couldn’t walk much.  Hubby viewed some highlights and liked it but everything is spread out into little areas. Lots of walking.  Luckily the atrium is full of benches to take breaks. Thankfully the tickets were free, as we wouldn’t have gotten much value if we paid something.  ",Very busy and not customer friendly
"June 29, 2023","The Museum was packed. Not keen to take my bag in the cloakroom although it was only ten past four and they closed at 5pm. The members' cafe was very nice and quiet for a tea and cake and a big contrast to the hustle and bustle of the museum. Friendly Service. You can only get in there as a member or a guest of a member. The China exhibition seemed a bit lacking in artefacts, it was mostly costumes.",Great place on a rainy day
"September 2, 2023","We enjoyed ourselves visiting the British Museum. It’s an attractive building in and out. Catering facilities are available though the seating by the coffee bar is woefully inadequate. Furthermore the toilets are inadequate for the ladies; there were the inevitable waiting lines. However, the exhibition halls are great. Of course we had to find the highlights - Rosetta Stone, Pantheon friezes and Sutton Hoo. But there’s so much more. You can wander in here for hours. Well worth the visits...and many more.",So much to see!
"October 28, 2022",There is quite a bit to see! You could possibly spend a whole day here if you did the tours or extra exhibits. We had penciled it on for around 4 hours and we still weren't able to see everything but we did get close! Do be aware that some of the exhibits will require tickets and those will sell out in the morning. You'll need a ticket to see the Rosetta Stone.,World's Best Collection
"January 25, 2022","In my opinion probably the world's best collection of artifacts for the public viewing. It has been curated beautifully and definitely has more to see than you can do in one day or maybe even one week! A GPS system would be useful to find your way around although there were people around who could answer questions or provide directions. The disabled access and wheelchair provision were brilliant, including a system of lifts to avoid stairs, even the outside steps.",A treasure trove of ancient civilisations
"July 23, 2023","A very interesting collection of worldly artefacts. Mostly contains early history such as ancient Egypt/Greek/Rome/Celts etc. it’s laid out rather well considering how much there is, over multiple floors with a restaurant, cafe and plenty of gift shops to choose from. Although I thought I knew what I was coming into I was pleasantly surprised to see treasures such as the Rosetta Stone, and Gebelein Man.",Excellent visit.
"August 31, 2020","The BM has always been a family favourite and this visit was no different. We had to pre book entry tickets which were free of charge and easy to do on line. It was fantastic to be able to spend time in uncrowded exhibit rooms, especially the Ancient Egyptian ones. The toilets were open and were spotless and there were refreshments available to buy from the food counter. All in all, another fab visit. ",Rosetta Stone is a must
"October 5, 2022",So much history in one place. Seeing one of the Easter island statues and the Rosetta Stone are two of the coolest things there. Plan almost a full day to even begin to see the museum,Egyptian rooms particularly good
"February 6, 2020","First visit to the British Museum in probably over the 40 years and won't leave it long before I return.  It felt like half of Egypt was in those particular rooms, lots of interesting artefacts.  Also looked at the ancient Greek rooms and some of the Asian ones.  Lots of new information gleaned but too much to take in for one visit, so will be back soon.","Shambolic, Lengthy Queue to Get In"
"October 26, 2023","Don't believe the website saying there is a 2nd entrance in Montague Place.  There's a door but it can't be used to go in.  The queue for the main entrance stretched around the block to Bloomsbury St but was not signposted nor barriered off so people arriving outside the main gates ended up, in effect, trying to jump the (long) queue,  In some cases, this was inadvertent but not always.  The queue was simply to get a cursory bag check.",Nice experience 
"February 6, 2020","The British Museum is a very well organized museum, very interesting stories, and a helpful staff. Very big and clean, everything you need as a first visit is available. Good to go with friends and family. I think 1 hour is fare enough to enjoy it. ",Egyptian Art
"January 27, 2020","We came to see the Rosetta Stone and Parthenon Marbles.  We were most impressed with the Eqyptian hieroglyphics  on a sarcophagus. The layout is easy to understand.  There is plenty of opportunity to donate inside, so don't feel pressure to give at bag check.  Bag check line moved slow so attend early in the day.  ",Egyptian rooms particularly good

"February 8, 2020","We were staying near the British Museum and always like to go there, for exhibitionsor just to be in that grand and historic building. Browsed around the Greek rooms, this time. Savour the history of this Museum. Never disappointed. ",Surrounded by history
"August 12, 2021","Even if you're not too interested in history, this museum is a must visit. Every corner and staircase has some form of ancient history attached to it. You can easily spend hours here. Be aware, some parts may be closed. So if you're looking for a particular section, it'd be wise to ask prior to arrival.",One of the Greatest Museums
"June 18, 2023",It would take weeks to see everything this museum has to offer.  Ask one of the people at the service desk for a recommended itinerary.  The individual we talked to help us plan our visit.  Don't miss visiting this museum.,Nothing in the world compares
"March 9, 2022","To skip visiting the British Museum while in London is to miss out on centuries of history & infinite fascinating exhibits. Whether you want ancient Celtic history, Roman, Greek, Egyptian or contemporary exhibits, you will not be disappointed. The shop is superb as well. Plan to spend the day. There are also fun pubs & shops in the vicinity to indulge your sense of the history of London in other ways. ",Well worth a visit
"July 9, 2021","Went to see an exhibition while visiting London.  Booking process was smooth and easy online.Staff were extremely helpful and welcoming, nice to see a smile on a face. Generally distancing was managed well except for a couple of pinch points in the exhibition  itself - probably due more to the selfishness of visitors who felt the need to stop for a chat at each artefact despite a huge crowd behind them - felt that this could have been better managed by the staff in asking these people to move along and chat away from the exhibits so queues did not develop behind them particularly at the beginning of the display",It is a vast museum
"March 18, 2023","I've visited 3 times over 30  years.I've still not seen much of the content.My advice is to research what you especially wish to see and head to that section until you've done it all.If you love history and wonder at artifacts, one day will not do it all. So many people just aimlessly ambling around- you need to plan to get the best out of a visit.Simply a fantastic place.Nearest tube is Holborn.",Busy free attraction
"November 3, 2023","Exhibits beautiful and worth seeing. Very busy, overwhelming at times around popular exhibits such as the Egyptian Mummies. Massive queues for toilets, so give yourselves extra time. Did not feel overly family friendly on our visit (although a wet day so potentially busier than usual for crowds escaping the weather)Minimal seating in coffee shop (we were just lucky with our timing to sit at a table as soon as someone vacated it) great cake choices to refuel ahead of going back into the crowds. ",Far too busy and crowded 
"August 23, 2023","Don't be fooled into getting a booking time to help the venue control numbers.... Booked and printed tickets, not checked once.Don't go to the 300 metres queue on Gt Russell St, go round to Montague Place and pretty much walk straight in.Far far too busy to enjoy the exhibits due to overcrowding. Extremely annoying getting pushed and shoved by someone simply wanting a photo. Took away most of the reason for the visit, to learn about stuff.Didn't actually see much in there that was actually British!!!A 20th Century Korean teahouse should probably be in a teahouse museum. Wouldn't be going back there in a long time",Must see in London
"December 14, 2022",I liked the museum but organization at entry could be better since it was very busy. We came to see Rosetta Stone and Hieroglyphics exhibition. Loved it. The museum is huge. Definitely need the entire day to see everything.,Ticketing a farse and too many people
"July 22, 2023",You are told you must book a time slot ticket. Yet when you get there there is another queue for those without a ticket and just merges. No one cares or checks your time slot.As a result when you get in the place is heaving. Can't see anything properly and hot with no fresh air.I propose that none UK tourists should pay:1. This may put a good number off and reduce the numbers.2. Plenty will still pay and bring the museum much needed income.The above should apply to ALL London museums.,Always a Treat
"July 3, 2023",Amazing place. On this visit we enjoyed the Money exhibit & the room dedicated to Clocks.  You could spend a month & barely scratch the surface. Note it is very crowded despite the massive scale. Interesting to see some acknowledgement that some of the amazing pieces on display were plundered & returns to their countries of origin are now being negotiated.,See all of the stolen goods
"January 29, 2020","From mummies to Greek statues, there's so much to see in this Museum. I went when they opened to beat the lines and went straight to the Rosetta stone and the Egypt section. The museum store is also very nice and I got some nice eco bags. Shame that these historical artifacts are in Britain and not their home countries.  ",Magical time travel
"March 20, 2022","A chronological tour through Northern European pre- history. The exhibits tell a poignant story, where everything aims at helping us understand the mindset of the hunger gatherers, early farmers, warriors and traders through the ages from before to beyond Stonehenge. If anyone goes with the idea of immersing themselves into the structure of Stonehenge, they'd be disappointed. However, if you are intending to understand the post ice age hunters, early farmers, warriors and traders with their belief system better, this is just magical. We felt in touch with the most elusive of worlds.",Just not our thing.
"June 30, 2023","We had a few hours to kill so thought we’d come here to see a slice of British history. Entirely my fault for not doing my research, but this museum houses artefacts from across the globe.As a consequence I found it all rather tiresome I’m afraid, not helped in the least by the fact it was stiflingly hot owing to many rooms not having air conditioning.Great if global history is your thing. But wasted on someone like me I’m afraid.",A good variety
"January 29, 2023","A good variety of different expositions. Very helpful staff. Visited on Saturday, entry was free. There was too many people so it was hard to get around, especially in Mummy room. There are benches in every room, so  you can sit down and rest. One negative - souvenir shop is really lacking of options! Only few type of souvenirs that are massively overpriced.",Take a Private Tour if You Can!
"January 25, 2022","This was my second visit to the British museum after a gap of 25 years.  My family booked a private tour for me and what a difference it made!  I truly enjoyed my first visit, but it did not compare to the tour I had with my own guide.  I got to see the must-sees on my list, with narrative by my retired classical archaeologist guide, and had the most interesting conversations about the collections.   ",Wonderful Experience
"October 19, 2020",The Egyptian displays are amazing we have visited Egypt many times and been lucky enough to see some of the wonderful sights.This is as good as it gets outside of the relics natural environment. Well worth a visit or two! The building is also amazing and easy to get to.,Great museum - go take a look. 
"January 19, 2020","Wonderful museum, great place to see all the stuff the British have ‘acquired’ from around the world over the years. Rosetta Stone, Egyptian Mummies, Elgin Marbles, and much, much more. Free to get in, maps available. Do some research before you go to plan your visit, as there is so much there, you might want to prioritise the things you want to see. Some exhibitions incur a charge to get in. ",Wow!
"January 9, 2020","This is an absolutely fantastic museum. I was here with my young daughter and my teenage daughter and they both were quite taken with the displays. It is free to enter, which is incredible considering their fabulous collection.You get a chance to see the Rosetta Stone as well as loads of things from ancient Egypt and Greece.  Worth a visit or two!",Regular visit to the British Museum
"February 4, 2020",The British Museum has been my favourite Museum since the age of 7. It's now also my children's favourite.I never fail to feel excited and full of wonder the moment I walk in.Except in the gift shop where my children fleece me.,Great Museum
"September 10, 2022","After my first visit back in 2004, I visited the British Museum 18 years late in 2022 again. Back then, you could just walked it, but times are changing. Entrance is still free, but you have to go through security first. The exhibition is truly outstanding and a whole day is not enough to see everything.",London staple for a rainy afternoon 
"May 17, 2020",I enjoy coming back to the British Museum every once in a while when in London. There is so much to see and always something new to explore. One of my favourite exhibitions is the Egyptian exhibition and it is always very interesting so see. For anyone who is interested in history this is a very good activity in London!,Free entry to observe the history of the world
"October 13, 2023","The goods, bads and ugliesGoods:They have kept all these antiquities in pristine conditions. They deserve all the applause for that. It's a beautiful building and the amount of stuff they have , you need more than 4 hours to cover everything. The entry is free so yes, go visit here.Bads:One of the most sorted destinations in London. So be prepared by the sheer number of people here at any given time. The help desk ain't that helpful and so is the map. My suggestion is to go around and take your time. The signs r better.Uglies:Majority of the exhibits that I saw are taken out of their colonies without permission. India, middle East, Egypt, Australia, other African countries, south American countries. So, it does not give a good vibe to see all these antiquities still in the King's country. It's saddening. And the fact that they don't wanna give back these to their former colonies! Even more blood Boling.Overall, if you are not from GB, go there, and you may find a piece of your history in this museum. That you probably thought never existed. And then be happy that you were allowed to see your own history for free!","Incredible, but too hot"
"August 5, 2022","Utterly fascinating visit, particularly the Egyptian area. Unfortunately, it was so stiflingly hot that we could visit all as we were feeling unwell. Air conditioning or more fans is seriously needed, I am suprised no one fainted.",The day wasn't long enough!
"May 25, 2023","My visit to the British Museum was a highlight of my time in London.  Sure, it's fee if you want to cheap out, but make a sizeable donation.  I believe it is worth it.  There are over 60 galleries and there has to be at least a few that would interest every visitor.  My favs are the Egyption Sculptures, the Greek and Roman Rooms, the nations of MesoAmerica, the Enlightenment, the Money gallery . . . the list is long.  What a beautiful collection!",Interesting insight into Stonehenge.
"March 25, 2022","We visited the Stonehenge exhibition yesterday after we saw a feature in our local paper that said the exhibition also included finds from Must Farm, near Peterborough. It was the latter that prompted us to visit. Unfortunately the paper over- hyped  the Must Farm exhibits and in reality there were only two small cases of exhibits in the very large exhibition, which we found disappointing. Overall, the exhibition was very interesting  and is worth a visit to give a wider perspective of Stonehenge, involving other countries.  One other point is that the layout of the exhibition is not great and other visitors were totally ignoring social distancing and diving in, within a few inches of faces. Not good and not comfortable !",Free!
"January 1, 2020","Still cannot believe this place is free. We spent a good full day here, with lunch in between. If you want to avoid the crowds, I would advise getting here 20 prior to opening and then once the doors open, make your way to the top galleries. People tend to start of on the lower levels and make their way up.",Spectacular Museum. 
"September 7, 2023",This is free and truly you cannot miss this so awesome so much to see give yourself at least 3 hours. The Egyptian section is like wow and wow. Everything we saw was amazing. Great photo opportunities and big gift shop.,Exhibits from practically every part of the world 
"November 10, 2022","We spent practically the whole day on  Sunday there,- reaching at about 11am and only leaving when it closed at 5pm. There is so much to see. It provides a snapshot of practically the whole world as there are exhi its from all the continents and most regions of the world. Truly an educational and eye opening experience. Very tired at the end of the day but it was well worth it being on my feet the whole time visiting the numerous rooms. ",One of the World's Great Museums
"April 11, 2022","What can I say, its the British Museum.  One of the world's great museums.  The Greek, Roman, and Egyptian artefacts are impressive.  The Elgin Marbles are unique...but should be returned to Greece, no?    Very good section on Sutton Hoo - and it's British, so no issues with it :)    Everything is well laid out, explanations are good.  A true learning experience.  And its free (but you are encouraged to leave a donation).",Meet me at the Museum
"March 6, 2020","Every time I return to London to visit family, the Museum is always on my to do list. This year I couldn’t believe the queues to get in, so I ended up going later in the day. Such a sad thing to be bagged checked at this great institution but alas it’s the sign of the times. Once in, we’ll go to the top floor and work your way down. For me it’s the Egyptian Rooms every time. I feel the despair within the sarcophagus’ - I connect with the sense of life within the glass cabinets.Always an enjoyable time at the BM.",Awesome
"January 5, 2020",The museum itself is amazing to visit and look at the architecture. Their collection is just as great. My only complaint would be how seeing the Roseta Stone was managed. Very pushy crowds and chaotic from the moment it opened. Wonderful over wise and excellent shop inside the museum.,A building to view.
"October 15, 2023","The museum building itself is quite magnificent and intimidating in a good way. There is undoubtedly a lot to see and 3 or 4hrs is not enough. However, I did gind it difficult to navigate and whilst the rooms were numbered I found it a bit chaotic and it spoiled my visit which I was really looking forward to.. ","fascinating exhibits, well displayed, easy layout."
"March 31, 2023","great visit on Wednesday before Easter hols. some great books in the shop. the tea at the cafe is excellent. loves the Assyria, Ancient Egypt, China, India and Africa galleries - although Africa gallery was a bit limited and also very hot. Only wish we'd had a bit more time as there was lots more to see. Could do with more toilets as very busy, and better signage to the toilets as one sign took us on a wild goose chase.",Ok kind of day
"August 11, 2021","A very impressive building; we were asked to pre book time slots, why I don’t know, no check of you ticket on arrival just follow a queue, have your bag checked and in you go. Popped for a coffee first which was slow and badly organised for service. Exhibition space is huge and one you could quite easily spend days at. However I found the layout very confusing trying to work out if you start left, or right. How everything works and links together and I must say still don’t get the curating set up. Some very interesting facts but would of liked more interpretations of the contents of the cases. After a couple of hours it all felt very similar and we Called it a day. We did have a lunch, can’t Daly the food quality which was good, service again was questionable and certainly having to wait for drinks was not great. Will be back but not for a while",VERY BIG Hard layout to find things
"February 6, 2023","We went on a Saturday in January. This place is HUGE and there aren't enough bathrooms! It was VERY VERY busy, but for the most part, you didn't have to wait long to get close to a case to view. I didn't see any recognizable staff to ask questions as to how to get from place A to B!  It really was a bit overwhelming - only ended up staying  a couple hours and that was enough.",So much to see.
"August 18, 2023","How can you NOT go here!  It's got a little bit of everything.  The Rosetta Stone, an Easter Island statute, coins dating longer back to you can guess.  It's terribly impressive.  It is, however, extremely crowded.  The lines for restrooms (for men) FLY by, but the lines for restrooms for women are at a snail's pace.  Mind that.",A must in your list
"May 13, 2023","Stunning museum, my partner and me needed hours to see every item and admire every culture. History, science, architecture, sculpture, jewelry and so much more. You need more than only one day to see and admire every part of this wonderful museum, one of my favorites.",Set the tone for our London vacation
"March 8, 2023","Our first full day in London, began with the British museum, which was just an absolute delight! Stunning way to start a visit in London, beautiful beautiful museum reminded us of the Metropolitan Art Museum in New York, but deeper older history! We all loved it!",No Organization but Cool Stuff
"May 31, 2022",I did not understand the way that the exhibits we're organized. However once we found what we wanted to see it was neat. It was beyond crowded so I can't even believe what it's like on a weekend. Maybe if you get there when it first opens for the day you'll have a bit of peace?,Go later in day….  AM the q is enormous!
"December 8, 2022","Go later in the day. Our accommodation was stayed close by and noticed no q in the afternoon. When we originally wanted to go, at 10.30am the q is enormous!  Like a massive q a block away before even getting in q outside main entrance. Museum does stay open later on a Friday. Other days it shuts at 5pm. It’s been said before….  The building itself is a beauty and we loved Egyptian exhibit.",Amazing
"January 23, 2020",The British Museum is fabulous. Between the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles you can’t help but be impressed. So much to see and no admission fee. Just ask for a donation.

"February 11, 2020","I think I saw more well preserved mummies in London than in Egypt. This is a fascinating museum to visit. But you must get there hours before it opens -- in order to assure yourself the self-audio tour. The details within the audio are worth the purchase. Every time I go to England, I must take a trip to British Museum. ",Go if you want it o do an activity indoors
"August 18, 2022",The building and architecture was splendid. But I was honestly expecting more grand items on display. Levels with exhibitions very tightly spaced Areas felt claustrophobic and lacking in air conditioning. We went on a very hot day.  Food very pricey but plenty of seats for resting throughout the levels.,Fascinating exhibitions
"April 14, 2022","There is always something new to see in the museum.  Prepare to spend most of the day there so you can cover all areas.  Fascinating exhibitions, and something for everyone.

"January 14, 2020","As it is broken down into eras and dynasties,  and it is easy to follow the progress of nations. Be prepared for a lot of walking as the place is huge, and on many floors. But have an interest in history and archeology or it may be wasted on you. It could take all day to walk around, but after about 2 hours we had overloaded.",Terrible Covid safety
"June 1, 2021",I travelled here for the much lauded Thomas Becket exhibition. As I write I am in a non socially distanced queue for the ladies toilets. You will tell me it is up to people to judge and decide but let me tell you until they are lying in their 2 metre length coffins they don’t know what 2 metres is - I mean they’d have to be very tall....the exhibition was marred by people pushing ahead (oh look a woman has just pushed ahead of me on the stairs to the toilet and I’m not yet dead and fairly fit...) - whilst your guides sit there  and look peaceful. Quite frankly I want my money back. My own workplace is a great deal more secure than this. And don’t gee me started on cultural appropriation.,Long lines everywhere
"April 25, 2022","Be prepared to wait for hours in line to get in even with free tickets for a specific time. The line was 2 blocks long, no accommodations for disabled folks. Every venue in London was crowded with long wait times and expensive.  Add 30% to your budget to visit London.",Disappointed
"September 16, 2021","Interesting as usual. However security guard was quite unreasonable. We left some of our party to go and have lunch that they had brought on the greenery by the main entrance. We then went in search of food, on the assumption that we would just rejoin them. However once we had got food, the security guard did not let us through the gate, saying we'd have to rejoin the queue for the security checks in. Clearly it wasn't as obvious to them as it was to me that they could have simply checked our bags then and there and let us through. As we were quite literally holding food, there was no way the security check would have let us in. Instead we had to leave and go somewhere else. All and in, I would not recommend trying to go and come back with food",Great Collection
"March 21, 2020",Great Collection of some of the best of every country / culture. Especially Asia and Greek collection of my personal interest. Free entry (donation suggested). Assuming normally there's a lineup. we were lucky that there wasn't when we visited. ,Well worth a visit
"May 13, 2023","The wealth of exhibits and the fact that it is free make this a must-see whenever you visit London.  The crowds can be a bit much, so that that timing can be important.

"January 16, 2023",Visited in January 2023 with family.Advisable to book free tickets in advance. There is a separate ques for people with booked tickets.You can get a free map from the reception and visit the attractions according to time you have. There are “not to be missed” exhibits mentioned in the map.Egypt section is the most crowded one.Kids enjoyed the displays.Great way to have fun and informative day out with family.,Great big museum but almost too big!
"March 28, 2022","Went to the museum yesterday with a few friends, I had been before but had completely forgotten how big it was and how much was crammed inside. There's so much to see that in future I would probably choose to do it on two separate times instead of all at once. Fantastic place though.",Fantastic museum well worth the visit 
"December 4, 2022","The British museum is full of the most magnificent treasures, form across the millennia. There are some stunning pieces in an equally stunning building. I always try and visit when I'm in London as there is so much to see, you need a few trips. ",The British Museum
"May 14, 2022",Great museum. Their antiquity collection is one of the best. This time went thru the Egyptian rooms (the second floor mummies section is mostly closed for renovation though) and Mesopotamian exhibit.,The equivalent of the Louvre in London
"March 2, 2023","I did three of the free guided visits. I loved the last one: Ancient Rome (at 15:15). David was articulate and engaging. He gave us a recap of the Roman Empire in around 40 minutes. It was very my favourite out of the three guided visits I did. One of the best museums I’ve been in London so far ! Definetely recommend to come if you have at least 2 hours. There’s so much to see, you need to  do several visits.",Great but avoid if you have an allergy.
"March 4, 2023","Museum is amazing, but ultimately too big to try and do in one visit. The map also isn’t very clear/easy to work out. Main issue was with the catering facilities in the museum. No allergy information is shown on the counter but there are signs reassuring allergy sufferers that they only need to ask and they will be helped. Allegedly.I asked at the counter and the server said she thought two of the cakes were gluten free but that she would check. She went to a colleague who who filling the fridge and asked. His response was, ‘we’re too busy. Just tell him we don’t know and we can’t find out because the manager isn’t here’. I found this quite rude to be honest, and can’t believe that the eateries don’t have an allergen menu to hand. It’s an accident waiting to happen…",Good to be back
"September 11, 2020",Reduced lower ground route available. Well organised entry and visit. Staff visibly cleaning seating areas. Enjoyed being back to visit one of my favourite places.,Thousands of years of World's History in one place.
"February 18, 2020","The British Museum is definitely a must see. Free entrance since the opening day, it is an absolute moving experience. Browsing throught history, room by room, is riveting.  Rosetta Stone and the Partenon are, of course, masterpieces, but they are not the only one. Every time I visit here, I am amazed. And the staff is kind, professional and helpful. Don't miss this jewel!",Best museum in the world 
"May 3, 2022","Love the BM...so mych of interest for everyone. Went this time for the Stonehenge exhibition which was interesting but a little disjointed in its presentation we found. I would also question some of the ""facts"" ..however the artefacts were excellent",Impressive but crowded
"July 26, 2023","Visited 24th of july. The crowds here were no joke. The Rosette's Stone and the Eqyptian section is the death zone. The exhibitions were impressive and vast, but less from what the Natural History Museum and V&A Museum had to offer. Would recommend for someone interested in history and archeology.",Awesome place
"January 7, 2020","This place reminded me of Louvre, with so many things to see.  Best of all, it's free to get in.  We only spend 3 hours there, but you can easily spend days if you want.  My kids enjoyed the Rosetta Stone and other Egyptian antiquity items.","Amazing place, cold spend weeks here!"
"February 25, 2020","Absolutely incredible. We went to see the Rodin Exhibition and it was an absolute marvel. The size of the place is a signt to behold and the structure itself well worth a visit, but there's always so mcu to see you will keep going back.",Not enough time!
"January 1, 2022","Two hours flew by!  I wished we spent 4 hours minimum.  Semi-private tour is worth the investment.  Our tour guide, Becky, basically grew up at this museum.  And it showed.  Well done, kid.",Tea
"April 3, 2020","Yup they sell tea and scones,  the service was quick and effective . There's a few places for refreshments  in the museum and the balcony bar wasn't the ideal location, but it punctuated my visit. looking at all those  plundered empire goodies and the Japanese gallery. ",Don't try to do it all in one visit
"August 2, 2023","Try to figure out in advance what you want to see. There is so much, that it takes many, many visits to take it all in. If you have a chance, take a guided tour of what interests you.Seeing how much and what the British have ""acquired"" made me better understand the discussion about returning precious artefacts to the original countries.",Went to visit our parthenon marbles
"February 4, 2023",Amazing museum. Huge. You need a full day. Only downside was the room the Parthenon marbles is in was freezing! Why? Nice cafe. Helpful staff. Pay for the audio tours it is worth it. ,Family trip to the capital
"February 8, 2020","Fabulous time had here with a 13 year old and 8 year old. So much to see that we could have easily spent the day here. Cafe is reasonably priced, and some great gift and book shops. Love the place. We will return! 😍",It is a big museum! Worth your time
"March 16, 2023",This museum is true to its marketing - it is big! Take your time to visit all the halls and exhibitions. The bathrooms were clean during the December tourist season and the curio shop is packed with good quality items. Well worth your time and definitely a must see.,Great with kids
"May 24, 2022","We had prebooked a ticket but it wasn't checked, just bags searched. Place was huge, we arrived about 2 hours before closing and think I saw half of it. Since my kid had ancient Europe just thought in school we mainly focused on that. 2 hours was enough for that. Collection is huge and stunning, although I'm not sure about the morality of some of the artifacts. I recommend plan ahead of what to see and where things are located.",So much to see
"March 6, 2020","One of my top three. Very detailed exhibits with great pieces. Well laid out to follow progression of cultures. Not such good layout when switching between cultures. Rosetta Stone, Elgin marbles, mummies.Chinese history, Rome just a few. Had a large room entitled the Enlightenment that I could spend a year in.",2nd visit 
"February 26, 2020","Absolutely amazing, but probably need 2 days to see all. Well organised, very busy but didn’t feel too crowded. Plenty of washrooms (always important). Amazingly foc to enter but donations gratefully accepted. ",Family Visit
"February 22, 2020","A great day out, to much to do in one day so we got a map and took 10 minutes to choose which parts we wanted to look at. Good facilities and very clean toilets. Free to get in but there are places to make a donation. Free WiFi. Will definitely go back.",The food is the only thing in the British Museum that is british!
"September 11, 2021","There isn't a wide variety of fare but it is perfectly adequate. What one would expect from a small catering unit in a public museum. Good staff. As well as the usual faddish, false milks there is also proper full-fat milk! Now being offered that is ancient!",Amazing!
"February 21, 2023","They didn’t check our ticket and was no sign of how they were managing numbers that entered. Place was packed in some areas (Egyptian) and others weren’t too bad. There is so much to see, you could spend a week there. I will definitely return to see more ","free venue, make sure you give donation"
"August 8, 2021","lovely staff, on top of things (we did a naughty thing and they came over straight away and politely told us to not stand in that place). big place and very busy and full of loads of things. only reason I have given a 4* and no 5* is there is no canteen for food or otherwise a sweet/drink shop inside. I understand it may be as do not want people walking around with sticky/dirty fingers but when you re with children it is a problem that they want something to drink or eat. ",Amazing Museum
"June 24, 2020","As a history lover, I really enjoyed the museum. There's everything from the Egyptians, to the Greeks, to the Mesopotamians, Chinese and many more. It's a worldwide history tour. And the Rosetta Stone is a must-see even if there's always a lot of people around it.Would highly recommend.",Good day at museum
"March 26, 2023","So much to see for kids and adults alike. Egyptian mummies , tombs . Greek sculptures were amazing. The Chinese jade collection. The Samarai suit in Japan section with sword . Amazing. Had two course lunch in great court restraunt . Food was great sitting right up in roof , good service . Make sure you book on line very busy .",What a treat!
"March 2, 2020",We hadn't planned on going here while on our short visit to London. We had only 2 hours to spare and took a walk to this lovely place and we were so happy we did. Easy security lines and a bustling atmosphere is a beautifully laid out space. Wonderful exhibits with something for everyone in our family. Don't miss it!,MUST VISIT
"January 4, 2020",I think that everyone knows that they must go to this museum when they visit London.  My suggestion is to plan what you want to see and not get distracted but all the things you could see.  The library to the right of the entrance often gets overlooked because everyone goes left to the RS and Elgin Marbles.  It had curios that were really interesting.  ,One of the best museum I saw ever
"March 5, 2020","Huge huge museum, beats even Louvre in size of gallerys. It's all free majorly, some special areas need ticket. However, you need a whole day to capture all of its offering. This is not a 1/2 hr visit place.",Stonehenge and more
"May 6, 2022",Went to the World of Stonehenge exhibition. Much wider than just Stonehenge and interesting to see the extent of trade going on at that time. Lots of exhibits on loan from other countries. Imaginative exhibition with atmospheric soundtrack playing. Highly recommended.,A good couple of hours to have in London
"March 4, 2022","A variety of eras and civilisations covered in an easy to walk building. You can walk room to room, slipping from one era to another, with plenty to have a look at.It can be, if I being honest, a little disconnected in how the different timelines are situated on the main floor. However, if you just keep on walking, you’ll hit everything no matter the order.",Makes me proud to be British. So long as you dont think too hard about how we got a lot of the stuff here.... 
"July 18, 2022",Awesome. An amazing collection of exhibits from all around the world.Suitable for a quick trot round or a full day (or more) of exploration.Massively busy when I visited on a Friday midday but thats to be expected for such a unique place.,Awesome
"September 14, 2021","If you enjoy museums then this is an absolute must.  While I didn’t spend too much time here as I had a prior engagement, but what I did see was incredible.  There is no cost but you need to book a time slot on the website.  Very clean and tidy and items well preserved and nicely spaced out.  There are plenty of clean toilets as well as coffee shops and souvenir shops.  Be prepared to spend a few hours here! Definitely worth a visit,",Not only for rainy days
"September 28, 2020",Fantastic collection for adults and children alike. you can go 100 times and you have still not seen everything.  The building with his atrium is already worth a visit. Take a look into the old reading room. Very good exhibitions - well curated!,Great place
"September 3, 2021","Huge museum, spread over many floors. They have an excellent Ancient Egypt section, but its a bit scary to see the mummies.lovely toilet areas, nice shop (although a bit busy). Really enjoyed our time here",Nice discovery...!
"December 18, 2023",Interesting place where you can discover the history of different culture / people ... the Egyptian zone it's interesting and other areas too.. the small coffee/restaurant area upstairs was nice too serving good food. Thea revive was ok too. We paid around 25 eur each . To visit,Great Exhibit
"July 12, 2022","Came with my wife to see the feminine power exhibit and honestly it was great. Learnt a lot and was very impressed with what they've put together for the exhibit. We then went around the rest of the museum and loved every minute of it! Especially the Egyptian and Phoenician sections. Very much my field, and I always love how well curated they are!",A true gem!
"October 13, 2022",Lovely museum with lots of exhibits. We went there to see the Rosetta stone but unfortunately they only had the replica. The museum is very spacious and easy to navigate. The dining area was under these wonderful glass ceilings which we thoroughly enjoyed. We only covered a third of it but hope to visit it again. Admission is free so that is a plus!!,It would take you days and days to run out of things to see
"August 2, 2022","The diversity of exhibits is almost overwhelming.  Large, well -lit spaces with beautifully curated rooms. Crowds well-managed; plenty of staff available to answer questions.  Reading between the pages, the exhibits from Greece, Egypt and the ancient near east make clear the hubris of British collectors who, during the halcyon years of the Empire, stripped those countries of their antiquities. As unsettling as it is beautiful.","Wonderful museum, but confusing layout"
"March 22, 2022","This is a world-famous museum for many reasons.  In general, the displays are easy to understand.  However, it is not always easy to find the room you are looking for.  We kept missing the room about Mexico, and finally discovered it was closed, though no reason was given.  We concentrated on British history and were fascinated by all of the objects found all over the country.  I thought the gift and book stores were great and I absolutely loved the afternoon cream tea!  Best scones I’ve ever had!",Couple of days worth!!
"January 28, 2020","There is *so* much to see!! Definitely plan your visit, get a hold of a map/collections. This museum is HUGE, as are the incredible collections.  Just the Egyptian collection is enough to keep you mesmerized for a while. One tip, though--avoid the weekends. ",Such a stunning collection of history!
"November 17, 2022","I enjoyed visiting the museum but did not have the time to do it justice.  The rooms are full of amazing icons and tidbits of history.  Soak it in and learn.  I loved seeing all the crosses, the tools from long ago, the cultural items...... just fascinating. ",Excellent museum and exhibition
"October 9, 2022",Absolutely love this  museum which is a beautiful building to wander around in even before seeing any of the exhibitions. Attended the new hieroglyphics exhibition which was outstanding. The curator's talk was excellent and really helped to make sense of the exhibits and put them into context. There is a mixture of large and small items and the history of how Egyptian writings were deciphered and the process was absolutely fascinating. Would like to return to visit some of the other exhibits. Was very privileged to have seen this exhibition. Highly recommend.,Great for the whole family
"March 25, 2022","A wonderful afternoon at an historic institution.  My kids liked the mummies, of course, but also enjoyed the Roman and British artifacts.  We spent a lot of time in the Mesopotamia area as well.  The personal library in cuneiform combining about doing homework or getting a baby to sleep was priceless.  The courtyard cafes were also great for a break with the littles between exhibits.",Great day out
"November 1, 2021","Absolutely brilliant, still as good as when I was younger, now I get to enjoy how great it is with my child. So fantastic to be able to go to London again and we have the best museums. Staff are really helpful and friendly, very clean and safe environment. Everything was perfect, great day out.",NERO EXHIBITION
"August 13, 2021",This is one of the best exhibitions we've been to at the BM with a range of well-explained and presented artifacts providing an alternative look at one of Rome's most well-known emperors. Informative and laid out so that it was accessible to those in wheelchairs. An excellent couple of hour's worth!,A fabulous museum in the heart of London
"June 5, 2022","One of the best museums I’ve ever seen.  Very impressive collection of Greek, Roman and Egyptian artifacts. It also is home to the Rosetta Stone-which I found to be absolutely incredible. So much to see and the museum is free to enter. ","Great exhibits, tea service is ok"
"May 16, 2022","We went there for afternoon tea and then saw a few of the exhibits. It is free. Tea was tasty, service was ok. Our waitress spilled Prosecco all over me and my husband. Accidents happen, but it was uncomfortable. The location for tea was noisy. Would not go for tea there again even though the food was nice, would have preferred a more Intimate setting.",Great exhibition
"June 16, 2022",We went specifically to see the Stonehenge exhibition which was very good with some fantastic artefacts. Far more emphasis on the people and contemporaneous sites - rather than the building of Stonehenge itself. Good to go at opening time on a weekday - when likely to be less busy.,One Could Spend a Few Days Here
"January 1, 2023","We visited twice during our Xmas holiday week in London.  It can be tiring to try to hit everything in one shot.  Lots of stuff to see, I'm sure there is a lot more in storage not for public viewing.  A must see for sure if you are in London.","Never mind the artefacts, stunning building"
"July 30, 2021","We visited just prior to journey home and had not left a lot of time.  What an amazing place.  The building itself is amazing.  Amazing to see Roman, Viking, Egyptian history.  When I visit again will put half a day aside to visit.  Thank you to staff for being helpful and safe as London gets back to normal, great job.",British Museum 15.12.20
"December 15, 2020","Decided to book a visit before we go into tier three(who knows when that will end!).This is my second visit(last one in September).Followed the one way system and was there for 2 and half hours.I prefer the system at the Vand A,where you can go wherever you like without any restrictions.",Big amazing place.
"August 25, 2021",Was a great day but be aware there is a lot to see.  Don’t spend to much time on the bottom floor get upstairs there’s so much more to see.  U could spend all day there brilliant just like the whole of London.  Breathtaking ,Another enjoyable visit to the British Museum.
"April 17, 2018","Although we have visited many times, we just had to go in again while we were in London.  I find this museum very interesting and educational and always make a bee-line for the ancient Egyptian and Greek displays. Once again, we had a very enjoyable visit.  The British Museum is a ‘must see’ if you are in London; there is something for everyone and it’s free!","very large, free, totally perfect!"
"December 12, 2011",This place is extremely interesting and big. There are many things to see and it takes you maybe 2 days to see it all! very big and incredible place.,A magnificent repository of the world's wonders
"May 30, 2018","The British Museum is a special place in the world, where history and culture have been collected and curated for over a century, and where an unmatched set of artifacts exist and are protected and displayed for nearly free. On this level, one can give thanks for the opportunity to come here. For almost nothing, you can see many wonders of the world. On the financial level, I donated the requested 2 pounds based on the sign on the first floor...they asked for 5 pounds on the 3rd floor! Don't forget to donate some money if you are able.Finally, if you are inclined, you might want to consider the politics and ethics of archeology. Museums (and British museums in particular) in the West have come under fire for taking things from other countries and bringing them to the West. At the obvious level, that is exactly what happened to some of these artifacts. I would suggest that one think about the preservation and display that has occurred, as well as the easy-to-criticize expropriation. I myself would be in favor of returning some of these items to the countries where they originated, if they have functioning museums and the ability to preserve the items. However, many of the nations that created these items are no longer in existence, and the great British archeologists and explorers that found them and preserved them deserve at least one cheer for saving them from the fate of too many historical artifacts. In the last decade, entire tableau of irreplaceable elements of ancient history have been destroyed in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq...to name a few of the cases that are known. The Rosetta stone, lest we forget, was once installed into a wall of a fort, and only later became preserved and studied the world over. Shall it be repatriated to Egypt? This is a question to consider at length. If you do so after seeing the benefits of its preservation, realize the benefit you have received before rendering judgement.",A Joke of a place
"January 29, 2016","The Museum as a British Institution of artefacts that have been 'rescued' or generally just plundered by the British, is a beautiful place. Yet the most important facet of the Museum is the people. Of course you may find those in Galleries a little bit strict or the Box office staff a tad enthusiastic. But i think those who made my visit at the museum the most strenous and slightly embarrassing on their part  was the main managers/ supervisors. Watching them deal with a woman having a fainting fit in the Celts exhibition reminded me of something out of an old Benny Hill movie. One man saundered out of nowhere dressed in an outfit that even a politician wouldn't wear to work- Spats that clearly look out of place unless he decided to break into dance, he looked at the lady in question, nodded quietly to himself then saundered away almost hitting himself against a door. meanwhile the first aid staff were sufficient in helping the lady up and getting her to a first aid room. The box office staff were really nice and reassured the rest of us entering the exhibition that everything would be alright. However other supervisors who were there still chatting as the woman was on her way out of the exhibition decided to have an impromptu laughing session about the heating. I'm not a judge of character but clearly having a person who just fainted in front of you, the last thing you need is a senior staff acting like the three stooges (another tv reference) This was mostly because one of them had a weird hairstyle and Mr Spats returned to see the lady led out. I mean seriously, you have people like that in charge, it is an odd sort of management.",The best museum in London and it’s free!
"June 30, 2017","We popped into the British Museum again for a short visit while we were in London.  We always find something of interest whenever we go there - you never have time to see everything in one visit, it is just not possible.The museum is separated into sections for various regions of the world.  There are so many treasures on display here which were ‘collected’ by the British from all over the world.  I particularly liked the ancient Egyptian and ancient Greek displays, they are simply amazing. The British Museum is definitely worth a visit if you are in London and it’s free!",Fascinating
"February 5, 2004","While the arrangement of exhibits is a big eccentric, I find that to be a good part of the museum's charm. Seeing the Rosetta Stone a room or so away from the Elgin marbles (and both on the ground floor!) was fascinating. The new ""King's library"" exhibit, demonstrating the age of enlightenment's awakening to a true study of the past is a unique insight into how the Victorians and pre-Victorians viewed their world as well as that of others.As to crowds, we found that going late in the afternoon on Thursday or Friday (when its open until late) was the best way to avoid the multitude (who seem to leave about 4 heading to tea).",Storehouse of History
"April 9, 2004","The British Museum is one of the most fascinating experiences in London. I visited the Museum on the first Friday of April for four hours in the late afternoon and early evening. The Reading Room in the center of the Museum is incredibly beautiful and historically significant; the new enclosure surrounding it is stunning. The Museum's collections are fabulous - I only saw the Roman, Roman Britain and the Medieval areas during my brief visit. You should plan to see only a small portion of the collections during your visit - plan ahead and you'll have a great time. The shops and the cafe were also very good!",Best Museum Ever for History Lovers
"October 7, 2008","I'm a history fan and this museum is not going to be of much interest to those who are not fans of history.  So...take my review for what it's worth as a novice history fan.  Toured in September, 2008.The British Museum is a FREE museum and also open into the evening on Thursdays and Fridays.  Located within a few blocks of a couple tube stops.  Have audio tours.  Has a cafeteria on main floor and a nicer sit down restaurant on the upper floor.  Couple gift shops.Yes, it has its controversies, but from a pure “want to see as much as you can in one place” type of vacation I was on when there, it could not be beat.  Should it return some of the items it acquired at the height of the British Empire to the countries they were removed from?  I don’t know.  There are two sides to every story but after a visit to the Museum, I can certainly see why some countries want some items back.  They have been incredibly preserved and taken care of and are priceless.  Another reason it’s the best museum ever?  You can take photos.  I do love museums where you can take photos.  It's a huge museum.  The courtyard is beautiful as well.Here are some of the items I saw that were on my favorite list:Rosetta Stone:  Stunning.  One of the most important pieces of history ever.  Discovered in 1799 it is of great importance because it broke the code of Egyptian hieroglyphics which had been lost over time.  On the Rosetta Stone is the same paragraph/decree written in hieroglyphic, Egyptian script and Egyptian cursive.  This allowed for the hieroglyphics to be translated again.  Huge breakthrough.  The Stone is broken and not complete.  It's under glass and always surrounded by people so hard to get a great photo.  Make sure you turn off your flash to try to cut down on the reflection.  Stunning.Cyrus Cylinder:  The so-called Cyrus Cylinder is believed to be the first document on human rights.  Dates to 539 B.C. and was an order issued by Cyrus the Great that states his respect for the religious and political traditions of his conquered lands (in this case Babylonia).  Could be propoganda so take it for what it's worth.Parthenon Sculptures:  Date back to 5th Century B.C.  HUGE room at the Museum containing a number of pieces from the Parthenon.  This is also one of the controversial displays as Greece wants them back because they are an important part of their history.  The Brit’s side is that if they would not have taken them, they would be destroyed like the rest of the Parthenon.  Incredible pieces of history regardless.Halikarnassos Mausoleum:  One of seven wonders of the world.  So important to see since so many of the wonders have been lost.  There are several remnants of the tomb of Maussollos (where the word mausoleum comes from) who ruled Halikarnassos in 4th Century B.C. Cleopatra’s Body:  You see her mummy.  Apparently, the modern day analysis they can do shows she was very attractive.  The Museum has a very large Egypian collection.  Several other mummies also on display as well as other items.Amarna letters:  Clay tablets of correspondence between Egypt and other kings and queens.  They date back to 14th Century B.C.!Crystal Skull:  Saw the fake crystal skull (those who have seen the latest Indy movie will hear him talk about it).  At first, the skull was thought to be an ancient artifact but over time it was found to be a hoax created with modern tools.  Still cool to see.Classicianus’ tombstone:  The British minister appointed by the Roman emperor Nero.  His tombstone dates back to 1st Century A.D.Alexander the Great:  Marble portrait of Alexander the Great which dates back to around 2nd Century B.C.  Good looking guy.Sutton Hoo Ship Burial:  Anglo-Saxon burial tomb pieces which date back to 7th Century A.D. Flood Tablet:  Clay tablet telling the story of the Babylonian flood.  Dates to 7th Century B.C.  Ramesses the Great:  Bust of Ramesses II dating back to 1270 B.C.  The Ramesses line were responsible for the construction of the pyramids.  Nereid Monument:  Turkish tomb dating back to 390 B.C.  It is believed to have been broken up by an earthquake and is put back together at the Museum in a way they think makes sense.  Assyrian Gateway Figures:  Huge figures dating back to 710 B.C.  Made of marble.  Very big.  Assyria is now in what we call Iraq.  There are 5 at the British Museum and they adorned entrances and buildings.  There are also several Assyrian reliefs at the Museum dating back to 7th Century B.C.  Easter Island:  One of the Easter Island statues is at the Museum.  Looks just like you think it will!I spent several hours at the Museum and want to go back again some day.  I had a list of things I wanted to see and that was really the only way you can tour the Museum in any kind of limited capacity.  I hope to go back again and be able to really wander and see more of the treasures this Museum holds.",Slightly Disappointing
"September 20, 2003","After all the wonderful things that I had heard about this museum, I was rather disappointed at its actual content. The things that they do have are rather amazing and impressive, but the manner in which they are laid out does not seem to necessarily be the best possible way to me. Many things seem to be very spread apart with not quite enough explanation unless you rent a headset to guide you or have your own guide with you. Definitely the best part of the museum for me were the Greek and Roman rooms, but other than that, it felt as if we needed a guide just to tell us where to go first or how exactly to make the best use of our time there.",Wonderful Museum 
"November 21, 2022","The British museum is one of the best I have ever been in so many artifacts to see & so little time to do it. You could spend weeks  there and  not see it all, well worth the experience.",Seriously needs to review its policy on drinking water!
"July 26, 2015","I visited the British Museum with entire Primary School year group on one of the hot summer days. The pupils had brought water bottles, but naturally the galleries were very hot and very crowded. I went to the toilets to refill the pupil's water bottles for them and found the drinking water sign on the wall but the drinking fountain panelled off. I asked a security guard where the drinking fountains were and he said there were two outside. I walked all the way outside to find the drinking fountains broke. I went to the information desk and asked where the drinking water was and I was informed the fountains were broken and they only provided bottled water for sale in the shop! The children had to go without, I was not about to buy 120 bottles of water! We left instead!I think this is a disgrace. There are those on social media up in arms against the CEO of Nestle saying he does not believe clean drinking water is a human right, and now I find the British Museum in the same camp. Pure commercial opportunism - outrageous.",Frustrating left-luggage rules
"February 10, 2013","This is not a criticism of the British Museum itself nor of its exhibits which are, of course, world-class.Be warned though that if, like us, you have checked out of your hotel and are on your way to a station or the airport with a suitcase, you may be refused entry to the building or will have to take stuff out of your case to bring its weight down to 8 kg. The excess items will then be put into a plastic basket and you will be charged another £1.50.The British Library has a left-luggage facility where you can leave a suitcase, so why can't the British Museum have one?",Audio tour for faster people
"September 16, 2008","There are at least two different types of museum people:- The sort that read every card and truly delve into the mysteries of the past.  They ask deep questions and want to know history- The sort that prefer to proceed quickly through and ""see"" everything, reading the cards for things that interest them, skipping entire rooms if the contents do not appeal.If you are the later, as I am, do not schedule the in-person highlights tour.  Do the audio highlights tour instead IMO. I did both tours in a recent visit to London.  I found myself listening to an incredibly knowledgable guide (14 years at the museum) talk slowly through each nuance of a single piece of history. That is great, but I also about died when we walked by the Rosetta stone and saw 4 people in front of it. Yes, only 4.  We were going in a specific order, so the fact that there would be 50 people later did not (nor should it have) phase our guide one bit.So, we switched to the audio tour. It said the same thing (basically)!  Wow, we were happy. We heard almost the same depth of knowledge, but could approach a piece of history, enter a number, hear the dialogue, then proceed quickly to the next artifact, even room. We saw the entire museum in about 3 hours. We went to every room that was open, and listened to every ""highlight"".  The museum is amazing and incredible.  I especially like the occasional photos beside items of when they were preparing the item for shipment to Britain.  It made it come alive that these items truly came from somewhere, and it took a lot to get them to England.One hint, sometimes the audio tour line in the main lobby is huge.  Go back by the Parthenon area and get the same headsets there with no line.  You do need to leave photo ID to get a headset.",Heaven for history buffs!
"May 20, 2006","The British Museum was one of my Must-Do's for London and I was not disappointed at all.  For years, I'd wanted to see the things like the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon and the Rosetta Stone and other Egyptian artifacts in person and they were amazing!  A definite don't miss in my book.  Also, I donated a few pounds (even though it's free to enter) just to do my part in maintaining such an awesome collection.  It's worth it!",The British Museum - a must see!
"January 11, 2019","This is one of the great museums of the world - a must see if just for the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles.  You enter through the very impressive Great Court and the scene is set to be overwhelmed by the treasures contained in this museum.My first time there I was lucky enough to be invited on a guided tour of the Elgin Marbles by a very knowledgeable and engaging volunteer guide.  Her presentation added immeasurably to my enjoyment of the museum.  Look for one of these volunteer-led tours.Admittance is free, so you can spent a few hours in the morning going through the Egypt exhibits, including viewing the famous Rosetta Stone, leave the museum to return to the modern world to see some of London’s other sights, then come back later in the day to view other exhibits, especially  on Thursdays and Fridays when the museum is open later.See the Elgin Marbles soon, as the Greek people are seeking to have them returned when renovations of the Parthenon are completed.The museum has a cafeteria in the Great Court, but the lines are usually long, and the seating scarce.  Much better for a quick snack is the coffee shop, near the Greece wing, west of the main entrance.Don’t miss this museum!",A Magical Place For My Son and Me
"March 15, 2008",My son and I both love Egyptian things and this is the best place to see because they have the largest collection of Egyptian artifacts outside of Cairo.  It was very overwhelming for me to see all of these wonderful things.  Some of the artifacts are huge and you can actually touch many of them.  I couldn't believe I was actually looking at the Rosetta Stone.  There are entire halls lined with carvings from Iraq which tell tales of great battles.  This is a great way to see artifacts from countries which are dangerous for westerners to visit.  If this museum didn't exist we might never have gotten to see these beautiful things.,Egyptian artifacts
"January 10, 2007","The British Museum is an extraordinary walk through the past. The Egyptian artifacts (mummies, drawings, urns, et al) are magnificent. It does seem to be rather an unorganized presentation, but I loved it all because we were fortunate enough to have a guide who was an archeologist. She was thorough and delightful. We were mesmerized by her every word.",I would highly recommend.
"September 27, 2003","We truly enjoyed our visit to the Museum. London is a very expensive place as we all know, and to find some thing as fabulous as this that was free that the icing on the cake",The Most Amazing Thing About The British Museum
"November 3, 2023","Nothing in it is British. Virtually every artefact was stolen at some point in history from another country somewhere around the globe. Egypt, Greece, China, Iran, Iraq, India, Japan, Malawi, Zambia. So to all those bigots and racists that say “we should send all the foreigners back”, maybe we should send all their stuff with them, eh?",Not British....
"May 16, 2020",Excellent museum......but there is nothing British about it.With Brexit time to Greek marbles to... exit.Acropolis museum is much better and more appropriate for the conversation on the Greek Parthenon marbles.,Plan to spend hours here!
"August 22, 2019","The British Museum has such a variety of artifacts that it is hard to decide where to begin. I thought my favorites were the Greek artifacts until I saw the Egyptian artifacts and the cat mummies. But then again the Roman jewelry and the watch/clock exhibits are so cool. Wait! The dinosaurs! You have to see the dinosaurs! Plan to spend the day here and when you need a respite, there is a cafe for refreshments. ",Crowded. 
"July 24, 2019","Great museum, quite a large collection of well-known pieces, however - very crowded, which is understandable - the place has lots of stuff to see and no entry fees. Instead of begging for donations it'd be much better off having a day or two when there are entry fees. I'd much rather pay and have fewer people that just came by because it's free. Other than that - all good. ",Parthenon Marbles

"March 21, 2019","The hole museum was filled with exhibits for other cultures that has been removed for their origin countries. Seeing those exhibits remote from their home countries was very miserable and the guests receives a feeling of nervousness. Additionally, when we try to enter the part of the museum that the stolen Cariatid from Athens was placed, it was close to the public as the security guard should be there at 3:00 but he arrive after 3:15. It was the most disappointing museum that I have never visit.",Go EARLY and PLAN AHEAD to skip the insane queues!!!
"January 29, 2019","If you haven’t been to London since Instagram took over the travel industry, you need to know that London tourism has become INSANE in recent years, with Disney-level hours-long “queues” at every tourist destination. If you are coming during any sort of holiday period (we were here between Christmas and New Years, but apparently this is also true for... pretty much the entire spring, summer and fall!), you MUST PLAN very carefully to avoid spending your vacation waiting on line. We did this and we felt like we had the “Disney Fast Pass” to London! The British Museum is a great example. It’s free, so you’d think there’d be no ticket line. In the past, you could just “pop in and have a look” as the British say. Ah, but you forgot about security checks and crowd control. Today the queue, after forming accordion-style within the gates, continues in concentric circles around the block. I knew about this in advance and therefore was able to avoid it. How? Well, our only chance to see the museum was on the Sunday between Christmas and New Years—pretty much the worst possible time for crowds. So I planned. First, I downloaded all the maps and children’s activity trails (we have four kids ages 6-13) and printed them at home. (The things marked as the museum’s “highlights” form their own lines inside, so you have to plan ahead to avoid those too. Plus, there are even more lines to buy the maps and activity trails that are free online.) I also knew the museum opened at 10am, but I figured the queue might form earlier, so we got there bonkers-early—at 9:15am. At 9:15am on this busiest day of the year, not many people were there yet and there was no queue at all. We walked in, and of course the main galleries were not open yet. However, the gift shop and café in the Great Court were open, as were the already-forming queues for audioguides. So we took care of those things first, and by 9:40 I parked myself by the door that leads to the Rosetta Stone (something you can forget about seeing if you don't get there at that hour... and which is a must-see for historic reasons, but which isn't big or beautiful enough on its own to merit any kind of wait), and summoned the rest of the family to join me some ten minutes later. By the time they opened that door at exactly 10am, an IMMENSE queue had formed behind us. They opened the door and this mass of people surged toward the Rosetta Stone like it was the last flight out of Saigon in 1973. We checked out the stone (and then had trouble squeezing away from it with all the people pushing behind us!) and moved on to the Elgin Marbles (which are about two rooms in, and another thing that generates massive lines), which were totally deserted at that hour. We enjoyed those and then went up to the Egyptian galleries (another major highlight), which were also still pretty empty. By the time the mixed multitude reached Egypt within the next hour or so, we had already completed our exodus from Egypt and had moved on to various promised lands which other visitors hadn’t discovered yet. In this way we continuously beat the legendary crowds. By the time we left the museum around 1pm (yes you need that much time inside!) the queue to get into the building was well around the block. If you come to London during a busy time, do not even consider coming to this museum at any time other than 9:15am. The other tourist places that require first-thing-in-the-morning priority are Tower of London (buy tickets in advance and print at home, get there at least a half hour before opening, and go DIRECTLY to the Crown Jewels... otherwise, that Crown Jewels queue is something for the ages) and Windsor Castle (for this one you MUST get advance print-at-home tickets.... and then tell the security guards that you have them and you may be able to jump to the front of the queue, which without exaggeration is a full mile long around the outside of the castle). You also need advance print-at-home tickets for Westminster Abbey (but those, thankfully, are timed entry, so save your early-morning visits for stuff that doesn’t have that advantage). And of course Harry Potter Studio tickets must be bought months in advance. (Hot tip: I missed my chance to buy those tickets and was still able to get them from something called Golden Tours. A rip-off, but it got the job done and it at least included a bus so we didn’t need a car.) You will have a marvelous time in London, but unlike in years past, you won’t have a marvelous time if you don’t plan ahead. Plan ahead and have a great time!",British museum with non british artifacts
"September 17, 2018","We visited with my girlfriend on a hot August day.No aircon throughout the building, poor staffing and management. Cant imagine what the effect of the heat could be on the artifacts.We primarily visited the museum, to access the Greek Parthenon marbles that were transferred to the UK by Elgin. Let me remind all readers of this review that the marbles were not given back to where the belong with the excuse that the Greeks would not take proper care of them...The acropolis museum though is top 5 in the world compared to British museum which falls short.Otherwise, great collection of artifacts from all over the world, extensive collection, great description and amazing atrium.British museum with limited collection of British artifacts....",Impossible

Pros: free, awesome, loads to see and interact with, perfect for all agesCons: cafe is busy and expensive",Viking Exhibition - don't bother
"April 7, 2014","Today we visited the British Museum to see the Viking exhibition. Despite the timed tickets and the rigorous enforcement of the timings, with a double check before entry into the exhibition itself, it was almost impossible to see many of the artefacts due to the amount of visitors. Small children were being pushed aside so that the older visitors could see the exhibits whilst listening to their audio guides. There is much to be praised about the moving walkway at the Crown Jewels exhibition in the Tower of London, at least this gives every visitor (old and young, tall and small) the opportunity to view the exhibits.We left the exhibition disillusioned and disappointed. The young people in our party felt that they were not welcome and have indicated that they would rather not visit the BM again. By a stroke the BM have not only left me feeling cheated as the timed tickets cost each adult in our party £16.50 plus £1 booking fee - to have the opportunity to enter the exhibition, but not to be able to see the exhibits: they have also made 2 young people feel that they would never want to return to a BM exhibition again.The staff at the information desks were really helpful and enthusiastic with our young people, they went out of their way to give us the information to make our visit a success. The sheer volume of visitors in the Viking exhibition, sadly, made this exhibition a huge disappointment.If you would like your children to develop a fascination and curiosity in history - most definitely do not waste your money on this.",Very rude member of staff
"September 27, 2015","A female member of staff rudely told our tour guide to speak quietly even though no one else was in the gallery.  Then she threw away one of our teenagers lunches that was in a clear plastic bag claiming it could have been a bomb. Im not sure why she picked it up and threw it in the bin, instead of clearing the area and calling the police, if she truly believed it was a hazard. She then refused to give it back. We live in London so pay for this museum out of our taxes so we don't expect to be treated like this by the staff. ",Boring and old fashioned exhibition.
"April 7, 2014","Oh dear British Museum! The Vikings exhibition ...where do I start? We were so looking forward to this exhibition having visited Viking museums in Denmark, Sweden and Finland. We had heard so much about it. Obviously we knew it was going to be mobbed as all such exhibitions are now, but if this is the case and the museum wants to maximise the number of visitors it will also have to radically review its design and layouts for the exhibition, perhaps maximising digital technology more. Shuffling round cases with 100’s of other visitors is not pleasant or instructive; neither would I rush back for another exhibition like this. Many cases and labels could not be read due to the crush. People took long periods to read and study exhibits and this meant others could not do the same. There was no decent introduction to the exhibition. No drama, just fairly dull cases of exhibits and some, very brief footage. Given the subject matter “Vikings” surely there could have been some more drama and excitement injected into this exhibition? The Viking museum in Stockholm is a far more entertaining history of the Viking age. The queues subsided a little by the time we got to the boat and finally there was better use of visuals and film footage. But with all the technology available today surely an institution  like the British Museum could have created a far more exciting, interesting exhibition, which was much more accessible to the large numbers you wanted to go thorough it each hour. Museums have come a long way since the days of glass cabinets and signs. Come on British Museum as one of the pre-eminent museums of the world you need to be moving with the times. Some of our smaller museums in the UK have understood this and moved with the times. You need to do likewise.",Vikings
"March 24, 2014",I have enjoyed many special exhibitions at the BM - the Vikings is certainly not worth the entrance fee. As other reviewers have said it is ridiculously overcrowded and it took 20 minutes from the entrance to reach the first case. It was crowded the whole way through and about halfway around I just gave up as I was thoroughly frustrated. Poor labelling meant I came away with no further knowledge of the Vikings. It's almost as if the exhibition had been put together by amateurs. This has made me seriously consider whether I go to any future exhibitions. Very very disappointing.,"Viking Exhibition - overcrowded, overpriced and underwhelming"
"March 22, 2014","The British Museum’s Viking exhibition is a disgraceful shambles.    It must be the most crowded exhibition ever experienced.  We were very disappointed to find the queues unacceptably long.   Immediately on beginning the queue we were advised by the BM staff to move to another part of the exhibition.   We decided to queue for a while but after waiting 15 minutes and not even reaching the 1st display case, we decided to move on.   However, the remainder of the exhibition was also completely packed, full to bursting.  At each and every exhibition case the customers were 4 or more deep and no-one was moving.  As for the centrepiece of the exhibition:    Where was the impressive boat prow?   All that was exhibited were a few pieces of wood lying at the base of the 21st century steel structure.   A vivid imagination is required.  It was definitely unimpressive.We made the difficult decision to abandon the exhibition.   But actually it was with relief that we left after spending a frustrating 45 minutes in the exhibition without actually seeing anything of note because of the mass of people.The BM appear to be more interested in making money than in providing an enjoyable  and enlightening experience.We’ll be avoiding any future exhibitions at the BM unless we are assured they have made significant improvements.  Perhaps, the organisers should take a little trip to the V & A or British Library to see how it’s done.",a complete waste of money. Vikings.
"March 17, 2014","What is the point of having timed entry if there is no control of the numbers of people inside the exhibition. The British Museum have completely overestimated the numbers of people this exhibition wold comfortably absorb, at least on a Sunday afternoon. I should have feared the worst when the attendant at the entrance said 'you might want to skip the first room, and rejoin the start of the exhibition later!'....... how about, ""Tell you what the British museum have just fleeced you of £49.50 for 3 tickets, the whole exhibition is very overcrowded, but we have got a shop at the end fully of tacky presents for you to buy to go home with. Have a nice day."" What the British Museum should adopt is attendants at staggered/ strategic stages of the exhibition making sure there is a good flow of people, as ably demonstrated by Durham and the Lindisfarne Gospels exhibition. And BM - don't going telling me that the numbers for that exhibition were smaller and far more manageable.   I would be saying don't go to the Vikings at a weekend.

After being denied admission to the exhibition, we moved to a space that would allow other visitors to pass us, which this staff member took exception to and called security.

"December 19, 2006","I've been to the British Museum a couple of times on various trips to England.  I recommend taking the extra time to plan your trip ahead by reading the museum's website.  Some galleries do close early even on the late open nights, so if there's something you must see, plan accordingly.    A previous visitor stated that he went by the times on the website and was led astray, but he simply didn't read carefully enough.  I've coordinated multiple trips to the British Museum, and know that the website clearly lists every gallery that is open/closed on the late entry nights (See http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/visit/lateopening.html).  Gallery closing information is also found on the printed visitor brochures from the British Museum.I've been on both the free EyeOpeners tours, and the paid Highlights tour.  While the EyeOpeners tours are hit or miss (I blame the volunteer guides), the Highlights tours are exceptional.  You'll find each Highlights tour is slightly different as per the interests of the guide you get, but even when the subject matter isn't something I'm particularly interested in, the guides are always exceptional.   The Highlights pace is slow enough to accommodate guests with disabilities.  The size of the tours are limited, so if you are planning your itinerary down to the last detail from abroad, definitely book your tour ahead of time.  You can book these online at the museum's website.I've also been on a private guided tour of the museum by a local historian, which was also excellent.   Our guide  took the time to find out what we were interested in and led us to some of the less-visited gems of the Museum.  Be prepared to hike on  this type of tour as it might take some long walks and hiking up and down stairs to get to the galleries. Of the tour options, the audio tours are my least favorite, mainly because you can't ask questions, and the audio tours make it nearly impossible to converse with your traveling companions.  I wouldn't personally ever use  the audio tours unless you are visiting the museum alone or are a non-English speaker.",Saddening...

"March 17, 2014","Went on Saturday 15 March through a timed ticket allowing entry at 11.20.Hugely dissappointed! There was little in the way of queue management from the staff other than suggesting that we go to a different part of the exhibition then returning later for the exhibits. This showed a complete misunderstanding of the problem because when we tried to get back to the start we were confronted by other visitors and it was like walking against a river current. In general all exhibits were poorly displayed with NO identification (simple numbers would have sufficed) in the text which was always poorly sited at the bottom on the exhibition cabinet. National Museum you should be acutely aware of the queuing problems we witnessed last Saturday as the exhibition has now been running for a few weeks and yet, so far as I could tell are doing nothing about it. The place was so crowded that we left after just 30 minutes to take in the rest of the museum which was as a museum should be tranquil, uncluttered and informative.

"August 4, 2013",I may be a liitle confused but I went into the British museum really expecting to see British history and items from the past.  What I saw was Egyption history and Indian OK maybe the latter was part of the empire but so was Britain so why such limited information about our history.,Life and death in Pompeii and Herculaneum - exhibition only
"May 4, 2013","I was quite excited at getting the opportunity to view this exhibition having visited Pompeii and Herculaneum several years ago and hot having had chance to get to the museums there to see the artefacts.Purchased ticket online, you don’t need to queue at the ticket office, just head for the Herculaneum queue with the print out.  They will ask for your surname (not the credit card you paid with) and with a surly attitude they will say you are 10 minutes early and you have to go back at the end of the queue.So the slots for groups are every 10 minutes which ensures a constant thick flow of people which explains the huge bottleneck on entrance which continues throughout the event.  Initially you crowd around a poor dog which has been eternally captured twisted in agony but don’t expect the rest of the exhibition to follow in this vein.   You shuffle around for the next hour bumping shoulders and on tiptoes to try and look at the usual jewels, crockery, hairpins and oil lights and the struggle to read descriptions before the next person treads on your toe or tuts in your ear.The one exceptional piece, not for the feint-hearted, is a statue of Pan fornicating with a goat, it is in pristine condition and gives you a sense of the humour, craftsmanship and beliefs of the Romans, and this is echoed in the murals, inscriptions and friezes giving you an interesting look into Roman life at the time.You finish off with another moving piece, the display of people in the throes of death, holding their nose and in the boxing position as their terrifying death is captured forever which makes you imagine their death and marvel at the actual size of the person.I left this exhibition a bit deflated.  It wasn’t the lack of value for money £16 I’d spent and not having even a piece of paper to explain in depth what I was seeing and indeed seeing things of which better examples are displayed even within the museum itself; or the fact I had been the sheep in a flock which had squeezed around some silly dead-ended layouts which couldn’t accommodate the swarms.  I think it was the fact that I had pushed, shoved and fought to see some poor soul and their loved ones scalded and burned to death that left me a bit deflated and voyeuristic but then again that’s what I paid for.Please note this review is for the exhibition only and does not reflect on the excellence of the rest of the museum.I am de-selecting wheelchair and buggy access, because of the amount of bodies, lack of space, the narrow lanes to some exhibitions without turning space and taking into account that most displays are above 4'.",Unbeliveable museum

The Elgin Marbles and the Egyptian Artifacts are highlights, there were many other recognizable exhibit (like the statue from Easter Island). Also be sure to stop by the reading room in the very center of the museum The museum was busy but not overly crowded. You can cover the highlights in an hour or two, but it would easily be possible to spend much longer here. I noticed that other reviewers mentioned the layout of the museum.

"July 23, 2018","Being a fan of museums and having been to over 100 countries, This was my second visit to the British Museum, and I’ll likely return on another London visit. I’ve visited many museums. Certainly, this is one of the ten best museums in the world. It is dedicated to archaeology and ethnography. There are 94 galleries, all with excellent exhibits, spread over 807,000 square feet of museum space. The total collection is comprised of over 8,000,000 works of art, prehistoric bones, Egyptian mummies, the Rosetta Stone, and other pieces of our world’s history and people. The largest collections are those dedicated to ancient Egypt, ancient Greece and Rome, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. This is an easy place to spend an enjoyable half or full day, after which at best, you’ll only have seen 20% to 40% of the exhibits. Admission to the Museum is free (donations accepted), but occasionally they charge for entry to some temporary exhibitions and events. Before or after entering, look at the free map of the layout, and plan your tour. Also, I recommend getting the audio guide, to get a better understanding of the things you are viewing and their significance.

Egyptian mummies, Roman treasures, Saxon finds, Chinese curiosities and the unforgettable Parthenon marbles are all on display. I would suggest you try to plan your visit ahead of time using the museum's website if you can, or buy or download one of the highlights booklets so you're not wandering aimlessly. There is a LOT to see inside and you can't see everything if you are short on time, so pick a few essential things that are your 'must-sees' and then enjoy the rest of your time exploring the rest of the rooms.",Horrificly disappointing disabled access!
"August 13, 2015","I would have loved the exhibits if I could see them!  In the ENTIRE Museum there are only 3 small lifts (elevators) and they are clogged with primarily Asian and middle eastern tourists who could walk fine and are just lazy; forcing the disabled to wait and wait through numerous trips because there were already full when reaching my level.  I never saw one person other than me in a the elevator with a wheelchair, walker or even using a cane.  They have no qualms about it either and I finally told some of them off for what I thought about it.It took 30 minutes on average (once 45 minutes) to get an elevator to move even a half floor down because of stairs!  1 lift (yes 1 lift not a bank of lifts) is in the back half and 2 are near the front entrance and that is it for a 7 level massive museum.Further all of the lifts required me to get out of my wheelchair to go through the entry.  There are also numerous changes in level that require a lot of navigation to find a way there where there are no stairs.Also all the print for all the objects is tiny that even with 20/20 vision you can't read it.They were all out of maps for sale and the signage is poor.Also many isles are too narrow, even in the rotunda area they built in 2000 where they could have put a huge bank of elevators they only put 1 more tiny lift.Sadly this was to be the high point of my trip to London, now I am so upset at trying to get around I may not go back for the 2nd day I planned there.This was a Friday early afternoon but not too busy in general, I can't imagine what it would be like if it were any busier I couldn't even get through a hallway.  Sadly the exhibits look awesome but I guess I won't get to enjoy them like I was hoping.As a Lodnon landmark it is a testament to the superiority of the Americans with Disabilities act of the United States.",Viking exhibition - a lot of fuss about nothing spectacular
"April 9, 2014","From the moment the pedantic member of staff turned us away from the queue for being a minute early, to the throngs of folk peering at the unremarkable objects in poorly set out displays this was a real let down. Save your money and look around the other far more noteworthy exhibitions in this fantastic museum.",Viking Exhibit is a waste of time and money
"March 18, 2014","I think the British Museum in its entirety is a wonderful experience, and highly recommend it. HOWEVER, the current Viking Exhibition is a fiasco.It's poorly designed and poorly regulated; the timed tickets appear to do nothing as the front rooms of the exhibit were packed. We had to skip the first section because we didn't want to queue for an hour to read a few captions. The exhibit could have been spread out a little more, and the number of people in it should be better regulated. Very surprised by how bad this exhibit was because the Pompeii exhibit was excellent. But definitely give the Viking Exhibit a miss; it's not worth the time or money.",Viking Exhibition sunk by overcrowding
"March 14, 2014","I visited the Viking exhibition at 1pm today Friday,14th March, 2014.  I went first to the museum's central ticket booth at 12.10pm and was advised that I would not be able to enter this exhibition until 1pm earliest.This delay was easily managed because there are plenty of other things -wonderful and free - to see in the meantime.I paid £16.50 for a standard, adult entry ticket and was admitted punctually at 1pm. I was actually astonished to find that the outside entry queue continued within the exhibition, only now much worse; not moving; immediately restricting me in within a confined space, looping back on itself in order to view the first, early exhibits and stretching out of sight, around a further right hand  corner.At no point in the exhbition -which is a good size -did the crowding ease at all, except in the vicinity of the exit area.There were, of course, some great items and groupings of items in this exhibiton - but I noticed that two thirds of my focus was taken up negotiating the crowds; trying to see the exhibits; manoeuvring to try and get close enough to read the signage - often failing to do this - and, as is the custom, taking some care not to block everyone else's attempts to do the same thing.I may have this wrong, but I could find not find feedbacks forms or other outlet to let the museum know they had  a problem with this paying customer's experience of their service. I inclined to the intepretation - perhaps wrongly - the museum's management is just complacement about it's paying exhibitions - it's highly prestigious; full of happy and excited people (in the free areas) and very successful, so - why should they care?",Went  to see Vikings exhibition but didn't
"March 10, 2014",I had a booked timed entry to the Vikings. However when I got in it was so ludicrously crowded couldn't see a thing.I complained and got my money back but would not recommend anyone to go to this unless you receive assurances that there is better monitoring of crowds. I would have thought that the British Museum would be experienced in dealing with bookings as people pay a lot of money for  these special shows. Extremely disappointing.Also took a day off work to go to this.,Vikings: Life and Legend
"March 10, 2014","I booked a timed slot. Walked in and walked out. I asked for and received a refund. Exhibition is laid our so the viewers form a queue to look at each object. The queue resembles a winding snake. Could not view anything in comfort. Too crowded. Too claustrophobic. Too hot. If the British Museum is going to charge £17.50 (£1 booking fee online?) then it needs to provide an enjoyable experience. To me, they're more interested in making money than providing an enlightening experience. They've done the Vikings a disservice with this exhibition. I was so much looking forward to the visit and was extremely disappointed.","Overrated, and Immoral"
"December 20, 2011","I typed a review much like this a week ago, and it was removed. I don't appreciate the 1984 approach, as what follows is very much my experience, and I feel I should be able to voice it. I cannot be the only educated, and liberally minded, person who feels the same.* * *Norman Foster’s ceiling is much lauded, and it is very good at being sympathetic despite being hyper-modern. However, the museum displays depressingly little and seems to circulate their exhibits far too seldom. My favourite hall is the Sainsbury's African Hall, featuring an amazing sculpture of a tree made entirely out of used ammunition, guns etc (I believe the artists are Mozambican).It's appalling, however, how so many of the world's great treasures are kept in so uninspiring and boring a space - rather than in their places of origin. In the African exhibit there was a magnificent, ancient, Nigerian Mask. The thought that it is in a petrifying building in so lifeless a city depresses me greatly.   I realise it's a tricky debate, but I think the British should be absolutely ashamed that more has not been done to rectify their past atrocities around the world, and much of the museum acts as a document to their rape and pillage just because they happened to have might once upon a time. There is insufficient seating, and the museum is overcrowded. Often the information displays are positioned low, making it impractical to read them amidst the throngs of people.",Rosetta Stone Alone Made London Trip Worthwhile!
"November 21, 2008","About 15 years ago, I went on a tour of London that didn't include the British Museum so, having had a lifelong fascination with the Rosetta Stone and knowing it was there, I took a break from the organized tour and walked to the museum on my own.  I floated back on Cloud 9, however.The day I went, and I have no idea what day of the week that was or what time of day, the museum wasn't all that crowded and I easily found what I was looking for on a pedestal, ""guarded"" by a woman who sat nearby in a uniform, knitting.  The pedestal had a velvet rope thing around the area so you couldn't get closer than about three feet.While I stared at the artifact that made reading the hieroglyphics possible, thinking about Napoleon and everyone else involved, a little girl darted out of nowhere, ran under the rope, and set her fingertips on the granite slab.  Electricity shot through me.  It was as though I touched the cold granite myself.  I was so moved by the experience that I had to go hide in another aisle and wipe away the tears.If you love history, the British Museum is the place for you!",Selecting a cafe when visiting British Museum
"March 17, 2008","As a avid museum goer I would rate British Museum as big or huge (albeit with nice architecture)You can spend a lot of time at the BM and YOU will become hungry or pekish and you have many choices I will give you two tips for how you should spend your quids in that case.1) On the inside - The cafe/restaurant at the top floor of BM - go there for afternoon tea, order champagne and tea and just relax from the hustle and bustle of the museum.2) On the outside - The cameracafe on Museum street 44It is almost always empty its kinda quirky, cosy and with excellent choices and very personal service.You'll find their website at->  http://www.cameracafe.co.uk/and they do have wifi and where else do you get your camera questions answered while you order your latte? It's a unique place indeed!",The Greatest Museum in the World (that I have visited)
"October 13, 2007","The British Museum is the best museum I have ever visited, and makes a good case for the #1 London attraction.  The amount of artifacts is simply staggering, overwhelming for first-time visitors.  It can be hard to decide exactly where to start.  Admission to the galleries is free, but I took a 5-pound Highlights tour, which was a good way to see a lot of the famous pieces in a short time (90 minutes).  The information presented is top-notch and the tour covers several different areas of the museum, including some you probably won't find on your own.  It's not necessary to know a lot beforehand about art or history because the guides manage to cover a lot of ground.  The only complaint I had was that the tour guide was late in showing up and seemed distracted throughout the tour.  I do think it is necessary to either take a tour (human or audio) or buy a guide book, because otherwise you could get seriously lost and lose track of time.The content of the museum is what makes it one of the greatest in the world.  Where else can you see the Rosetta Stone, Parthenon marbles (which Greece wants back), Assyrian reliefs, and multitudes of artifacts from practically every area and culture of the world?  The fact that I have seen several pieces from the British Museum in my art history class just confirms how important it is.  And, the whole thing is free; it can't get better than this.The only drawbacks to the British Museum is that it is popular and large.  It was extremely crowded on the day I went (in July), so much so that it was hard to get a glimpse of the Rosetta Stone, much less take a picture.  The volume of pieces in the museum is impossible to cover in one visit.  For a first visit with limited time, I would suggest taking the Highlights tour and then going through the galleries on the first floor that have the most impressive and famous artifacts: Egyptian, Near East, and Greek.", The remarkable fusion of the British Museum's treasures with David's expertise.
"December 25, 2023",""" I highly recommend the 'David's Bible Journey' at the British Museum! During this experience, David vividly narrated Bible stories, spanning from the era of Abraham to Moses, and approximately a thousand years ago during King David's reign. He intricately blended archaeological findings and historical evidence, providing me with a fresh understanding of these narratives. His storytelling not only immersed me in history but also brought me closer to ancient cultures and the societal context of that time. The fusion of the British Museum's treasures with David's expertise created a mesmerizing experience. This journey deepened my appreciation for the connection between archaeology and history in an incredible way!""",Not Very British.
"October 18, 2023","Don't bother going here to learn anything about Britain and its history, There wasn't a single British thing on display. It's just a whole bunch of random stuff that was liberated from other countries and cultures. It only served to reinforce the view that being British is not something to proud of. The only thing British was the massive Queue to get in.",Amazing museum
"April 1, 2020","I mean it is just amazing as it is. The design, interior and the exhibition is amazing. If you are in London, visit it the day you come there! ",A must see

"September 4, 2019","Fun fact - if it's a rainy day in London, everyone goes to the museum, sooooo this means long lines!! With that being said, the museum is massive and would probably take a good 6 hours to explore. With my African studies background and previous visits to various African countries, I had an interest in visiting this section of the museum. It was on the smaller side, but I still thoroughly enjoyed looking through various artifacts (most from former colonized areas in West Africa). I found it fascinating to visually examine the items and read the historical accounts of each artifact. Loved it!",The most visited museum in London !!!
"September 3, 2019","If you’ve got a few hours to spare in central London. Then you must visit the British museum, it’s free entry & a great place to spend a few hours. The nearest tube station is Russel square, like I said not only is it free entry, it’s got some fascinating artefacts on display. It never fails to amaze me every time we visit.",Nice visit
"August 20, 2019","The British Museum was really nice, many different sculptures from different countries around the world. I loved it and it was very interesting. I surely recommend this place if you like art and if you have kids of age 8-15, even if you don’t like art you can still have fun there. But the only problem there is that they don’t have any air conditioning. But the building looks gorgeous !!!",A MUST. No similar museum I have ever been

"August 18, 2019",Spectacular museum which guard historical treasures from all over the world. The heritage of the great conquers of the massive British empire. Absolutely a must see in London that deserves several visits to truly explore it.,Fantastic experience 
"July 26, 2019","We arrived early in the morning. The lines were low. After getting through the doors, the learning began. We didn’t have time to explore all the rooms.

A full day will only barely get you through the Ancient Civilizations, Ancient Greece, and Rome. You will NOT be disappointed! Only complaint: the weather was perfect outside 70 degrees F, but the Museum ranged from warm to hot.",Something for Everyone
"July 23, 2019","First of all, the British Museum is free, so you already go in with a smile. Secondly, the lines are not very long (at least not when we went in). Having waited two hours in the rain to get into the L’Oeuvre, I appreciated the accessibility. The museum is large, and there is much to see, so it’s nice not to feel that you don’t have to get it all in during one visit. It’s so easy to get in, you can just come back. The art here is mostly 3-D, with an emphasis on classical antiquities. If it’s paintings you want, you’re in the wrong place. They did have an interesting collection of Rembrandt sketches (free) and a special exhibit of Edward Munch ($) but otherwise it’s all sculptures and artifacts. The map includes a “must see” list, which made it easier to navigate. The biggest treasure here would have to be the Rosetta Stone. Try to see it early in the day, because it does get busy. Some of the other recommendations were a bit disappointing, but we found other unexpected treasures along the way. I especially enjoyed the clock room, which had beautiful, intricately designed automatons. Having seen Hugo, I have developed a soft spot for these machines. There’s something about the marriage of art and science that seems so complete. If you have a day in London, I recommend you go to the British Museum. You’ll find some unexpected treasures in a relaxed atmosphere. ",Manga Mania
"July 22, 2019","Me and my two kids went to the manga exhibit and we saw the history of the manga from the 1800's to now! Great fun for all, and I recommend a visit!",You could spend hours to days here
"July 20, 2019","Really enjoyed the British Museum.   Great to see the Rosetta Stone.  Word of caution. The second floor restaurant is reservations only, but the Cafés on the main floor where you pick up your food then walk to a table served good sandwiches. Also back elevator to floors 3,4,5 had long lines. If you can do the stairs that’s the way to go. If you are in a wheelchair there is only this one elevator to those exhibits so be prepared to wait. ",At British Museum looking at the Rosetta Stone
"June 27, 2019",We were at the British Museum looking at the Rosetta Stone. People were calmly working their way up to the display taking turns and everyone was getting a chance to get their photos and view the artifact. Then a C Tour group rushed in and started shoving everyone and trying to push everyone out of the way. A man put his hands on me and tried to push me out of his way.  I am a foot taller than him so that did not work for him.  The museum needs guards to protect the other visitors..,Unfriendly and unhelpful staff
"June 5, 2019",We were looking for a quiet room and were given misinformation a number of times.  We were eventually advised to go downstairs where a very unfriendly staff member told us to move on. She then started to speak to someone on the phone clearly speaking about us. The whole episode left me upset and has put me off going to the British museum ever again.,A fascinating place and free entrance
"May 8, 2019","The place is neat and pleasant, there is plenty to see in the museum, antiquities from many countries and continents, mummies from Egypt, ancient Asia and more. You can take a map at the entrance where you can know where to go, there are workers everywhere that can help you in directions. A very good experience",Halloween 31.08.2018
"October 31, 2018","The Halloween evening event was rather disorganised from the beginning. All members had to queue outside for 30 minutes or more before being allowed to enter (when they could have used the time to hand out the programme for the evening which took time to understand - what was on, at what time and which room). We entered the building provided with a plastic chip (purpose unexplained) and not knowing where to go except guided either towards a bar or a ticket desk. We found out the chip was to be used for 1 drink at the bar. Then on to the ticket desk. The reason for the ticket desk was also unclear - not explained in the programme until you arrived at the queue itself. Standing in one of the two ticket queues we suddenly had to select 1 of the 3 tours on option (not knowing what the 3 options actually were(unclear from the programme) and explained to us very quickly in a hasty manner. The personnel also seemed somewhat stressed and appeared to not handle the crowd too well. By this time you walked around seeing more queues to activities that were not yet open and not knowing what to do except to head towards the car to eat something which of course took time and then finding out we only had about 2 hours to go around the activities with having attended 1 tour which lasted 40 minutes leaving little time for walking around to find a space to join in on activities. Due to this, we actually didn’t manage to join in on any activities just became a mere standby observer. For the money and the expectations we had of it being an event organised by the British Museum, I would have expected a better organised event. ",Stoolen tressures

"August 28, 2015","A wonderful museum, everyone is bound to find something to interest them in there! There's so much to look at, and the rooms are so vast that even if there are a lot of people, it will never feel crowded. You can take your time to see the exhibitions, take one of the guided tours (they have different lenghts depending how much time you have) or using the audio tours. They have one for kids as well!They have hands-on stations, with museum items you're allowed to touch. I got to touch a 350 000 year old hand axe, the mind boggles! There are many of these stations around, and a lot of interesting information to be had, for adults and kids alike. The museum is free to enter, and I heartily recommend giving The British Museum a visit, whether it is a rainy day or not. You will be awed by the beautiful collections and inspired for years to come! I have been there 3-4 times now, and I still haven't been able to see everything, there's so much to discover - and all for free!",Sunday Morning - Should have taken a walk in the Park
"December 20, 2014","Possibly the most disappointing visit to a Major Museum I have had...ever.Free entry does not offset the facts the Museum was difficult to navigate, the staff looked poorly motivated, I witnessed some being quite short tempered with the visitors (excited kids), some huddled around portable electric radiators, guess it's hard to be enthusiastic when you are cold. Some galleries were shut, many of the exhibits were missing from there places in the display cabinets, so much so that I thought the Viking and Sutton Hoo exhibit had been burglarised...This Museum needs to get back to what it used to do very well, educate and excite young minds, the administration appears to have lost its way.Also the Acropolis / Elgin Marbles exhibition is an EMBARRASSMENT, these should be returned to Greece and viewed in context at the new Acropolis Museum, which incidentally should any of the Museum Managers read this, is a modern museum which gets it.Visitors should take a minute to read the exhibition notes, I really have not read such politically incorrect and patronising drivel since the 1980's. What a disappointment, I really should have gone to the park.",We HAD a 15 item Plan !!
"September 10, 2014",We only had a small amount of time to visit this wonderful museum.  We had a map and were walking around finding the exhibits when we ran into one of the museum's administrators - and she was wonderful.  She asked to see our list and actually smiled about the items that we had chosen to see.  She was definitely helpful to us.  We came to see the Rosetta Stone and stayed for so much more.   Be sure to not miss this wonderful experience.  It is maintained in an excellent state.,"Key exhibitions are superb, rest less so"
"May 6, 2014","Wear comfortable shoes as this museum is vast.  It covers pretty much every civilisation since early man. Its breadth is in part its weakness as some of its exhibits are simply too small to do justice to every facet of human history and I felt there were a couple of surprising omissions from some of mankind's formulative centuries.  But its main exhibitions and those rooms for which it is justly famous are breath-taking.Must-sees are of course its Egypt and early civilsations (Greece, Rome) rooms but it also has some fascinating tangential exhibits such as its one on clock- and watch-making from the very earliest to the present day. Access for less mobile visitors is so-so.  There are elevators but spaced far apart but they've done what they can with what is an antique building in its own right.  Food - from Benugo - is good by museum standards, and seating in the main court area plentiful.  It's worth visiting just to see its 'floating' glass roof but don't rush your visit or you'll leave feeling like you missed something - which you probably will have done!","too many crowds, couldn't see the exhibits!"
"March 22, 2014","Oh dear!  Most of us had travelled a long way and spent our money on trains and petrol to get there:  only to be confronted by hordes - and not Viking ones, but hot and discontented visitors - attempting to get close enough to the glass cases to see their contents!British Museum, you should be ashamed of yourself.  You have sold far too many tickets for each slot.  The overall atmosphere, rather than being a pleasure for your visitors who have all paid an entry fee, was one of annoyance and phrases such as, ""This is not good enough"", ""Well really, who do they think we are?  I feel like part of a herd of cattle"" were echoing through the halls.   Not an encouraging indicator of a good day out!So, I am afraid, along with many others, I shall never know what was in those first cases.  Get to the boat after struggling through the crowds and missing a lot of exhibits and things fan out so that you can breathe at least.   But then you begin to realise that the contents of the cases are not fully covered by the captions next to them.  Questions such as, ""Well, what is that thing on the right then?"" were also heard.   And the whole exhibition lacked any atmosphere or any excitement over who the Vikings were.  One thing I did love was the Norse audiotrack ricocheting over the whole exhibition. Even that perhaps could have had translations interspersed to give the excitement of the content being read.So folks, if you are going, be prepared to fight your way through heaps of bodies to get to the cases and don't expect a seat to collapse on until you are three quarters of the way through the exhibition.  This is not for the faint hearted, but then the Vikings never gave us Brits an easy time!  Perhaps the British Museum thought they would recreate that for us - and have certainly succeeded!",British Museum- viking exhibition
"March 21, 2014","I love the British Museum and consider it to be one of the best, if not the best, in the world.BUT the Viking was a disaster and a complete waste of money.

The collection seems to be so extensive that I think maybe visiting it one full day would be preferable, if not two days.

"July 28, 2018","My wife and I are avidly interested in ancient history and antiquities. We had heard about the marvelous exhibits in the British Museum. The visit to this institution was to be the highlight to our trip to Brittan, Indeed, it was the primary motivation for our trip. However, our visit to your institution was a great disappointment. We arrived at 10:30 one weekday morning last April (2018) and waited in the rain for 45 minutes in a queue that went around the northeast side of the building. When arriving at the gate, we discovered there was another queue going around the southwest side of the building. There were some brief arguments at the gate as individuals in each queue claimed that theirs was the “proper” queue. Each wanted the others to go to end of their queue. Upon entering the building, we followed the signage to the restroom on the southwest side of the building only to discover it was inexplicably closed. The restrooms on either side of the Great Court had forty or more women and children waiting in queue going down each staircase—a disgrace. In one of the men’s restrooms, three of the six stalls were out of order, in another, two were not functional.My wife waited in queue for quite some time to obtain audio guides, only to be told, as she neared the desk, that they were all out and none would be available until the afternoon.The overcrowding and jostling by other visitors was prohibitive; we were not able to get even close to many of the principal exhibits. For example, we were only able to see the top few inches of the Rosetta Stone over the heads of the other visitors. In addition, the overcrowding that I observed raises safety concerns. In the event of an emergency, I seriously doubt that the building could be evacuated in a safe and timely manner.I have generally been very impressed by the museums in Brittan and Ireland: the National Gallery, the Roman Baths, the Petrie Museum at UCL, the Roman Army Museum and Vindolanda in the north, as well as the National Museum of Ireland, the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, etc. Typically, when my wife and I visit a major museum, we arrive at opening and stay until closing. Indeed, we had planned to spend several days at this institution. After an hour-and-a-half of this frustration, we left the British Museum, not to return. This museum is characterized by poor traffic management, inadequate facilities and equipment, and overcrowding. As these largely prohibit viewing the antiquities, we really don’t see the point behind opening this museum given these circumstances.",Does anybody even work here?
"July 27, 2018","We decided to spend the day wandering around the British Museum on our last day in London. Unfortunately, both the lack of staff members around the museum, as well as their sheer ignorance (i.e. standing around talking to each other about the weather) meant that several tourists we saw were either touching the artefacts or just plain leaning/sitting on them. At one point, I was so sick of seeing this (and with staff members turning a blind eye) that I took matters into my own hands and told a couple who were posing on a 3000 year old stela to stop touching it. To which I was told “Oh I just touch a little, you have problem with that?”Yeah I have a big problem with that. To the British Museum management - either put all of your priceless artefacts behind ropes/glass or employ more people who actually care about what they’re supposed to be guarding.To my fellow tourists - if you’re going to disrespect priceless historical artefacts, just don’t come here. You clearly have no appreciation for what a museum is.",First person to see the Rosetta Stone

There are many: audio guides from online sources; the ""top 10"" booklet from the museum; or the ""a short history in 100 objects"" podcast/book by the museum.We tried an app that closely matched the 100 objects that had 125 items. My daughter, 20-ish, and I gave it a decent shot, but in the end had to admit that 10:30 to 5:30 just wasn't enough time even though ~20 of our items were in closed halls.So, make a plan. 100 items is probably too many unless you know ~exactly~ where they are.A couple of notes:~ the Egyptian halls are tremendously busy…all.the.time.~ there's a replica Rosetta stone in hall #1 that you can touch and has no crowd~ there is a restriction on the maximum sized bag you can take into the museum~ the did at the cafés is surprisingly good~ they start closing halls well before the actual closing time. So if you're interested in Japan, don't leave the halls on the 5th floor until the end~ read a history in 100 objects beforehand, I wish I had, but only had Tim for ~1/3~ allow all day, but children, even 20-ish children get tired…50-ish feet get tired too :-)~ there's a great Turkish restaurant 250m towards the tube station which is quiet to allow reflection on what you've seen over a glass of wine.",Ten Stars!!! But Sadly only One
"March 31, 2017","Yes the British Museum should receive Ten Stars but perhaps some one will read this and agree it needs desperately to be cleaned and cleaned and cleaned and maybe brought up to date...when was the last time the walls were painted, the floors really cleaned, the lighting on the exhibits brought up to date, the bathrooms ..ugh!! ..it appeared more effort has been devoted and more precious space to the selling of trinkets...I know its""free"" but maybe, just maybe you need to charge £5 ..or more...its worth £20 .Perhaps get the attention of a guy like Bill Gates to buy some paint and cleaning tools. Such beautiful awe inspiring historical artifacts...what wonderful learning ..im still at loss on how to describe all that the museum has to offer but it was so depressing to see the sorry shape of the buildng itself. Recently we had the opportunity to visit the Metropolitan Museum in NYC....someone please from the British Museum visit there, each exhibit thoughtfully thought out in placement and lighting, every room and hall and yes the bathrooms too, clean, dusted and painted. The eating areas say, ""welcome, sit and relax and enjoy a drink, snack or food"",as you walk around there is always a place to sit and look at the exhibits...yes one can buy trinkets but the Museum store does not operate in a prime location. The British Museum can and should be the most beautiful museum in London....every piece of history that this Museum has deserves no less...the British People deserve a beautiful awe inspiring museum.",One Day Wasn't Enough!
"March 20, 2017","Wow.  Wow wow wow.I could not get enough of this museum.  We arrived when it opened thinking we would stay just a couple of hours.  We closed the place down - they had to force us out.  Honestly I could have spent my entire ten day trip here.  If you are a museum fan, you will love it here.  There are so many wonderful exhibits and amazing pieces.  The museum stores are fantastic and plentiful - everything from little souvenirs to an amazing bookshop to more luxurious items.  I highly recommend the tour which gives you highlights of some of the museum's most famous pieces.  This is a great option if you don't have a ton of time to spend - but buy tickets early - they sell out.  The cafe was also wonderful and super reasonable.  This is one of my favorite experiences from our trip.",Parthenon Gallery
"January 1, 2017","For all the claims that the Parthenon Marbles can best be shown and understood, in relation to other human achievements, if left in the British Museum and not returned to Greece, the state of this gallery belies it all. Having visited twice in the space of 12 months and also visited the Parthenon and the Acropolis Museum I would make several points about the British Museum display:Having appreciate the strength and intensity of the Attican light bathing the Parthenon, the dinginess of the Parthenon Gallery is upsetting.The skylight is filthy and had not been cleaned between the two visits as it had the same marks on it.Climatic controls in the gallery are inadequate and on a hot summer's day a side door must be opened to cool things down. Labelling is inadequateThe elements of the Parthenon are in an incorrect alignment relative to their original geographic arrangementThe elements cannot be understood in dynamic relation to the building they were cut from.Although the gallery has free admission, any in depth information about the exhibit  must be purchased.This is a shoddy relic of an exhibition, little more informative than butterflies in a glass case.  Certainly the beauty is obvious but it's been rendered passive, the active religious, aesthetic, architectural and contextual meanings of the marbles tripped away rendering them into artefacts. This museum is a sad hangover from the imperial era attempting to rebadge itself as a place of relevance in the world, it's not. Time for the Board of Trustees to move into the 21st century and start shifting things around.  For starters, return the Parthenon Marbles",Viking Exhibition
"March 18, 2014","What should have been a fascinating exhibition was spoiled by the large numbers of people being allowed in at once. Surely the point of having timed entry is to prevent this? Wouldn't it be possible to display the exhibit captions above the cabinets in some way? The great crush of people, particularly in the first room, completely blocked the captions (which, being grey on grey were difficult to read in any case) so I didn't know what I was trying to see. In other exhibitons I've visited, magnifiers have been provided to see the intricate detail of pieces of jewellery, but not here. The entire exhibition was laid out to be enjoyed by a small number of people: how many people get the opportunity of a private viewing?",Vikings - beware!
"March 18, 2014","I would advise anyone planning a visit to this exhibition to buy the catalogue instead and avoid the frustration of possibly the worst visitor experience I've ever had at any exhibition. I had a timed ticket for 12.30 on Monday 17 March, and expected that visitor numbers entering the exhibition would be regulated. Instead, I was met with crowds of people, three or four deep, some attempting to look at the exhibit, some bending to read the low level labels but most looking at, and fumbling with their audio guides. It was impossible to see anything in the first room and I moved on, only to discover that this was the pattern throughout this extremely poorly designed exhibition. As a result, I missed many of the exhibits entirely. When I was able to focus on something which caught my interest, it was almost impossible to work out what the exhibit was since this was unclear and too often the ill-matching ""description"" simply referred to which museum had loaned the artefact. The museum authorities should take steps to immediately reduce numbers entering the exhibition, remove audio guides which add considerably to congestion, replace the signage and perhaps employ a more competent exhibition designer in future.",Poorly organised viking exhibition
"March 17, 2014","When we saw that this exhibition would be coming we immediately booked our trip to London from the Netherlands. We were really looking forward to it, and the disappointment  was therefore enormous when we were let in just to enter the back of a non-moving queue. After about 10 minutes we decided to give up the wait (we had not yet reached the first display), and walked on to try to get a peek here and there. Which was not very successful either. My personal opinion is that for special exhibitions like this no audio tour should be offered. People tend to stand still and listen until the soundtrack for that particular object is finished, they then move on to repeat the process. This means that they are hardly moving, leading to insane queues.So if you are going to London and consider visiting this exhibition - don't!",Atrocious overcrowding
"March 12, 2014","In the main rooms there were crowds 2 to 3 people deep around every display.  With no formal queuing system inside the exhibition and the amount of people it meant one would have to spend a great deal of time waiting and jostling to get near any item rather than simply enjoying the visit.  We tried skipping a number of cases, thinking to see a display that was less busy and then return once the other display had become freer - however it was so busy around every item this strategy would not help. The only conclusion is that too many people have been allowed in..  After a few minutes in the exhibition we gave up and left.Either the museum has made a huge mistake and/or they have decided to pursue revenue at the expense of the visitor experience.  Very disappointing.",Viking Exhibition
"March 10, 2014",Interesting viking stuff.  But much of it is impossible to see. It's a slow over-crowded shuffle through dimly lit rooms past poorly displayed artefacts.  Explanations and presentations are minimal. The big viking ship is impressive at first glance - then you discover almost all of it is a steel reconstruction.  I left early and disappointed at having been able see little and learn less.,Viking exhibition
"March 10, 2014","We visited this exhibition yesterday, the British Museum have missed a wonderful opportunity. Like everyone else we would agree that the amount of people spoilt many things. The exhibits need a second information label higher up so that people not listening to the audio can read them easily, sometimes you can see some of the cases but not read the information as it is too small and too low.The first exhibit is a big let down, so small after queuing for some time, it needs something startling to make you want to go on! Models of viking life, home, clothes and games would have been great and more interesting for the children. It needs to be much more exciting. Simple museums in Norway and Denmark are much more enlightening, informative and atmospheric. This exhibition was very sterile.The toilets were a disgrace and we had to complain, obviously no one had been to check them for hours, I can't imagine what visitors to Britain think.What a shame. The British Museum should be able to do much better!","Poor Customer Service, but do they care?"
"April 6, 2013","Went there today to see the Pompeii exhibition. Had the London 2 for 1 voucher printed off and 2 adult National Rail travelcards. The girl at the ticket desk was rather surly and said that the offer was not valid at weekends. I pointed to her the terms and conditions that I had printed from the website showing nothing which stated that this was a weekday-only offer. She took a leaflet out and showed me it was a weekday offer. Fine. My sister who I was there with showed her Eurostar pass and knew from colleagues that this had been accepted for the 2 for 1 for staff members. The girl refused this too as she was adamant that we would pay full price.Unfortunately, it is very much a case of luck with who you end up being served by, as I'm certain that a customer-focused employee would have been friendlier and flexible.As far as the exhibition went, it was good, but not worth £15. It took me an hour to see from beginning to end.The organisation of the entrance to the exhibition left a lot to be desired. The screen outside shows the ticket time, but when you queue up you are told to wait (or even worse instructed to go to the back of the queue!) as there are others in the queue with earlier ticket times. Very crowded and messy way of getting people in.Apart from that, the food and gifts in the museum are vastly overpriced, however, this didn't seem to deter tourists from emptying their pockets.",we called it the 'british loot museum'.......
"January 3, 2013","..............as almost everything in it seemed to us to  be something precious stolen from somewhere else. On the up side it is a superb building with a massive range of artifacts. It is free admission which is to  be complimented in  this day and age.  They provide helpful maps and we did the 10 item 1 hour tour and in so doing you get to see a lot more than the 10 items set out in brochure. My favourite were the reall mummies ancluding mummified pets which weren't listed in the 10 at all. On downside it was raining day we went and was very very busy. crowds were almost intimidating and on basement floors th heat was uncomfortable. Still, a worthwhile visit even if we do think they should be giving a lot of the stuff back to it's original owners",Excellent free attraction - too much for one visit
"February 5, 2012","I only visited the free parts of the museum (the majority of it to be fair) and still I felt a two and a half hour visit hadn't done it anywhere near true justice, with still loads to explore and exhibits to look at. The place is absolutely huge and split up into various sections broadly based around different regions of the world. I particularly enjoyed the Egypt sections. There are lots of guided tours, I caught a bit of the Japan one and it was quite informative, didn't have time to see it all. I personally felt the paid for sections were a bit steep, but if I lived in London I'd probably purchase a membership, which is relatively cheap for the under 26s. Didn't try any food, it was pretty expensive, the toilets were clean. I'd happily visit again to see some of the other areas.",Good museum
"February 27, 2009","If you only have a few days in London, I wouldn't recommend that you spend all day here: just hit the big exhibits, and by big exhibits I mean Egypt, Assyria, and Greece. Very impressive collection of Egyptian mummies, Assyrian reliefs (including the epic winged lions at the entrance to the exhibit), and Greek sculptures from the Parthenon. And of course, don't miss the Rosetta Stone. It's the big black rock that everyone's crowding around in the entrance to the Egyptian exhibit.Three exhibits took about 2-3 hours to see. To avoid crowds, don't go in the weekend afternoons like I did!",so much to see

"December 29, 2019","The British Museum—dedicated to worldwide culture, art, and history—is overflowing with unique exhibits and some 8 million objects; enough to keep one busy for several days. Open since the late 18th century, the museum owes much of its collection to the days of the British Empire and so there is some controversy over the ownership of specific pieces in the collection. Regardless, the British Museum is a beacon of cultural and historical knowledge that inspires. I’ve been to the museum multiple time and come away more and more impressed by the permanent collection and the special exhibits. One of the current exhibits, on Troy, is a fascinating take on a classical story; weaving together both legend and fact into a comprehensive exhibit of classical and modern artistic representations of the fabled story. Well worth the extra cost for the exhibit; otherwise the museum is free (but excepts small donations from visitors).  Keep in mind this is a very large museum and would realistically take more than a day to do it justice; the highlights, however, are manageable with 2-3 hours time.",the most amazing museum
"December 28, 2019",I know that people complain and say that a lot of the stuff was from other countries and should be given back but I think that because its here at the British museum it was preserved so well and taken such good care of. Probably in the native country it would have been looted and ransacked and destroyed or never maintained due to lack of funds etc. but that being said i think the collection is wonderful. From the Athens Acropolis artifacts to the Rosetta Stone all were presented so well and all for free. So its a joy to be among so many artifacts from so many countries and to see it showcased and categorized so well. I did give a donation to them coz i was impressed with their works.,Sad decline of a once great institution
"December 14, 2019","It's been a couple of years since I last visited this precious place and how it has gone down hill! From the overkill of the security barriers and checks, then straight into a row of people lined up to take your fiver ""donation"", then the highly overpriced cloakroom, 2 pounds for a basic map, 6 for a guide, and the final straw 22 pounds!!! for the exhibition on Troy. Shame, shame, shame on you, whoever's decided on this money grabbing policy. Hey guys, you are custodians of these treasures, which were robbed all over the world, let's face it. How can ordinary British people and visitors gain rightful access to what belongs to us all. I won't be back to be robbed by the old colonial, imperial power. Good luck from a proud Irish woman!",A must see in London
"December 9, 2019","A great wow for all the artifacts from around the world which is in this museum. You can learn so many things and be mesmerized by the vast number of artifacts in this museum. I personally loved the Egypt collection of mummies, tombs, statues and other artifacts. You can take history trip of the whole world when visiting this museum. If you are not in a hurry you will need a whole day to see the museum.",The best museum in the world!
"December 2, 2019","I was told by a man older and more knowledgeable than I that the British Museum has the largest and best collection in the world. I can only say I was impressed and I loved it. It is free so why not go and see real mummies, check out the Rosetta Stone that helped humanity decipher the Egyptian hieroglyphics, among other countless artifacts from whichever time in history interests you. It is the history of mankind and lost civilizations in one museum. Plus it is a good place to walk around and reflect. If nothing else remember it’s free and go for one hour.",One of the Best in the World
"November 30, 2019","Due to limited time, we hit up the best collections per the Museum's recommendations and was glad we did.  The highlight of course was the Rosetta Stone.

I always have mixed feelings in museums as I sometime think of them as plundered goods from other nations or stealing from people's grave, but the magnificence that you see of the ingenuity and creative ability  of our species shines like a beacon.I will be going back this trip for a third day and I wonder if that will even be enough time.....",Tours
"May 19, 2019",We took 4 Bible tours here. It was such an informative experience.  I felt like we learn so much more than just wandering thru the museum on our own.  I highly recommend bible tours.com. Matt was the best tour guide.  Meander tours also did a great job but the tours were larger and not as intimate. ,Crowded but worth a visit for the best of the best ancient artifacts of world history!

I used their website to see what was highlighted with the room location number and created a list so I could at least have a plan. It is an overwhelmingly huge museum and that strategy paid off. The museum location is at the picturesque and historic Trafalgar Square, very convenient to the Underground, Leicester Square/West End shows, restaurants galore. The museum as are all of the museums in London is absolutely free. Special exhibitions are an extra charge but there’s plenty of free art to explore! We did pay a little extra (2 for 1 through our Underground weekly pass) to see the Sorolla Spanish Impressionist exhibit which was fabulous and came with a lecture. Go- you won’t regret it!",Overwhelming
"May 8, 2019",You could easily spend a couple of days in the British Museum and not see everything.  I would recommend studying what you want to see before you go especially if you were going with children or teenagers so that you get to all the galleries that you want to go through. This Museum is chock-full of antiquities and history from all over the globe so it is definitely worth going if you were visiting London plus it’s free!!!,Busy brits

I downloaded Tourblink that had 120 minute your with ""a selection of outstanding artifacts"". You get the essentialls that way otherwise it might get a bit overwhelming. Amazing museum with good displays and storytelling. I like the fact that one museum hold so many artifacts from so many different cultures but on the same time it feel a bit awkward with so much from so many places.

I finally returned after many years with a simple goal: the revisit the Elgin Marbles. It's difficult to put into words the importance of being able to visit them ... (just as it's difficult to rationalize why they remain in London rather than being repatriated)... and that alone would be a reason to visit. In addition, though, there are treasures at every turn from the Rosetta Stone to the Lewis cheesmen to the Staffordshire Hoard. At every turn there's a well stocked place to have a cuppa and a sweet to insure that you stay fresh. Allow time.",I’m sure it’s interesting but...
"February 10, 2019",I’m sure this place is full of interesting and cool things but I’m afraid my experience was terrible. The museum is just rammed wall to wall with people so you can barely see the exhibits then there’s the gift shop... Unbelievable! I found a few things I wanted and ventured to the till when the trouble began. Would you believe I dared to try and pay with Scottish money? Not Chinese or Russian but Scottish. I was told “We can’t accept that” Apparently because the till girl hadn’t seen sterling from Scotland she wouldn’t accept it. Ridiculous!  Utterly farcical!! How about properly training staff in cash handling positions? The lady in the tiny cafe down the road had no problem with Scottish money.,The best museum in the world!

"November 17, 2019","Brought a neighbour here for her first visit to the BM. She was very keen to see the third floor Egyptian exhibits. Much enjoyed - but - peace was shattered within 20mins by hordes of schoolchildren. 2 schools, both from Tower Hamlets, had badly behaved children, a handful or so each but they endangered others - and us - by running around, shouting, flash photography, swinging each other by the backpack, knocking into people including my chum who has mobility issues. The accompanying adults were either oblivious or unwilling to deal with the problems. I hasten to add, most of the children were well behaved and well escorted. Children need education but we adults also have rights too. I felt sad for a number of people who had made a journey to the BM and had their visit spoiled. What about overseas visitors...what on Earth impression would they have got? Do schools get guidance from museums? Do the children get advised of expected standard of behaviour?Our suggestion is: the BM reserves one weekday each week for no organised school visits. Publicises the school free day and then we adults get choices. I for one am fed up with not seeing the Egyptian exhibits because kids are lying all over the floor in front of displays. Plus the noise, plus being pushed, it’s just not safe or pleasant. This needs sorting out.",Beautiful

"November 2, 2019",This is an iconic museum and a must see while in London. There is only one Rosetta Stone. Their collection of ancient artifacts is unrivaled except perhaps for those things that are still in situ and in Egypt. So much has been lost to destruction and war - particularly in the Middle East in recent years - this museum holds on to some of the evidence of humanity's past.,Off season but still crowded.
"October 24, 2019","Wonderful museum with so many treasures.  Loved the friezes from Athens but really wondered if they should be here.  From what I was able to see of the Rosetta Stone, it was amazing.  Don't miss this site, but pack some patience.",Unparalleled Exhibits
"October 20, 2019",Let me just say this - I believe this is probably one of the greatest museums in the world with unbelievable historical exhibits. We just happened to go in July and it was a cluster with crowds and noise and the hustle and bustle diminished our experience. The museum is worth taking your time and really exploring. It was just too busy for us to really be able to do that and enjoy it. If you're in London 100% you should visit but be aware that in Summer it will be mobbed.,Amazing Museum
"October 16, 2019","We visited on a Saturday and it wasn't too crowdy.If you are visiting the firts couple of times, I would recommend to take a tour or something, because the museum is too big.They have everything you want to see, and you can easily get lost there.We went for 3 hours and it wasn't enough, so you can easily spend a whole morning here.They have bathrooms and the museum is free, although you can donate some money.Tours are paid though.",Wonderfull visit - take free guidet tours
"October 18, 2018",British Museum has so much to offer and so many different collections from all over the world. We had especially a wonderfull experience participating in the free guidet tour through the Greek history of Parthenon. Thank you to our guide Rosemary for making the remains from Parthenon vived and exciting. Based on this we higly recommend participating in these tours by the voluntary guides. ,This review is of the BRITISH MUSEUM COURT CAFE not available to choose on TA
"October 17, 2018","This is one of the worst restaurants in London. It was convenient so we lunched here mid way through our day at the Museum. I had a Caesar salad which had about two pounds of chicken and virtually no lettuce. Also no croutons so I went over to the serving desk and asked for some. He gave me a pasta bowl full of just croutons so I went from none to about 150. My husband ordered a different salad but they brought a mozzarella and tomato one by mistake. She took it back to the serving desk and I watched as she dropped the mozzarella, which rolled along most of the counter before she picked it up with her hand and put it back on the plate. No-one could speak English so we struggled to be understood when we needed to query the food, and the person preparing the food wasn't wearing anything resembling cooks clothing. I have a feeling it was someone drafted in to help out who had no clue and did not look like cleanliness was something he was bothered about.British Museum is a 15/10 place, but don't on any account waste your money in here.",Quick Trip Through the Antiquities of the World
"October 14, 2018",There is simply nothing else like this. See what you saw in pictures from World Civilization class face to face. There is only one Rosetta Stone. At least things taken are now shared. ,Best display in the world
"October 1, 2018",The British Museum is a must location for all visitors to London. I think the diplays are perhaps best in the world. I recommend that a visitor should plan 3 hours and limit the viewing to specific rooms. This way it will be enjoyable and learning.,High Teah was fantastic

"September 24, 2018","Not a great day out, really awful wheelchair facilities. Lift at front unmanned and unloved. Once inside fighting for lift space and no automatic doors (too heavy to open in wheelchair). meant I couldn't independently enjoy this place.",Free tours are excellent
"August 31, 2018","This place is huge with so much to see. It can be overwhelming. The best advice is to get there early and pick up the schedule of free ‘eye opener’ tours that they offer throughout the day. They tend to overlap so you can’t do them all, but you can manage four (maybe even five) if you plan well. They are given by volunteers and are usually very informative. If you are lucky enough to be able to visit on multiple occasions then try and do one gallery per visit so you can really take it all in. If you have only one day take time to decide what you want to see. Trying to cram in everything is impossible.  ",I can actually find my way around this museum
"August 30, 2018","Great museum!! It is set up quite logically, with plenty of good directions to find whatever you want to see. I've been to all the great museums in Europe and this is my favorite. ",Great place for anyone who loves history (even a little)
"August 30, 2018","I visited during the hottest summer in 40+ years and even though this museum like the others in London didn’t have AC, it was still great. The sheer number of artifacts and historical items was astounding. Both of my teenage boys love history so it was a perfect place to take them. We didn’t spend a ton of time in any one area and the crowds were thick but we still managed to see it all in about 3 hours but again, we skimmed over some areas and didn’t linger long. You can absolutely do it in a morning/afternoon as 1/2 of a day’s agenda or if you don’t mind missing some of the stuff, you could even do it faster. Obviously there is plenty for history buffs to gawk at for many, many hours so if you’re that, plan for a day with a break in one of the cafe’s. ",Beautiful museum but super crowded
"August 26, 2018","This museum has some outstanding exhibits and the staff does a wonderful job in assisting visitors.  The line for entry through security was quite long.  Once entering the gate, families with children were sent down a separate line with a much shorter wait.  As a parent - Thank you British Museum!  Once inside, navigating through multitudes of tourists proved challenging at times and we had a few conversations about proper museum manners because proper examples were few and far between.  The showcase exhibits were almost impossible to see.  A favorite however was the King's Gallery which was not crowded and very peaceful.  It was a beautiful room full of treasured books, art and collections of specimens from around the world.   ",WOW!!!
"January 18, 2019",Amazing museum that I visited 2x during my 12 day stay in London!! Top notch museum! Loved it- especially the ancient Egypt section. I took several of the free guided tours.  There’s a cloak room to drop off your coat and plenty of places to eat inside! Highly recommend!!! ,School topic
"January 12, 2019",My sons topic at school this term is Egyptians so took a visit while visiting London. A lovely museum. Not so much interest to our 5 year old but she did enjoy looking at the mummys. Lots to see. We only paid a flying visit so hope to visit again one day and spend longer as so much to see.,a real success after its renovattion
"January 10, 2019","so pleasnt to be in the glass covered courtyard with its shops, cafes and reception desks; the galleries are often renovated with atste ! I love the Sutton hoo treasure, and the sumerian galleries among others: you can exit by the north entrance and walk to bloomsbury or to coram fields, a small museum of an orphanage patroned by Fielding, haendel and captain coram; you will find shops and cafes at the south entrance",Beautiful building 
"January 6, 2019","The architecture inside this building was a highlight. The displays were not really my thing and i did question how appropriate it was for valuable antiquities from Greece and Eygpt to be sitting in London, but i can see why people who love ancient history would enjoy the place. The toilets were disgusting and it was very crowded too!",🏛Best History Teacher⏳
"January 4, 2019","This is a great Museum, a teacher of human history from ancient times until today.Paths are well defined, starting from the most ancient civilizations, passing through the Phoenicians, Etruscans, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, up to today 's society.You can admire countless relics of every civilization, well preserved and of great value. All accompanied by detailed descriptions on uses, customs, wars, the arts of every civilization.Some rooms are home to beautiful remains of ancient buildings, like some temples recomposed in their originality.The library area is rich in fossils and other curious and interesting objects, such as the first instruments for measuring time and stars.Even here the entrance is free, some shows are paid and you can make a donation to the exit.This Museum absolutely deserves a visit, as it makes possible a fast learning of what has been the history of man from the dawn of his knowledge up to today's human society, with all its peculiarities.",Huge
"December 4, 2018","Was here only half an hour, seen the rosetti stone and the Egyptian part of the Museum. Planning to come back again. Beautiful and huge building.",An American in London!
"November 25, 2018","This museum is extremely overwhelming, therefore, may I suggest planning out a section that you would prefer to see before going. It is absolutely impossible to see all the exhibits in one visit. I went strictly to view the Rosetta Stone the Greek artifacts. I spent approximately two hours reading and taking in these two exhibits. I am looking forward to my next trip to London and another visit to this awesome museum!",Arrive with a Plan and See the Highlights!
"November 20, 2018","The British Museum is full of treasures from across the world.  You could spend an entire day here and only begin to appreciate the depth and breadth of the collection.  It is perhaps the finest collection of artifacts anywhere in the word. We had allocated 3 hours to tour the museum and we were able to see everything that we wanted to see because we had mapped out a plan.Be sure to check out the museum's website before you arrive and become familiar with the collections and what you most want to see while you're there.  We purchased a guidebook that had a map of the museum (maps are not free at the museum) and planned our trip in advance.  It is had to overstate just how massive the building is.  Without a plan, you'll just end up wondering around like a zombie following wandering crowds from room to room.We arrived just after 2:30 and we were able to do everything we wanted to do by the time the museum closed at 5:30.  We didn't have to rush either.  In fact, we were able to ""walk through"" all of the museum; meaning we saw the different areas and collections, but didn't stop to admire every piece or read every plaque.  However, we did see much more in 3 hours than we expected (on top of the highlights that were our ""must-see"").The museum has a sit down café that looked nice and overlooks the central lobby.  They also have some stands where you can buy snacks and drinks.  They have several gift shops around the lobby area where you can buy souvenirs.We did have to queue for about 15 minutes or so to get inside the museum.  The queue is for security, not tickets as the museum is free.  If you have time in London, the museum is a must-see.",It’s become a circus
"October 25, 2018","I’ve never before felt the need to leave the British museum. I couldn’t quite believe how much it has changed since I last came here, a year ago. You can no longer just walk in from the front of the building, which is really quite an important part of the experience. You have to weave your way through huge amounts of metal fences to get to an outdoor bag check that was about as friendly as airport control. There was absolutely no need for it as if there wasn’t a huge queue. However, surprisingly, once inside it was so busy you couldn’t actually see anything!! I’ve never seen it so busy before. I went on a Thursday in order to avoid the Friday tourist crush, but apparently the British museum is now just a place tourists go to take photos of everything in hoards. Merely a year ago you could see things. Which is surely the whole point of even going!Now it’s comoletely unenjoyable for a Londoner to go there.What a shame.",A must see...countless times!
"October 19, 2018","The British Museum has something for everyone...of all ages. Entrance is free although special exhibits charge and the charges can be quite steep. The current exhibit on dissident art is fascinating and well worth the money. We spent several hours looking and reading about art through the ages that creative and clever people have used to express their dislike, opposition, and scorn for political leaders and regimes. Towards the end of the exhibit look out for Banksy piece...genius.",So busy!!!!
"August 19, 2018",We went today and was delighted to discover that it was free entry!It was absolutely rammed full of people. Pushing and shoving in every room.The museum itself was very clean and the staff were very welcoming.Bags are checked before you enter. You can not take food and drink in with you. There are cafes where you can buy food and drink and plenty of toilets - but be prepared to queue for 25 mins to use the loo.The most interesting part is where all the Egyptian mummies are. Fantastic section. The rest we found very boring.There are no interactive areas and we found ourselves walking around and then left pretty quickly.We did sit at the cafe outside for a drink and a snack which was very nice ,"DO THIS: ""Before the museum opens: an introduction to ancient Egypt""  Rating: 10 of 5!!!!!"
"August 19, 2018","We cannot give a high enough ranking to the hour we spent with our guide in the Ancient Egypt area before the museum opened. Our small group of 18, led by a highly knowledgeable museum docent, enjoyed an entire hour alone in this area.We were able to avoid the throngs of people around the Rosetta Stone once the museum opened. After it opened, the place was an absolute zoo. The audio guide line was eternal. Moving in and out of different areas was a madhouse. Once our tour was over, we spent another hour dodging other visitors and hit the highlights on the Things to see list provided on the free museum map.I would spend even more money for more time with a guide before the museum opened. Incredible experience and highlight of the trip for all 4 of us, ages 18-58!",Amazing 
"August 19, 2018","I always go back to the British as the collection itself is amazing. It would be worth it just for the Rosetta Stone or the Assyrian part, but for lovers of history it has endless things to offer (leaving aside discussions as to whether or not some things should be returned to their home countries).A must see. Planning the visit helps but otherwise you can also decide to stroll around and get lost. ","Great building, great history; so much to see, so plan your time"
"August 19, 2018","There can be little doubt that the British Museum is one of the world’s greatest.  The building itself is spectacular, if understated from the street.  Lord Norman Foster’s dome, installed over the Millennium is particularly impressive (for American visitors, this is the same guy who designed the glass ceiling over the courtyard at the Smithsonian Museum of American Art and National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC).  The collection is mind-blowing.  From the Rosetta Stone to Anglo-Saxon burial hoards, there is so much too see. For me, some of the highlights include the Assyrian Sculptures - these are particularly valuable as many have been destroyed in the Syrian Civil War.  Also well-worth seeing is the Sutton Hoo Hoard - a treasure trove recovered from an Anglo-Saxon burial mound in Suffolk, England.  My personal favorites, though, are the Lewis Chessmen - carved in the 12th century from Walrus ivory with fantastic detail and character; they were re-discovered almost 200 hundred years ago on the Island of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of North-West Scotland. Here are a few suggestions that I have found useful for dealing with the size of the collection and other facts of life with large Museums I have visited.Like all great public museums in any major city (London, Paris, New York), security screening is a fact of life - it is essential for our safety.  You will need to plan a little additional time for the line to get through security.  The collection is vast and is spread over several floors and wings around the Millennium Courtyard.  So it’s worth taking a few minutes to sit in the Millennium Courtyard and plan your visit - what do you want to see the most?  Unless you have most of the day, you will need to be a little ruthless about selecting some key highlights that will be your personal priorities.  The Museum’s map suggests some highlights and there are staff in every room who can help direct you to your next must-see.  London’s Museums are built to keep visitors warm and dry in colder months.  This means it can be a bit warm inside, particularly at the height of the summer tourist season.  So plan on taking it gently (you’re likely on holidays anyway aren’t you?) or slimming down your list of must-sees.  For example, prepare to wait a few moments to get a clear view of the Rosetta Stone.  The British Museum will get almost as busy as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York or the Louvre in Paris but it’s worth the wait.  This is a must-see collection, one of the world’s finest.  ",Security Threat
"August 16, 2018",The major problem in all these venues is the employment of second rate customer services on the cheap who provide 'security'. They have no customer training and make the whole 'experience' dismal once you are herded through some plastic antechamber. The oversight of the trustees of the place is dismal and offers a poor representation to the world.,Great experience 
"August 10, 2018",The attention for families is extraordinary!Lovely place to hide from chaos and rain just for families at floor -1Where is Tutankhamun???,Recent visit on Sunday.
"August 6, 2018","To be avoided at all cost!!The queuing started on the pavement along the walls of the Museum. Some tourist became aggressive,probably frustrated at the poor organising of the crowds. The numbers of visitors, their selfie taking activities made any serious viewing impossible. The ladies loos had a 30 min plus wait.Unfortunately we rated the visit as a complete waste of time.",One of the best
"July 9, 2018",This must be one of the best museums I have ever been in. There is just so much to see. Absolutely worth a stop if you are in London.,Simply amazing
"June 28, 2018","This museum it is just amazing, it must be the most important collection to understand humankind.There are so many treasures and iconic pieces of history that you can be there forever. It is a huge museum, so prepare your visit, you could be around 2 hours...or the whole day.  Audioguide is a must, with you will seize the opportunity to visit.Special recognition for a free admission, this is something remarkable in an over-marketed world.",Worst musuem i’ve visited
"June 18, 2018","What a waste!Although there are very impressive pieces on display that was the worst museum visit of my lifeExhibits are messy, not even put together.For example to visit the Egyptian collection you have sculptures on ground floor then mummies on the top floor in a room behind medieval pieces and a third part on the other side of the museum!The atmosphere is more like you are visiting a farm fair with lots of noise, people everywhere and just a global messy display of art pieces instead of cows or goatsIndications inside the museum are as eratic as the rest.For example to access the roman antic sculptures turn left at the entrance where the sign indicates cloak room and pizzeria only!Well pizza is from Italy so the connection is obvious maybe?!The pieces on display are very poorly treated as well. It is shocking to see over 5000 year old relics being left right there for everyone to lean on or touch.Finger marks and stains are plenty on the egyptian or assyrians statues.That just reinforces the feeling the museum gives of not giving a damn about conserving what is on display or respect to vistors and making the place enjoyable to visit.The shop is full of way overpriced stuff made in chinaOk there is a lot of people, but if the museum would enforce a policy of relative silence and respect for the pieces on display then it would be a great place to visitAs it is now with what feels like thousands of chinese tourists groups at the same time all shouting and crowding around the displays making it impossible to see anything untill they are gone, the museum is clearly a place to avoidToo bad because the collection they have is clearly impressiveAlso the lack of clear visiting route and will to organize proper tours makes you feel like England displays every notable prize it took back home from around the world and the museum is not intended to show history but war prizes.Forget tour guides, they are free yes but run just a few times during the day and the museum is so noisy you won’t hear what the guide say anyway. (We tried two times)I enquired about private tour guide, they are not available even with advance booking or whatever money you are ready to pay they just won’t do it.Also, as nearly everything in London, you have the few guided tour of some galleries right at the same time as every other activities in london, namely 11am and 1.30 or 2pmIn fact London is a big city but as each and every spot to visit has the same timing for guided tours you can’t visit properly more than one or two place per day.All in all that museum was the biggest disapointment of our trip.Will return the day order and respect is restored there....Most likely never then....",Distressing
"June 2, 2018",The museum was very huge and very clean. But they don't have something to show us! They don't have history. They collect the civilisation of other counties to show!,Astonishing
"April 7, 2018",A must to go! An history and world special  tour !!Lot of rooms with art pieces from.all the world and all the times,Sunday trip 
"April 1, 2018",There should be a limit of how many people are let  in to this museum How anyone is meant to see anything when you are squashed in like sardines  is beyond me .Also just outside the museum should not be a smoking establishment .Some people might like to sit outside to get fresh air without breathing in smoke !!!,"Sadly, you have let yourselves down"
"February 24, 2018","How I would have loved to give this amazing venue five stars for being an outstanding free museum attracting visitors from across the world with brilliant speakers leading guided tours.Alas, you fell down on the basics.  It was very cold outside.  There was a long queue for the necessary security check.  Once inside, a call of nature was necessary.  The wall display led me to the nearest toilet.  For some reason, it was closed.  That's one star lost.  Back to the wall display to find the second nearest toilet.  For some reason, it was also closed.  Another star lost.  Back to the wall display to find the third nearest toilet which required some of my finest navigation skills to locate a tiny door halfway up a staircase.  This toilet was hardly the most convenient.  It was a small room which was packed owing to the other toilets being closed.  Almost another star lost but I will give you the benefit of the doubt.  This was very bad planning to have the two main toilets closed at the same time.My final complaint was the poor signage.  I spent ages trying to locate the rooms and displays.  In fact, I reckon that I spent a longer time looking for what I wanted to see than the time I spent enjoying looking at what I wanted to see.  That's another star lost.Two pieces of work required please:1. Have a plan that if you are going to close one main toilet, make sure that the other one is fully operational;2. Find a willing helper who is not familiar with the layout of the museum and ask them to find their way to certain rooms and you will discover that the signage needs improving.",spectacular museum
"February 11, 2018",this wonderful museum need many visits. there is so much to see & do here. always busy . the staff are very helpful & friendly with directions & information.,Some spectacular exhibits
"February 11, 2018",The reason for four stars rather than five is the toilets. I have rarely been to somewhere with such totally disgusting toilets.There are some world-unique exhibits that have to be seen from Rodin’s Thinker to the Rosetta Stone to the Elgin Marbles (that must seriously annoy any Greek people that see them). There are mummies and sarcophaguses galore that leave you in open-mouthed astonishment.The building within a building structure is an architectural delight.Think I would try to go back during the week rather than at a weekend when it is heaving.The restaurant seemed far better than the cafe and at £16 for fish and chips seemed like better value than the cafe too.,Fabulous - as expected
"February 5, 2018","Visited with husband and son while in London for a concert. Stayed a few streets away in freezing cold weather and wanted to spend a morning under cover. None of us had visited the British Museum before, oddly, and knew less than we should have about it. We loved it: it has so many stunning collections. We headed first to the Egyptology exhibitions as we're all big fans of ancient Egypt. There was plenty to see, including several mummies. There are bigger collections elsewhere, in the Louvre in Paris and in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, but this one is very accessible and easy to see in a relatively short time. There are excellent ancient Greek and Roman collections too. We wanted to see the Rothschild exhibition, and were impressed with that. Apart from the exhibits, and the comprehensive information provided, there are lovely cafe areas, with good coffee and extremely tempting cakes, as well as baguettes and sandwiches. Great museum.",It is FREE and you SHOULD visit this Museum!
"December 15, 2017","There is a security check before entering the museum. Sometimes the line could be really long, good thing we went there just as it opened at 10:00 am.  CHEAT: There is an entrance at the side (i think left) of the museum where there is no line. The place is so huge you need more than an hour to see everything. They have a lot of valuable colllections from around the world.",A GREAT MUSEUM
"November 19, 2017",I visited the British Museum four times.It remains a WONDERFUL experience!I cannot succeed in saying better.,Amazing
"August 22, 2017","Incredibly amazing museum! You could come here every day for a week and still not see everything. Reserve AT LEAST half a day.Yes, there are always a lot of people, but it is free after all. I recommend renting an audio guide with tour suggestions.",Simply. Outstanding.
"August 13, 2017",Thank you British Museum for the excellent work being done to keep the world's treasures safe and well-preserved. Visited last 20 years ago and loved seeing all the progress made in refreshing the displays. Cafes were excellent and well-priced. Appreciated the top 10 list for the time challenged. ,Must visit
"August 10, 2017","Must visit Museum. Enter by the 2nd entrance on the back of the building (less queues). If you want to see treasures from all over the world, this is the place.",Quick tip to avoid the queues
"August 9, 2017","I visited the British Museum recently to see the Hokusai exhibition to find long queues outside of the Great Russel Street entrance waiting for a bag check.  I was thankful that I had a exhibition ticket which enabled me to avoid the queues.For anybody who does plan to visit, that there is another entrance on Montague Place at the rear of the museum which is much quieter.  If you use that entrance you might save yourself 30 minutes or so which you can use to enjoy the many fantastic items on display.",Extensive collection
"August 8, 2017","The collection is very extensive and overwhelming. Make sure you know which period you would like to visit and make that a priority. The crowds in August are huge. I recommend getting there early, at the start of the day.",HORRIBLE 
"July 27, 2017","This museum is dirty,  crowded and hot. I am appalled to see people touching exhibits. Not one employee in site and if you did see one they were on their phone! Do yourself a favor-- charge admission fee. Maybe you get more people working to clean and do their job.  All the Greek artifacts need to be back in Greece! I don't recommend this place at all. ",Greal Collection
"July 20, 2017","Great Museum! Greek Section is probably the best.When I visited it had showcased the Cloth of Sri Sri Simanta Sankardev (A religious preachger of Assam) which was a treat.Numismatic section was a little disappointing for me, otherwise it's indeed a great museum.",Always a treat
"June 2, 2017",We have been there many times and it is always a feast for the mind. Do not miss it. The Egyptian collection..the best!!!,BEST MUSEUM IN ENGLAND
"June 1, 2017","This is the best museum in London and one of the top five in the world-------the Rosetta stone, the sculpture and friezes from the Parthenon, the Lewis chess set, Sutton Hoo, Horus, and much more","Rosetta Stone! Egypt, Nevina, Babolyn, other historical highlights"
"May 30, 2017","Perhaps the best world history museum in it.  The British Empires and indeed the worlds oldest purely museum.  Well worth setting aside at least a 1/2 day.  We arrived at 5pm on a day that it was open until 8pm (Fridays) so we had to rush and only do a few areas.  Glad I didn't swing the ""American Pop"" exhibit because you don't come to England to view Warhol exhibits (do you???).  Bottom-line stick with the history and stay away from the political history rewriting stuff and you will have a great day in this incredible museum.",A must see when visiting London. 
"May 10, 2017","This is excellently an curated museum filled with numerous famous works. Although having a grand exterior, it's very easy to navigate and doesn't take 3 weeks to get through like the Louvre in Paris. ",Rosetta Stone and a whole lot more
"September 7, 2016",Visiting the museum was at the top of our list and it did not disappoint.  And free.  I wish US museums were free.,Fantastic Egyptian and Greek Collection
"September 7, 2016",You hear so mush about the Egyptian and Greek antiquities collection.  The collection is even better.   We were also fortunate to see the Sunken Cities - Egypt's lost worlds which enhanced our trips and provided a greater understanding of how Egyptian and Roman civilizations merged.,Humongous collection of cool stuff
"September 1, 2016","It's what you might expect-- a ton of amazing artifacts & exhibits-- but it's great nonetheless. I'd reserve at least several hours per visit to make it worth your while. At least admission is free (thanks, London!) so you can spread your experience across multiple visits if desired.",Not worth the time.
"July 13, 2016","Very full and poorly ventilated. Accosted by rude security staff searching bags for no good reason. Building full (FULL!) of tourist groups with no sense of personal space. Seems to be no capacity at which they close the doors. A shame, as I'm sure it's very interesting, but a hoard of sweaty Yanks all shouting at each other to ""come an' lekkit diss"" really ruins ones day.","Incredible museum. Unfortunately, it should be avoided..."
"July 11, 2016","I have been there three times, once in the ""distant past"", circa 1987 (to be honest, cant even recall this first visit).  More recently, I had the opportunity to visit this great museum in Jan 2015 and July 2016. Sadly, both experiences were horrible, for the museum was incredibly overcrowded. The level of noise and commotion made the entire experience meaningless even though for my last attempt I arrived just as the museum opened! I had hopes this strategy would work, but I suppose world tourism is now so huge that it is impossible to go to this museum and not face an enormous crowd. I love going to museums and have visited some of the most famous ones, but have never had any experience remotely close to these two visits. I’m sad to say that the British museum was one of the few negative experiences I had while in London.  Waste of time, much rather visit the V&A or The Wallance Collection...",Top notch museum
"June 21, 2016",We just arrived in London from Paris and asked our local hosts about sights to see. It was great to know some museums remain free to the public. Easy to get to by underground subway. The crowd was manageable. Wonderful works of art and history abound . Helpful staff. I didn't feel overwhelmed unlike the louvre. We just didn't have time to see the exhibitions. A must see for tourists and locals alike.,Easy to Find and Tour
"June 2, 2016",This museum has some truly amazing artifacts. The Assyrian pieces were mind-boggling. The employees were helpful and the gift shop was top notch. They even sell postage stamps!,You need a whole day... or three
"May 7, 2016","I've been to three major museums (including this one) and each one has its ""thing"" that it offers. If you go just for the Rosetta Stone you're in for a cool treat. However, I doubt you'd be able to just walk in and walk out, because there is a lot to see. There's a lot of Old Testament history from Assyria and other empires from that time that was neat to see. There was also a lot of Ancient Greek and Roman exhibits. I went through it for three hours and only saw half of it. I'd love to go back. ",THE Museum.
"February 28, 2016","So much of the world's treasures are housed under this roof, it is in my opinion an absolute must-see on any trip to London.  I came here straight from Heathrow.   Vast, and completely amazing.  The freaking Rosetta Stone is here.  'Nuff said.  Admission is even free!!!    NO excuse to miss this amazing museum",Great place to spend a day to learn
"February 12, 2016","Love this musuem. It's free of charge, contains amazing artifacts and is well maintained. I urge visitors to give back at least a token sum as money is needed to run this lovely musuem.I enjoyed taking my time walking through all the rooms and picking up new things (not literally of course). There are people stationed in various rooms with artifacts you can touch and feel while they explain to you in detail about the item. Thumbs up! ",A visit to look forward to!
"June 18, 2015","Entrance to the museum is free, but if you want to see some of their special exhibitions there is a fee. I went on a Sunday before the opening time at 10 a.m. and parts of the building were already open to the public. The Rosette Stone was very popular but there is plenty to see...a very wide range of exhibitions....from across all the continents. You will not be disappointing!!","Full of History,, but who's history?"
"February 18, 2015",You need at least a week to see all as there are millions of historical things to see at the British Museum.. Mostly the things stolen from other countries! Arthemis Temple was stolen from our country and it should return to the lands where it is belongs to be and many other things from other countries!,endless
"February 15, 2015","Have to visit in 3 days because very rich place.I loved egyptian room, medieval room and middle-east room.Extrem orient's room was beautiful!!!I loved this museum!!!",Give yourself as much time as possible
"February 12, 2015","Words just do no justice for the British Museum. It is simply the most awe inspiring museum I have every visited. The collections are just breathtaking. I could easily have spent an entire week there. My advice would be to get a guide book on arrival, sit down and have a cup of coffee in the  court cafe and spend half an hour planning your tour. You just wont have time to visit everything so be selective. I checked the website after i visited the museum which was an error as there is a useful facility to allow you to plan your visit on-line - www.britishmuseum.org. The architecture of the building is also worthy of note. I particularly like the glass roof!","Charge for entry and pay more to staff, who know what's going on."
"February 8, 2015","At the subsidiary entrance in Montague Street, there was a list of timed activities, with the instruction to go to the ticket desk for tickets and locations.  At the ticket desk, the woman said there was no such thing and she had no such tickets.Feedback.  Either train the staff or pull down out of date notices.There were large numbers of people just loitering and having conversations in closed circles (none of them looking at exhibits).If you charged for entry, you'd be able to pay enough to get staff who knew what was going on in the museum.  And the museum would be used less like a last choice loitering/getting out of the rain place for people who've got nothing better to do.A museum's job is more than providing free lavatories and a cheap caff for everyone, who passes by.  There are plenty of eateries in the area, so there is no need for the museum to compete with them.",Nothing british
"February 7, 2015","A lot of things in there was not british , though we would see how the great empire was , seeing the iron age and railways",Gives me butterflies
"December 27, 2014",Please do not pass up the British Museum. It was the highlight of my trip. I would fly back to London just to go back to to this Museum. Truly wonderful. And I'm still heartbroken I didn't get to see everything.,"If possible, visit several times"
"November 15, 2014","The museum is free, except for special exhibits.  If you have the time, visit more than once for a couple of hours and return to another portion.  There is WAY too much to take in during one visit.  If you only have time for one visit, talk to the information staff and they can direct you to the areas of your interest.  It is an incredible museum - one of the best in London.","Hot, boring and crowded"
"August 28, 2014","I know this is very subjective, but I thought the majority of the tour was boring. There were only a few things that were interesting. This place is so big, I thought we would never get through it. There was still a lot that we didn't see. It was SO crowded, and very HOT. No A/C in most of the rooms. That made it even harder to enjoy. i just wanted to get out of there asap.",Filled with Amazing History!
"August 5, 2014","Wow, this place is big and filled with so many amazing artifacts from history. There are mummies, samurais, a rosetta stone, what's not to love? A must see when in London.Tips:- Entrance is free but there are many places to leave a donation.- It is hot inside during the summer. I don't believe London believes in air-conditioning, which can make for quite an uncomfortable experience. Use the map as a fan.- There are bathrooms, and there are large lines for those bathrooms. Did I mention it's even hotter in the bathrooms?- This place is so big that you will not be able to see it all on one visit. Pick the most important things you want to see, or wander around aimlessly enjoying all the amazing artifacts, but do not put pressure on yourself to see it all.- There are multiple places to get food. It is fine. There are even vegetarian options. - There are tons of gift stores. - There are so many stairs! Be prepared for a workout. In the heat, because as I previously stated, London does not believe in air-conditioning, or cold drinks.",VIKINGS - yet another badly curated BM exhibition
"March 13, 2014","Great artefacts, rubbish display.  I complained about the presentation of the last blockbuster (Herculaneum and Pompeii) - too crowded, and very badly captioned. I got a very pompuis response which basically said 'get lost, we know what we are doing'.  Well you don't chums, and you have repeated the error with The Vikings.  The problem is simple:  captions at waist level in very small point size which only one or two people at a time can read, and at that, they have to bend down to read them.   This means other people can't see into the display cases, and an unholy scrum results.   And The Vikings starts off with a series of displays where this crowding is at its worse.  The answer: simples!!  Additional eye-level captions, and multiple captions per display case - there's plenty of space to do this in this exhibition.   And do some wandering about and see how the punters are actually getting around the exhibition.  And don't be so dashed pompous 'we know best' - because you assuredly don't.  And this is a great pity, because the artefacts in this show are very interesting, and the story reasonably well told.  I was left mystified at the end, however, with a dialect voice explaining the building of the longboats (at least I think that's what it was all about) - but no explanation of what the dialect was (? Shetland) and why it was being used.  Brits and foregners alike stood around loooking confused......",British Museum
"March 12, 2014",Vikings great disappointment. Labels are at knee height but of more than 100 visitors only 3 were in wheel chairs. Labels should be at eye height. Delays in trying to read them resulted in huge blockage at the beginning. Advice - only book for a v early visit.,Too many people
"March 10, 2014","Overall the British Museum is a great place to visit with many extraordinary exhibits but please don't cram so many people in to the special exhibitions. I unfortunately I visited The Viking Exhibition at the weekend and the queues are long, by the nature of the exhibition many of the early artifacts are small and require a closer inspection. This meant many heads peering in to get a look. This was not helped by there being exhibition cabinets on both sides of the room, therefore not giving a clear path to follow. If you left the queue to look at a cabinet the other side it looked as though you were pushing in to get back in position. Also the labelling was not always clear as to which exhibit it was explaining. None of the items had numbers next to them, and not all were described seperately and so you didn't always know which was which. This wasn't helped by the writing often being at the begining of the cabinet, and there was no posibility of stepping back to reread it after you'd got to the item due to the number of people. The exhibits were of a high standard and very interesting but it was not set out for the number of people present. This may just have been my bad luck on the day, but it made a good exhibition average.",A Truly Awful Day
"March 9, 2014","We paid to see the Vikings exhibit. There are timed tickets so we assumed that they would be able to manage the flow of people going in and out to make it reasonable for people to be able to view the exhibits. We experienced the following issues which impacted our enjoyment of the day:1- Members are allowed in at any time - as this was the first weekend of the show - there were many when we were there making the gallery overly crowded.2- People who get the audio guide (we were discouraged from getting one by the ticket taker as it was ""so busy"") simply stand in front of the exhibit cases (some very small) until the audio guide finishes without any consideration for the hundreds of other people wanting to view the exhibit. Some of the audio presentations go on for several minutes. This means that one person is monopolising the space for up to 5 minutes whilst everyone else tried to peak around them. I am not sure if they are clueless or just extremely selfish but I am afraid this is what happens. We were recently on holiday & went to an exhibit where there was ""standing space"" at the front and ""channels"" for people to move freely behind as they went along - greatly improving the ease of movement for people. I think the museum should really adopt this approach for crowded galleries to improve the flow of people. We have decided that no matter how spectacular the subject matter, it is extremely unlikely we will go to another show here. They are just not worth the frustration and disappointment.",The Vikings
"March 8, 2014","Unless you enjoy queuing for an extremely long time to no avail, don't bother going to th British Museum to see this exhibition, where a timed ticket means nothing and, like us, requesting a refund in order to not waste any more time is far more preferable.","Why British?It should be called ""Greek museum"" !"
"January 24, 2014","The biggest part of the museum is covered with the Greek Sculptures.They are really beautiful,though the ""Akropolis museum"" in Athens -were they belong- is much better and newer.I also liked the egyptian exhibits,they seemed so interesting!!I didn't see anything that was british.Everything was stolen from other countries.So,why is it caled ""British museum""?The admission is free for everyone.Most museums in London are free so eveybody can visit them!","So much to see, plus they have free WiFi"
"October 16, 2013","My goal was to go see the Egyptian collection, which includes several mummies. I was not disappointed, and I found there was a lot more to see than I had time for.I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had free WiFi available.",Rude cloakroom staff
"September 10, 2013","Having visited the excellent Pompeii & Herculaneum exhibition in April, I travelled from Glasgow with a group of 36 pupils yesterday to visit it.  Since the sign said we had to leave our baggage at the cloakroom, we attempted to do this.  When we arrived there, the male attendant was extremely rude, aggressive and unhelpful.  The message he was giving (that they could not accommodate so many of us) was fair enough, but he was extremely unpleasant in his delivery of this message.  When I asked if he could suggest an alternative for us, he said ""go to a train station!"" This was not possible with 15 minutes until our time slot for the exhibition. I asked for the man's name so that I could complain, but was told they do not give out names.  The staff at the entrance of the exhibition were extremely helpful and accommodating and allowed us to take our bags in.","amazing museum, rude and distracting visitors"
"September 8, 2013","first off the main reason my girlfriend and i visited the museum was to visit the Life and Death of Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibit but we spent most of the day here so will review in two halves.The museum itself - The museum itself is amazing, the items on display are stunning to see, everything from the rosetta stone to the elgin marbles, to egyptian sarcophagi and roman frescoes, infact thee is so much to see id say you need more than a day. the fact that it is free to enter is still amazing and although donations are welcomed theyre not expected. like most tourist sites, especially somewhere like london, its advisable to get there early, in fact the earlier the better as im sure the crowds are less and you can actually get close to the exhibits with no one in front of you. you can pick up a map which helps but it only shows the theme and no listing of the actual items on display, but you can get listings for that from the museum shop.The life and death of pompeii and herculaneum exhibition - after visiting both pompeii and herculaneum last year, being a big fan of mary beard and her tv shows both my girlfriend and i were very excited to see this, especially as there are a number of items which have never been shown outside of italy before. although we had planned visiting earlier in the year work commitments meant we were unable to get down to london until september and when we came to book tickets for the exhibition the museum didnt have any for the dates we were in london so we booked through an external ticket website. the only tickets available were for an 11:50 or a 13:50 entrance so went for the 13:50. im not sure if it was because the exhibition is in its last month or that we went in the afternoon and there was lots of people from earlier entrances still there but it was packed. Im amazed that they were letting people in every 10 minutes, id of thought it would be better allowing 30-35 people in every 30 minutes as that would mean less crowding. The rudeness of some people (especially it seems the older generation surprisingly - the WI types, and also it seems that visitors from certain european countries have no manners either) amazes me, both myself and my girlfriend experienced people literally shoving in front of us (at one point one visitor had been doing this to me so much i actually told her what i thought of her), both had our feet stood on and walked into and although it clearly states that pictures are not to be taken i saw plenty of people doing so. the exhibition is great and exhibits themselves stunning and im sure everyone who is interested in the story of these two towns or roman history and has been lucky enough to visit them and this exhibition is thankful to the curator Paul Roberts for the hardwork he has done in pulling this off.for anyone thinking of visiting the museum go early, and those thinking of visiting the exhibition again try to go early but prepare to be jostled about but rude people who have no desire to actually study the exhibits but merely want to be able to say ""ive seen it"" so i would say wear steel toe capped boots and maybe use an offensive perfume or aftershave to make people steer clear of you and give you space",Need eyes in my belly button!
"May 12, 2013","Life and Death in Pompeii and HerculaneumA really wonderful exhibition somewhat spoiled by two things, the first difficult to change, the second quite simple.1. Far too crowded -- yes I know that the more people who are let in the fuller the Museum's coffers, but the numbers they let in at one time half spoils the pleasure of seeing (or struggling to see) the exhibits. It feels exploitative to find that after paying an entrance fee of a good amount of money and booking a time weeks in advance you are jammed in almost as tightly as in a rush-hour tube.2. Do curators ever think of what it's like trying to read exhibit labels that are at waist height in a crowded room? Even if your eyes were at waist level you'd not be able to read much with two to three rows of people between you and the label. I'm sure it's all very lovely when there are only three or four curators in a room admiring the aesthetics of the display's layout, but when there are 300 or so people trying to look at things it's appalling. Why, oh why, can't  labels be mounted above the exhibits? If they were 6 feet or so above the floor and in a reasonably large font people would be able to read them without bending low and peering around other people's bums.",Viking Museum
"June 12, 2014","Very disappointing exhibition - crowded and no queue or crowd control from museum staff - not sure why there was timed entry when there were such large crowds entering each time. Very difficult to read any of the information because of the crowds in front of each item and I ended up skipping some of the artefacts as I couldn't get near them - at a mere 5 foot tall, I really had no chance against some of the pushier (and taller) visitors. Given how much I spent on tickets, I am actually quite annoyed at the poor quality of this exhibition. My advice - don't bother.",Mixed Feelings
"April 26, 2014","The exhibition has two main elements - the first two rooms are small, cramped, overcrowded, and it is difficult to see anything.  People stand for ages in front of the cabinets listening to their guides.  We, got hot, tired, and frustrated, and could see little point in timed tickets, if seeing the objects was going to be so unpleasant.  Some parents were taking young children around, and it was very difficult for them to see the exhibits - even though adults were letting them through to the front.  I would not have blamed the children if they had started crying, I'm sure a lot of the adults felt just the same. Then the exhibition opens up dramatically into a large room with a Viking ship and viewing platforms.  We found that much less claustrophobic, and hot, and at last we could start to see things properly and take things in. Overall,  there are some fascinating exhibits worth seeing, and a great deal of poor curation.  We came up with a number of ways that the items could have been displayed in a more interesting and informative way. (The 2013 Pompeii exhibition was much, much better.)   Around the walls are a number of photographs and quotations - these are worth looking at. The theme of the exhibition is the Vikings penetration into Europe and Asia, and how they interacted with different cultures, but it is done in a very bitty way.  You will get more out of the exhibition if you read up something of their story beforehand -  otherwise trying to put together a framework from  the way the items are displayed will be next to impossible. Finally,  the staff are rude.   You have to follow the process exactly otherwise expect to be shouted at - there is no excuse for not knowing what the staff want you to do !!  There are no photographs allowed even without a flash,  not even the wall posters.   The good bits :-  The room with the ship,  the viking skeletons,  the wall quotes,  and seeing such a variety of items which emphasised the Viking's reach into different cultures. The poor bits:- the overcrowded rooms, the poor curation,  the loss of a 'story' of the Vikings, contextual information, rude staff. Overall - poor value for money, try and to at the start or end of the day when crowds may be less.  Do not go on a hot day !!",The Vikings need to raid it
"April 7, 2014","We visited the Viking Exhibition with high hopes. Too many people, too little to see, badly laid out. What more can I say? The Curators of this exhibition need to get their act together and display the artefacts as they deserve to be displayed. There seems to be no account made of the number of visitors already in the exhibition before the next horde are let in and this happens every 10 minutes. Some poor person was trying to wheel a pushchair round. I!m all for youngsters visiting museums but it needs to be a pleasant experience. There was no way for small children to see most of the displays as it was so crowded. I'm very tall so could at least look over the heads of most people except the descriptions for each case are only done once and placed in such a position that it causes bottlenecks with people trying to read. I became so fed up that quite frankly I gave up trying to learn anything and just looked at objects. I can't say this exhibition added much to my knowledge of the Vikings except that originating from the south of England I am unlikely to have inherited any Viking DNA. Shame, as I could have battered my way round.",British Museum : Vikings Exhibition
"April 6, 2014","I visited the Vikings exhibition on Friday with my family and we were all disappointed with the whole exhibition – adults and  children alike. In summary – far too many tickets sold so it was impossible to see anything in the first third of the exhibition (individual queues at every cabinet), and a very poorly designed exhibition, both in terms of physical space ( tiny crammed rooms at the beginning were awful, cabinets with low down small signs which meant only the people at the very front could read what they were looking at, terrible experience for those in wheelchairs) but also in the intellectual journey – no story, no theme,  no wow factor, no revelation…just nothing. It felt like an exhibition from 40 years ago and is not up to the standard we have grown to expect. My party of ten ranging in age from 11 to 52 were all equally disappointed.Our experience was shared by everyone there. The entire crowd were disgruntled, unhappy, discussing the cynicism of selling so many tickets and the poor design values. I think this is one 'blockbuster' exhibit I would recommend you avoid.",Vikings Life And Legend
"April 4, 2014","We have attended a number of the museum's exhibitions over the years and these have been very good. For example Pompeii, Terracotta Warriors and the Egyptian Book of the Dead. But this exhibition was a huge disappointment. It consists of two rooms only of poorly laid out exhibits. Most if these are very small. On the day we visited (12.30pm on 4th April 2014), the rooms were packed with people. So many were being admitted that it took ten minutes to gain entry. It was virtually impossible to see anything in detail due to the crush of people in the rooms. Give this one a miss.",Viking exhibition was great but too busy
"March 25, 2014","Visited the musuem soley to see the current Viking exhibition. This exhibition was sold out but we'd booked in advance, and you could only visit at your designated time-slot. The exhibition itself was very good, but it was just too crowded. I understand that this is a problem and I'm happy that it was so popular, but neither needed a larger hall, or admit fewer visitors and change higher fees.",Vikings?  A wee glimpse that was all!
"March 24, 2014","We visited this exhibition on Friday 14th  March at 1pm slot.  The new wing looks grand on entry but what a dreadful time we experienced on entry: a wall of people , a static queue.  Unable to see much at all. After 25 mins gave up and skipped the lot to go and see the ship.  That was better.  The whole experience was shoddy.  We are pensioners and paid 36 pounds to see this. Money aside what a let down.  Read Neil Oliver's book you will learn more.Greedy BM!  You have let your patrons down and the Vikings would have slaughtered you for this mess!",The Vikings
"March 22, 2014","Wonderful exhibition, very poor organisation.  Despite having booked a specific time for our visit we were penned in and kept waiting for half an hour and then herded through at a snail's pace.  Normally this would be a good thing - plenty of opportunities to examine the exhibits - not on this occasion, far too many people and badly laid out displays.  Things improved once you arrived at the large exhibition room with the huge Viking ship but by this time you had passed much of the exhibition.I have been fortunate enough to visit both the Museum of Copenhagen and the Roskilde Viking Museum so I know how well things could have been!",The Vikings are too crowded
"March 20, 2014","I am an archaeology buff. As a great BM fan I hate to mark it average….almost everything it does is just outstanding but the presentation of this exhibition is not good. My wife and I have seen Viking sites, artefacts and boats in Denmark, in Orkney, Dublin, York and other places so we were really looking forward to this.This exhibition has almost everything you would want to see to understand the Viking culture. It is wonderfully curated. For us the whole experience was downgraded by two factors.First. There are simply too many people there. The points about the entry clog up made in other blogs matched our experience. Second, the signage is very poor. I can understand why it needs to be a hip height for children and for those in wheelchairs, but why oh why isn't it repeated in larger print above our heads?I e-mailed the BM this morning (we visited yesterday) and was amazed to receive a rather sympathetic reply within three hours. Reading between the lines of what they said, I think they know that they have got something very wrong here…They would be better to publicly own up, close down for two days, and re-arrange the exhibition - at least the first rooms. Or at least the signage. Great pity because again, I emphasise that the contents of this exhibition and the way they tell the story are - as you would expect from the BM -  first class.",Vikings
"March 20, 2014","Like many of the other reviewers we were very disappointed by this exhibition because of the problems caused by the poor layout of the exhibits and the overcrowding. Friends warned us they had had a bad experience with crowds but as they'd gone on a Sunday soon after the exhibition opened we thought a Wednesday afternoon booking would be ok. Unfortunately not. Arrived there on the dot and found ourselves in a huge queue moving at snail's pace. People with headphones doing the audio tour all moved at the same pace and made everything worse. We couldn't cope--too claustrophobic and couldn't see the exhibits--so, with difficulty, pushed through to the end. The boat was wonderful but we missed out on seeing lots of things. Ridiculous layout--no sign of common sense at all. Packing in as many people as possible. A relief to get out. We sat down to have coffee and opened Private Eye to find a cartoon about the queues for the Vikings ('Thor legs') so there's obviously a lot of discussion about this but nothing at all being done to remedy the situation. An enormous pity as will put people off future exhibitions. How can they have got it so wrong?!",Far too busy - overhyped
"March 19, 2014","This exhibition was ruined for us by the crowd.  Like other visitors, we skipped the first few rooms because of the number of people crowding around the small displays.  The first three rooms were far too small relative to the number of people being allowed in every ten minutes, resulting in a bottleneck.When we got into the main room there was a bit more room to move around, but I felt that I had missed out on the build up to the Viking ship.  Whilst the scale of this was certainly impressive, I don't think this justified the high entrance fee.  Some of the other artefacts were interesting but the exhibition didn't totally hang together for me - it felt quite sparse.This is the second time in 3 months we've visited paid for exhibitions at the British Museum, only to have the experience marred by the sheer number of people allowed into the rooms at any one time.  As a result of our previous experience (on a Sunday) we deliberately took a half day off work on a Monday in the hopes it would be quieter.  If anything, it was even busier.I won't be rushing back to pay for another exhibition anytime soon.",Disappointing Viking Exhibition...
"March 18, 2014","Terribly disappointed in this exhibition! They let way too many people in, the space was too small and claustrophobic, we were unable to see any of the artefacts, our children saw even less and we were not told that there was an audio tour option. Ended up getting a refund!","Vikings - Brilliant artefacts, poor curating"
"March 18, 2014","A block buster well worth seeing - when it's finally possible to approach the exhibits. Despite timed entry there were far too many people in the space, including large groups of schoolchildren, who, though well behaved, had been provided with bits of paper and were attempting to draw the extremely complex designs of the artefacts by leaning their papers on the glass cases. Consequently both exhibits and the the text were hidden. Added to this the incomprehensible decision to position the text below the exhibits in the usual 'design led' small point, grey on grey print made it impossible to read the interpretation or explanation. And those listening to the audio guide positioned themselves in front of the stop points for an interminable time.  This is the sort of problem which should have been anticipated.Then, the next two hours were spent shuffling and squeezing through the mass of people to see the exhibits.  Now, many of these were stunning in their beauty and design, but the lack of thorough explanation and an excess of 'it is unclear' 'maybe' 'possibly' and so on, and a sparse introduction to the Viking world made the experience a bewildering one for the member of our small group who was not at all familiar with the period.The boat, of course is stunning, the size and length awe inspiring, but again, the lack of much historical context, an absence of explanation about the impact of the Vikings on this country was disappointing. For example, just one, no mention was made of St Alphage Archbishop of Canterbury, being boned to death by Viking invaders at Greenwich after they had sailed up the Thames.  This is the sort of historical detail which puts the bigger picture into context.  Neither was any explanation about the crafts of sword making, gold jewellery making or even weaving. Knowledge of these matters should not be assumed.So - high expectations and a feeling of great frustration at a wonderful opportunity missed.",The Vikings
"March 18, 2014","I am agreeing with the many negative reviews of the Viking exhibition and for the same reasons.  The crowd yesterday (a Monday, at 11:00) made it impossible to see much of anything in the first several rooms.  Given that the objects tend to be small and the explanatory placards equally small and waist high, there was really nothing to do but move on into the one good, but alas, final room.  Such a pity.",Viking Exhibition
"March 17, 2014","This exhibition was extremely disappointing. On entering the first exhibit space I was confronted by people queuing to read the captions. Although I had a timed ticket there were people from previous slots who were still stuck here because they themselves had been held up  by the previous group etc etc. I could hardly see anything and quickly passed onto the larger exhibit space where the large Viking boat was the main focus. The boat itself is extremely impressive but without it the exhibition overall wouldn't have got even a 1-star rating. Many of the exhibits are best described as 'so what?'. Who would have thought that the Vikings has stirrups for their horses, swords and shields,  or were great sea farers?I think the BM has misjudged its audience: great for school parties who are just learning about the Vikings, not very informative for anyone who has seen the far more interesting recent TV series on this era of our history.",The Vikings - too crowded
"March 17, 2014","I did not enjoy this exhibition as it was far too crowded.  As I am short, I had to wait until I could find a space in front of each exhibit.  It was difficult too, to find a description of each item.  Numbering the items and the text would help.  Museum fatigue set in very quickly.  The only one of our group that enjoyed it was over 6ft tall and could see over the heads of other people.",Viking Museum
"March 15, 2014","What a shame! This could have been so good, but the British Museum has been overtaken by greed - they pack so many people into the Viking Museum, it was a painful ordeal for all 3 of us.  We've been to a few of these 'special' exhibitions this year and last, and this one was the most overcrowded by far, making the whole thing a waste of time.  Not sure we'd want to try another one after this experience,ánd really can't recommend this, even though the actual exhibits (those we managed to see through the crowds) seemed to be good.",Vikings furious
"March 14, 2014","The Vikings exhibition at £16 per adult could have been an expensive treat but was a fiasco.  Overcrowded is an understatement.  Queuing and shuffling crocodile style to see the exhibits was the form for the visit.  After 5 minutes of not being able to see a thing, and a husband at 6ft 2 who also couldn't see anything we made the difficult decision to abandon the exhibition.  Admittedly the British Museum gave us an immeadiate refund.  But after the cost of train fares at £100 for three people and coffee, lunch etc we spent over £160 to go to London just for this exhibition.  It should be noted I work in the museum and heritage sector as a manager and I felt that this exhibition could have been organised much more efficiently to pulse visitors through the area.  To be honest it struck me that the British Museum were trying to put as many people through the space purely for financial reasons.  It left a bitter taste in my mouth and I won't be going back for a long time.",Viking Exhibition

Without the audio-guide we would have seen even less. The staff on hand did nothing to relieve the situation. And all this with timed tickets!",Fanastic Time at the British Museum
"August 5, 2008","I visited the British Museum in July 2008. I happened to go on a very rainy day in early July and the place was jammed with tourists and school children. The museum is so large that seeing everything in one day is impossible. I spent several hours and only saw a few exhibits. Best suggestion is to get a map, plan what you definately want to see and head there first. The crowds around the Rosetta stone are insane and it make take a few minutes for you to get a picture. Also, the crowds were heavist in the Egypt exhibit. The pieces shown were stunning and definately worth seeing. I tried to have lunch there, but there isn't much in the way of places to eat. There are two food counters on the main floor with some seating, that got filled up quickly. There also was a sit down restaurant, but not great for someone that wants a quick and inexpensive bite. I took one of the free guided tours of specific exhibits and went on the one for ancient Greece. The tour had around 15 people and looked at pot making and statues in Greece. It was a very informative tour, you could ask questions and was free. These tours were held all day in various halls and if you didn't want to pay for the museum highlights tour, these smaller tours are an alternative. The gift shop there was also great. If you are a history buff, there were tonnes of books on Egypt, Roman Britan, Greece etc. Overall, I had a fanastic time at the museum. It was one of the highlights of my trip.",One of a kind
"October 24, 2007","Truly a great collection of artifacts that have been taken from all over the world. The main downside is that the place is so massive - you could easily spend all day in here if you wanted to go through everything. As with many other museums, admission is free.For time management I suggest you decide what collections you want to see and check those out first. I found the Egyptian (mummies) and Greek exhibits especially amazing, but maybe just because they were larger in general. There are special exhibits that they rotate through the central area and you need to buy these tickets in advance if you want to go. Be sure to check the website if you are a big history buff or like this sort of thing.There are low cost places to eat (cafeteria style) in the central area and slightly more upscale establishments (cafe and restaurant) on the upper two levels. The cafe food was decent with reasonable prices.",INCREDIBLE

"March 11, 2020",If you are in London you must come here- it is the best Museum ever - with changing exhibitions and always great curators and topics. I just love to come here and spend hours walking around.,Sublime

"March 3, 2020","We really loved this museum. Their collection of Egyptian,  Greek and Asian artifacts is incredible.   Imagine, actually seeing the Rosetta Stone.. ",one of my favourite museums
"January 30, 2020","Just a great experience! the exhibitions are incredibly interesting. Loved the atmosphere.If you want to skip the queues, make sure you go bag free",Check out all the lions.
"January 29, 2020","Put some serious time aside to wander the collection of the British Museum. It's particularly strong on antiquities, of course. Check out all the lions.",Mind blowing 
"January 29, 2020",Went in rather unprepared and left completely mind-blown. Beautiful architecture and collection. Just walking right into the Rosetta Stone as we entered the Egyptian wing was really something. ,Boys days out at Museum
"January 29, 2020",This is a great museum and ideal day out. There are so many significant pieces of history here that will leave you spellbound.,A must see!!!
"January 27, 2020","I really enjoyed the British Museum. There are so many exhibits to see, enjoy and appreciate. Carve out several hours to fully and truly appreciate this museum.",Fascinating collections from around the world.
"January 25, 2020",recommend visiting a pre-opening highlights tour (30 pounds) or joining a tour during the day (free) . Egyptian mummies are amazing. ,Keep going back
"January 24, 2020","Every visit, no- twice every visit. The more I know these precious exhibits the more I want to see them and treat them like old friends. It is an education. The audio guide is superb.",Must see for all curious minds
"January 21, 2020","Amazing tour of the Sumerian civilization, and incredible insights into so many ancient cultures. This museum is a must see!",Wonderful Worlds 
"January 20, 2020",This museum stands on 260 years of collection history and contains centuries of objects.  Explore its many interesting displays.  Written descriptions are well done.,Mesmerizing
"January 17, 2020","If you are into archaeology and history, this is a must!!!!! Yes, some people get upset about some of the pieces being out of their country of origin, but the collection is amazing and the conservation is impeccable. If you have little time in Lo din, make sure this is one place on your list.",Must visit museum in London
"December 8, 2019",It deserves a great ‘wow’ and ‘excellent’! Go visit! It won’t disappoint you. But prepare it would take you days to review every piece of item in the museum. Suggest to spend at least few hours there if it’s your first visit!,Fabulous exhibition ‘Troy’ - shame about the facilities
"December 8, 2019","It would have been 5stars but for state of the loos. It might seem petty to complain about the state of the toilets but the British Museum is one of the top sites in London if not in the country but what impression do visitors leave with if their experience is anything like mine? BM you need to try harder in providing visitors from all over the world with basic amenities. It’s not the first time I have been to a fantastic exhibition at the BM and then wandered off down dirty and grubby unswept steps to the toilets which are frankly disgusting. Blocked up with piles of used loo paper, dripping soap dispensers, the paper towels placed underneath to catch the drips were absolutely sodden and were dripping onto the floor which was also pretty disgusting. Cubicles were left empty because they were just too horrible to use. The coffee chain in my high Street can do better! The Troy exhibition is fantastic. The way the exhibits are displayed was amazing. The way the visitor was challenged to see both the beauty of the objects and reflect on the horror of war was very effective. But my last impression, well is wasn’t great...",Plan Your Time Well
"December 8, 2019","One day is never long enough to explore the British Museum. It. From the moment you enter - a day is not enough. Speed viewing will leave you feeling you missed something. We planned a full day with breaks a various exhibitions. Enjoyed the currency exhibition and Troy currently showing. The must sees - Rosetta Stone, the mummies of course personally loved the art. Situated in a good area for restaurants and public transportation.","Impressive, very Impressive"
"December 6, 2019","Somehow over the years I hadn't managed to get to the British Museum, seems it's slightly outside the cluster.Well have made up for that now, spent hours wandering it's halls, from Korean and Chinese pottery, to meandering through the history of Egypt. There was still more to see when our legs ran out of steam...should have done 2 days.My favourite (aside from the importance of the Rosetta Stone, of course) has to be the completely pointless but completely exotic clock cum ship which meanders across the table shooting things of a quarter hour basis, you may ask why....but really it's why not.Worth a visit, educational and interesting, I'll go again one day.",Impressive
"December 5, 2019",The museum has an impressive atmosphere. Here you will find many precious exhibits worth seeing. Free entry. Usually there are many tourists. Bags and backpacks are security checked before entering. It is not allowed to make video recordings.,It’s free! 
"December 4, 2019","For a free museum, it is pretty packed with artifacts. We loved seeing the Rosetta Stone and other exhibits. One could easily spend hours looking at everything. We visited this museum a few days after going to the Louvre, and we still had a great time exploring. The only con was that many of the larger statues didn’t have heads. Other than that, it was fabulous, and best of all, FREE! ",One of the Best
"December 4, 2019","We generally hit the museums when we travel and this one is one of the best. Wonderful Egyptian, Minoan and early Greek collections. To actually see the Rosetta Stone priceless.",A unique and beautiful building
"December 3, 2019",A unique and beautiful building In itself it not only there are not only interesting exhibition and collections but it also hosts an array of fabulous events.,Free and interesting
"December 3, 2019","There's quite a lot to see and the 'main' attractions can get quite crowded- it was difficult to see the Rosetta stone, for example. It's worthwhile to get a tour so you don't miss some of the key items like the Sutton Hoo viking stuff and the Easter Island head. There was no security line when we came in the morning on a Saturday. Very good for a free museum.",One of The Best Stops in London
"November 30, 2019","No trip to London would be complete without a stop to the British Museum. We heeded the research and went after 3 pm. There were no lines to get in, the galleries were easily navigated and few exhibits had a wait— except the Mummies and The Rosetta Stone. The Museum offers its greatest hits if you only have 2-3 hours. We did our own list, matched it with the free guide and then spent a most wonderful afternoon of exploration. BRAVO to Great Britain and preservation of these amazing antiquities. We were wonderfully overwhelmed! THANKS. ",SAT visit
"November 30, 2019","since museum is free, very busy/crowded.  lots of tour groups.  saw what I wanted to see: ancient Egypt, etc.; Rosetta Stone.  worth the visit ",Great Museum
"November 28, 2019",My husband and I visited  British Museum and utdid not dissappoint. The lobby is magnificent . I love their display of Egyptian cultures.,long queues - but worth the wait
"November 28, 2019",It's a very special museum.This time I concentrated on a number of small exhibitions like the Käthe Kollwitz drawings. Excellent!,Must see!
"November 27, 2019","One of the most known and marvelous museum of the world!Very beautiful exhibitions and attractions for all the family!Must see the T-REX and the mummies!Don’t forget to see the outstanding Parthenon Marbles!Has no entrance..Must be a bit patient to get in the Museum,cause of checking the bags of the crowd before the entrance.I recommend you not going Saturday or Sunday..",Top 10
"November 26, 2019","A fabulous collection of important artefacts from around the world. I’m not getting drawn into claims of legal title, I’m appreciating the importance of these beautiful objects and what we can learn from other civilisations and approaches to make life better.Pushed for time between opening and our next activity we chose to do the top 10, we only got to number six as we were sidetracked by so many beautiful and interesting things. This really should be in the top 5 of everyone’s London tourism list.Go, enjoy and give yourself 2 hours for the top 10 or all day to really get value from the visit. Suggested donation is £5 to help it cover its costs.",Disappointed
"November 25, 2019",Was not impressed. Maybe my expectation was too high. Displays were presented in a boring manner. Could be better.,"Come on, it’s the BM!"
"November 24, 2019","Hard to not love the experience at the British Museum. So much to see. From the Rosetta Stone to marvels from all continents, this is a fantastic stop during your trip to London. You could easily spend a couple of days going through all the exhibits and levels. ",Must visit
"November 23, 2019","Visited this museum with my 13 years old son, and I want to say that this is a good museum for both adults and teenagers",Plan on Spending Whole Day
"November 23, 2019","Entered 9AM early sIgned up for Egyption Lecture.  So many quality pieces to see with world exhibits.  The Museum is huge and goes on and on.  We didn't leave until 4:30PM - exhausted but worth every minute.  It got rough duing day with so many school classes/kids.  Cafe food was very good coffee/sandwiches.  There is a fancy upstairs restaurant but it didn't open until later in day but looked very nice.  If you like museums, don't miss this one.",learned quite a bit
"November 12, 2019","went on a Friday evening, as they close late on Fridays. saw the Rosetta stone. Egyptian antiquities collection was impressive. Museum has free admissions so we made sure we purchased some things from their gift shop.",Where to start
"October 1, 2019","Well. I go there almost every time I'm in London. I have been there probably 8 or 9 times already. And I will go there few more times.It's so big. That I always say. Don't go there to see everything at once. I always just pick part out and spend more time at that part to get it all in. Then next time I pick some other part. You can run over everything, but you will then not see everything.It has so much history. It's one of the must see things when you are in London",Massive!
"September 30, 2019",Truly amazing collection of items and perfect for a rainy day! Endless galleries and certainly great for foreign tourists and locals alike,Always so inspiring!
"September 30, 2019",The British Museum is never boring and always showcases incredibly interesting historical pieces. For primary school children seeing in person all the ancient Egypt and Greece objects was like giving life to what they had only read in books and their excitement was a real treat for us adults! Recommended for all ages!,a great place to visit
"September 30, 2019","City museums are free in London, so if you have time to visit any of them, spend as much time as you can to see both art and historical exhibits.  We saw the Rosetta Stone here and a few of the exhibits. Most of the items are very old and would be appreciated by those who have studied their history.  I was very impressed with the size of this museum and all that it contains. Beautiful displays and a nice gift shop.",Crowded
"September 30, 2019","A must see.  The Elgin marbles, the Rosetta Stone and so many more priceless items!  And free!  Though, it's crazy crowded ","Awesome!  Remember, It Was The British EMPIRE!"
"September 30, 2019","Why so great?  Incredible things BECAUSE collected when it was the British Empire!  So, they had access to everything and the foresight to collect it.  The ""audio tour"" is fine, but do yourself a favor and book a private tour - you'll not regret it as this truly is a lifetime experience!!!",Remarkable
"September 30, 2019","A visit to the British Museum is a visit to the history of England.  The collection of objects gained (taken? stolen? acquired?) by the Empire is amazing.   Wherever the British went, they returned with all manner of art forms.  Whether it was Egypt, India or some other far away land, treasures were brought back and are on display in the halls of the museum.  One can spend hours or days and still not see all that there is.  Truly an impressive museum.",Absolutely amazing 
"September 28, 2019",A must museum if u love history and in London. U need to have time there in order to see and enjoy/admire history. The Egyptian and Greek sections are absolutely mesmerizing. ,If you like museums and history - Go
"September 28, 2019","Many, many years of historic art and archaeological artifacts from the golden age of exploration.  We thoroughly enjoyed seeing art from the golden ages of England.  The museum is free.",Awesome!
"September 26, 2019",Give yourself at least a whole day.  Do not rush your visit here.So many fine exhibits to see. A must for all.,Kudos to the British Museum
"September 15, 2019","Visited the British Museum, once again.  This time, the agenda was the new China and South Asia Gallery.  First stop: security.  Be sure to bring a purse or man purse (no backpack) to enter the short line to avoid long queues.  In the museum, marvel at the Grand Hall.  Wow!  Brilliant use of space and natural light.  Enter the China and South Asia Gallery.  I'm entranced by the blue, ceramic dragon.  The displays share a high standard for museums with clear signage, well-lit displays, and fascinating stories about the items on display and the history of the region.  I’m crazy about the British Museum Chinese Tang Tomb Figures with people, camels, and horses.  A highlight!","Must-see in London, though I missed the Chinese painting/calligraphy collection (not open for some reason)"
"September 14, 2019","The British Museum is on my 'bucket list', and finally I got to cross it, though I'll come again. One of the biggest and finest museums in the world, and it doesn't need recommendations.Being a linguist and a translator, I was amazed by the Rosetta Stone. A souvenir is a must takeaway.The Chinese painting/calligraphy collection was being renovated or maintained or something. But it was not open to visitors, which is a big pity. Maybe a good reason to come again next time.",Incredible Museum
"August 22, 2019","We spent the whole day here and enjoyed every minute. Highly recommend Room #1 which offers a history of the Museum and, implicitly, a history of the West’s growing knowledge of ancient history and non-Western cultures.  ","So much to see, lovely building."
"August 22, 2019",We visited on a recent trip to London. We really didn't have enough time to do the museum justice and only saw a few of the large displays. The exhibits are well set out and easily accessible even though the museum was quite crowded. The building is nice to walk through and feels spacious. We saw a lot of the Ancient Egyptian area and it was all very interesting and well documented. Would visit again if staying in or near London.,Fantastic and overwhelming museum
"August 21, 2019",Everyday is apparently a busy in the British Museum. The only fault with this great museum is that is is always crowded but you can't fault the exhibitions.,"Mummies, rsoetta stone, Pergmaine Altar."
"August 21, 2019","The mummies are a big draw and we made sure to see them. In summer things get a bit hot on the upper levels so be warned. I never realized the Rosetta Stone was in the British Museum so when I found out, of course we went to take a look. Must see!I also had never viewed the Pergamine Altar and other Greek temple statuary so that was a treat. The museum underwent a renovation not too long ago and the galleries we visited all looked brand new. Lots of great stuff here. You could spend days in the museum. Of course we were on a tight schedule and did the big stuff to say we saw it.",Family visit 
"September 13, 2019","A must see , if you go to London & have the time . It will be crowded though & possible long lines to get in . There is so much to see , the Rosetta Stone is here . We picked out our favorite things & sought them out as we were there about two hours only . You could stay for days . It is free . ",Amazing artifacts; take a special morning tour if you can
"September 11, 2019","Our family of five (two parents and three teens) splurged and purchased tickets to the Introduction to Ancient Egypt special morning tour, in an effort to to avoid the crowds. Although it's not cheap (£30/adult), we thought it was well worth it, as the tour takes place at 9;00 AM, an hour before the museum opens to the public, and our small tour group had the entire Egyptian gallery (including the Rosetta Stone) to ourselves. Our guide was very informative, although it was difficult to hear her at times, particularly when other museum employees who were walking past us were talking/laughing quite loudly. She/we did not use wireless earphone headsets. As our tour was wrapping up at 10:01 AM, the gallery immediately filled up with the other visitors and tour groups, and there was a huge crowd, 5-6 people deep, trying to take photos of the Rosetta Stone.We spent the next hour and a half, viewing the Egyptian mummies, which surprisingly wasn't too crowded (perhaps because they are located on the third floor) and the Greek galleries. We didn't realize that the Elgin Marbles referred to the collection of sculptures and other pieces of the ancient Greek Parthenon. It was amazing to see them.",Plan a whole day
"September 11, 2019","This place is huge and there is so much to see. Incredible displays of artifacts from ancient times to present day, many countries and cultures represented. Not a place you want to rush through, as we unfortunately had to. Bonus is that it is free (of course a donation is welcome, and worth it).",Could spend years here.
"September 9, 2019",You can get quite an education at this amazing place. The exhibits are thoughtful and well laid out. ,Rosetta Stone
"September 9, 2019","The Rosetta stone is one of the most important discoveries in interpreting Egyptian artifacts. It perimits translation of Greek, Dometic, and Heiroglyphs.  It was displayed in a very nice stand, and the work by Champollon was expained.",Wow
"September 9, 2019",The museum is incredible. Takes a few hours to see. It has quite an extensive collection covering pretty much all ancient civilizations. Absolutely stunning! ,Worth at least a day
"September 8, 2019","A decade after my first visit, I spent an afternoon at the British Museum and covered only about a quarter of the Museum. The Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece rooms are must-sees, but it is difficult to point out anything that is “skip-able” in here. Do take your time. And learn. Stop the silly selfies.",A must see
"September 8, 2019","The British museum is the home of the Rosetta Stone, the ancient Greek/Egyptian translation system. The museum host a wonderful collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts. A must see.",A cornucopia of treasure and enlightenment
"August 21, 2019","Amazing ! We were there for over 2 hours, and only got thru rooms 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8. We were overwhelmed by the vastness of the collection. You would need at least three visits to even roughly skim the exhibits. I advise you get a map (gratis) and tick the rooms as you go. Some of the cased exhibits are too high to view. Also orientation is most difficult as the rooms do not appear to be numbered. This makes for a challenging assignment. As you pass thru the museum you come to the realisation that without being collected, stored and exhibited much of this preserved history would have been lost.",An endlessly vast museum 
"August 21, 2019",The best part about Britain when it comes to museums is that they are free. That’s what brought me to the British museum. A very large museum with lots of collections from around the world was on display. The collection was so vast that I couldn’t finish all in one day. It’s not even practical. I met a guy from Albania who said he has a historian and had been visiting the museum for the 11th day in a row just to study the exhibits. Imagine if the museum wasn’t free!! If ever I come back to London again I would definitely visit the museum for exploring the rest of it.,great collection
"August 21, 2019","It is a very big and beautiful museum, the downhill is it is too big, I went 5 different occasions to explore it, otherwise, it is too much to take in.",One of the top museums in the world—just go!
"August 20, 2019","The British Museum is an amazing place to learn about the history of the world’s culture. They have artifacts from cultures around the world, from Easter Island (Rapa Nui) to Ancient Greece to Egypt to the Maya. Don’t miss the hall that shows what museums were like 100-150 years ago—it’s very interesting understanding the history of museums and collections.You could spend days here, and the good news is that it’s free, so you could afford to. It’s very crowded, but well worth spending a day or more.",Museum not to miss
"August 20, 2019",Wonderful museum with multiple exhibitions all worth seeing and best of all admission is FREE.  Plan on spending at least 1/2 a day to see many of the exhibits.  Don't miss the Rosetta Stone on display.,A trip through history
"August 20, 2019",I went to spend time at the British History Museum. Much to my amazement and to my surprise I found that there was a huge section of technology which included a replica of the first computer designed by Charles Babbage in the mid-1600. It was called an analytical machine and close by was a display of his brain. May be a little off putting for some but I was enthralled as I have been involved with technology most of my working life. There was also a display of Lord Byron’s daughter Lady Lovelace who is credited with developing the IF statement still used in programing. This was just something that I able to see and it did distract me from all of the other wonderful displays in this landmark in London.  Well worth a visit; be prepared to spend a few hours wandering around the exhibits.,Vacationers 
"August 29, 2019",I'm so glad we went to the British museum. I really wanted to see The Rosetta Stone and I  was delighted to find out one of the Easter Island statues was there. All in all a great experience.,Best museum of the world.
"August 27, 2019","Who said best things are not free? Thanks UK and London for making my visit memorable with this museum. It is free. We went around 5pm and was able to cover most of the artifacts. Best highlights were Rosetta stone, Renaissance arts, Greek , Egyptian mummies including Cleopatra(don't know if it is true), story of money, collection of clocks, China, Japan, India, Arabic artifacts. Don't miss this, if you are in London. Take the map (it is free, but suggested donation of 2 pounds).",My favorite in London
"August 27, 2019",I try to visit it every time I am in London. You can spend the whole day there. It has also external exhibitions of  different artists.,A must see in London
"August 26, 2019","Get there early. The lines can get crazy long. We got there to the back entrance about 30 mins early and got right in. Later they were quite long, even in the rain.Allow for several hours if you want to see everything. There's a lot in there. It's free the way we did it, but there's a paid tour where you go in before it opens. Might be worth it.",British Museum is a must visit
"August 26, 2019","This is one of the must see institutions for any visit to London. The permanent exhibits are never old no matter how many times we have been. There is so much to learn about humanity across centuries.Do try to miss holiday periods and weekends though. It is incredibly popular and the entrance queue can get pretty long. Once inside, it is still possible to get lost and away from crowds depending on the gallery or exhibit you want to see.",Get There Early and Plan to Stay for As Long as You Can!
"August 26, 2019","The first time we tried to go to the British Museum it was on a Saturday and when we arrived there were lines that spawned around the block and it was raining!  We decided that since the museum opens at 10, we’d arrive at 9 and that was a smart move since we walked right in. To our surprise the lobby was open so we were were able to get the feel of the museum even though most of the exhibition doors didn’t open until 10.  I wanted to see the Rosetta Stone and  heard that the crowds made experiencing the early Egyptian artifacts a challenge. Ironically, now that our vacation is over, I was looking at the British Museum’s website and we could have booked a tour to visit the museum before it opened. These tours cost money and if you go on your own it’s free but I regret missing this opportunity and will definitely take advantage the next time we are in London. We loved our time in the museum. Architecturally the Queen’s Court is extraordinary and that’s the “ Lobby” that you enter once you pass through security.  We loved the exhibits on Money, their Watch collection and just about every other exhibit we saw. You really could spend days just trying to learn about all the history that this vast museum encompasses.  I really loved their Mummy Collection. They have lots of cafes throughout the museum to get coffee,desserts and sandwiches. They also have extensive gift shops so you could bring home your own Rosetta Stone mouse pad, magnet or jigsaw puzzle along with hundreds of other gifts and books.",visit in the evening or before closing time to avoid the crowds: Learn something new every visit
"August 24, 2019","This was our 3rd trip to the museum since our last trip 5 years ago.  We visited around day of a heat wave in July and the museum's air conditioning could not keep up with the heat.  It was so hot the doors to the room holding the Elgin marbles were open.   We arrived around 5 pm, it was crowded, there were loads of people, just sitting on the floor camped out in the main rotunda, By the time we left near closing time, the museum had emptied of the large tour groups, the museum had cooled and it was much easier to navigate.  There is a back entrance which we used and did not have a line.The museum map has about 12 highlights marked - some of which we had not seen on previous visit, - we used this as a guide to visit the highlights some of which we had not see before (the astrolabe, the reliquary, the oxus treasure.   Also saw the room of Enlightenment which was a favorite, \ which was blessedly cool and had interesting exhibits. We went back a second day since our apartment was less than a 10 minutes walk and visiting the museum twice made it more manageable than one long visit.",Terrific museum
"August 24, 2019","Arrive early to clear security.  Be selective on what you read & view, only what really catches your eye.  Egyptian area crowded & busy, go there early.Enough to see to fill the best part of the day.Easily reached by metro & then on foot",a place to travel in time
"August 23, 2019","a place to stay long the a couple of hours , so please organise your day considering to stay in the museum even to have a bite. from Greece to Rome and from Rome to the Nile sailing with Cleopatra. just to mention something but you also can visit history from other places like Mesopotamia and Far East , let history talk to you I  strongly recommend to take your time to enjoy this jewell .children only if they want and they are interested in learning.",Crowed and a bit overwhelming - but very worth it...
"August 23, 2019","We arrived just before 10:00 am opening (free admittance) to find a long line down the street to get through security - that said it was well managed and moved quickly - took about 15 minutes. Once in it is very overwhelming and terribly amazing - so it is best to bit of homework before you go in - the most popular areas are the Egyptian displays with the mummies (it is very interesting and worth a walk-by at a minimum through the crowd) and then the Asian – Chinese areas. The Rosetta Stone is also one of the most famous artifacts in the museum – mush like the Mona Lisa there is a bit of a mob scene there. There is no way that one could see it all and in my opinion any of the areas can be fascinating and worth just spending some time at any area. You can spend as much or little time as your itinerary will allow and it will be worth it. Note that the restrooms/WC are located on the main floor and you have to go down stairs from there – there are elevators down but take a long time and there is a line for both men and women. There is great areas for sell of museum books, clothing, and many other items. There is coffee service in different areas, pizza shop etc. You really could come on many visits and would be worth the visit. Highly recommended.",very beautiful and interesting
"September 21, 2019","I LOVE THIS PLACE, all is very beautifoul, I spent a wonderful afternoon with my friends. I would like to came back here.",Elgin Marbles and so much more!
"September 20, 2019","The Elgin Marbles have been on our bucket list of things to see. They are wonderful, but we found the ceramics galleries contained treasures we had not imagined. It is a challenge to find descriptions of many of the items as they are often only laminated papers located in obscure locations. The jewels are a must see here. We enjoyed them more than the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London. It took us about 5 hours and we didn't get to everything.",Truly magnificent place
"September 19, 2019","An incredible museum for history lovers and for everyone really, a glorious testament to human history and to the British empire 'visiting' different places around the globe. A must see in London. ",Amazing museum and waffles at terrace
"September 19, 2019","British Museum is a must in London. Rosetta stone and mummies upstairs are great. Nice restaurant upstairs, but a BIG recommend to waffles from car outside museum. Mmmmm, so gooood!",Amazing 
"September 19, 2019",We loved every aspect of our visit. The treasures are beyond spectacular. We felt especially privileged to see the actual Rosetta Stone. We’re New Yorkers and have access to extraordinary museums right at home. Still - we were blown away by the extent and depth of the collections. We will definitely return!,Awaken your inner archeologist!
"September 18, 2019",This place is a draw each time we come. From the enlightenment room to the Rosetta Stone--we keep coming back. Don't miss seeing some of the most important artifacts in history!,Overwhelming Museum but Great Tour
"September 17, 2019","We did a 2-hour tour with Natasha of Universal Tour Guide.  She was a terrific guide.  She had a great personality, was friendly, answered all our questions, and tried to show us how different civilizations through time independently formed similar beliefs.  You could easily spend a week at the museum and not see it all.  The only disappointment was that a couple of the galleries we wanted to see, especially the Japan exhibit, were closed.",Wonderful Museum
"September 17, 2019","Loved this wonderful museum!   So much to see! Since my husband has difficulty walking, I wish the elevators were a little more prominately positioned.",A must-see while in London!
"September 17, 2019","The British Museum was free and was well worth the trip! Your tour begins with the infamous Rosetta Stone and it gets better from there! There are plenty of guides and an audio tour is available. There’s so much to see, we couldn’t fit it all in but you could easily spend 4-5 hours there! The restrooms are clean, there is a fantastic gift shop and the cafe offered delicious pizza and salads.",Outstanding
"September 16, 2019","This is one of the best muesum's weve ever visited. We especially enjoyed seeing the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin marbles, and the Egyptian mummies. Super impressive for the archeologist in you!",Allow for lots of time!
"August 13, 2019",Security lines are pretty long if you just show up. I recommend getting advanced tickets. By the time I got in I only had time to see the rosetta stone and the Elgin marbles. It was what I wanted to see but there was so much more it was overwhelming. For sure allow for lots of time and maybe don’t go in the summer because it was PACKED.,A fantastic visit 
"August 13, 2019","We had a rushy itinerary visiting London this time. We spent 2 hours to visit the museum, so we chosen some themes to take a look such as Europe & Asia for flipping. Very crowded with long queue! I do hope I can spend enough time to visit next time. I suggest spending one day to visit if you do like to discover history.  Then we had a good lunch @Great Court Restaurant. Please refer to my post if you want to know the restaurant~",Take the time
"August 12, 2019",It is immense. I wish we would have had more time to spend there. It is someplace that needs to be visited often. ,Manga Exhibition
"August 12, 2019","Thank you for all your support, staff today were amazing and my daughter and son had the best time. The exhibition was amazing and it really brought the history to life for my reg blind daughter and autistic .we came to London as part of a birthday celebration, the cafe and shops are very inflated prices..",So much history! 
"August 12, 2019",Loved all the different sections within the museum and was glad the entry was free!!! Went mid afternoon to avoid the crowds. ,So much to see!
"August 11, 2019","We came here twice and felt as if we barely scratched the surface of all the exhibits. Especially interesting was the store of ancient treasure (everything is a ""hoard"", it seemed!) on display from excavations around Britain. Really helped to get a sense of history here. And it doesn't hurt that it's free!",Outstanding
"August 11, 2019",The collection is great of course but in early August the place is extremely crowded. The standard highlights are obviously worth seeing but wandering into less criterion’s has a big payoff. ,Could visit this museum over and over
"August 9, 2019","We were on a British Isles cruise and the London excursion was more of a drive by of iconic places. My husband suggested we ditch the tour midway and head to the British Museum (our tour guide was great - suggested we taxi there and then taxi to the train station to catch our ship).  It had been decades since we had been to the museum, and I’m so glad we went.  The ancient Egyptian artifacts are absolutely stunning, as are the Ancient Greece items.  There was a flyer available discussing the request of Greek government that the Parthenon sculptures be returned and the museum’s position. I found it thought provoking. We also enjoyed the clock room.  I so enjoy this place and hoping I’ll be able to return someday. Definitely worth waiting in line to get in.",Mummies ... Not Moms... Real Mummies!!!
"August 9, 2019","After many years and many visits to London on business trips, I finally had a chance to be a tourist. I stayed the weekend in my home away from home City of London, and the British Museum was my first stop before visiting the Crown Jewels. The Egyptian artifacts are absolutely mind-blowing.  An absolute must see.",A childhood favourite is still relevant in adulthood
"August 7, 2019","I grew up with The British Museum. It was near where my Nan used to live and we went their a lot. I’m now several years older with a child of my own and I’m getting him to love it as much as I always have.Whatever your reason for visiting, this is the venue for you. A family visit, a solo day out, perhaps a date, the BM holds so many treasures of cultural relevance that you’ll learn every time you go. Best to see the highlights early: the Rosetta Stone, the Egyptian mummies and the like get packed after the first hour. Go check out the Lewis chessman and Sutton Hoo, smaller British artefacts which tell amazing stories about our country’s past, and the Abyssinian treasures are beautiful.If you love a gift shop, the BM has several: there’s a wide selection of books in the large book shop in the middle of the new central hall, and another dedicated to jewellery.",So much to see!!
"August 3, 2019",Great museum!!! We enjoyed seeing the museum-- even with our super bad jet lag. The Egyptian items and the chess sets were or family faves.,Too much to see in one day
"August 3, 2019",It's breathtaking how big the collection of this museum is and therefore it is quite impossible to see everything in one day. I would recommend to make a list of things you want to see in the day that you are there or to do the highlight tour which the museum also recommends.,History at its best
"August 2, 2019",I have been to many museums and this is one of the best. It has a collection of world artifactes very few can match. I have visited Egypt and the number and quality of the exhibitsare on par to those in Cairo. To see the Rosetta stone was special.You could easily spend a day exploring but a good 3-4 hours is a minimum to appreciate the wonders here if you are in a hurry.  The exhibits are well presented and organized.,Shame
"July 31, 2019","Of course you have to visit the museum, but be prepared to get very very angry. The place is a huge restaurant, with gift shops in the middle. No respect for the marvels that are there. No order, no security, they just asked us if we were carrying weapons, we said no of course, no air conditioning, people are running up and down with no plan. Do something for heavens shake",Amazing but so crowded
"July 31, 2019","The British museum is amazing with collections dated back 3000 BC. The mummies were so cool to see in person! But be aware it was SO crowded and hot! We rushed trough the museum because of this. But its free and worth it in our opinion! When we walked around the building we saw that you can actually enter at the back of museum, which had no lines!! It seemed to be for regular visitors too, so I would recommend visitors to try that entrence before the main one!",Must See
"July 30, 2019",The British Museum is a definite must see.  It has so many different items to see and experience.  Some of the exhibits are an additional cost.  We did some research before going to get a good idea of the items that we wanted to see at the museum.  Definitely doable without a guide if you like just wandering around.,Great with Kids
"July 29, 2019",I had first visited this museum as a kid myself so going back as an adult with my own children was so much fun.  My girls 12 & 10 loved it.  They especially loved all the Egyptian artifacts.  This is a great place to visit with our without kids.  And the free admission is a bonus 😉,Best part of the vacation
"July 28, 2019",We easily spent half the week working through the exhibits. The only thing I would suggest to them is more fans in the summer time in the ancient areas on the second floor.,A great museum
"July 28, 2019",The british museum is one of my favorite museums in the world. Endless exhibitions ranging from ancient Egypt to a room about modern currency. Everyone can find something they will find interesting.I visited during Edward Munch special exhibition on its last day and it was incredible.,Massive free museum
"July 27, 2019","We spent over four hours here and still missed large portions of the place.  Best to space out over a couple days if you can afford the time.  Very educational and impressive.  The museum is free.  On the day we went the line took only 5 minutes to get through.  After two and a half hours we decided to take a break and went across the street for some tea.  We then went back to the museum for another two hours.  Same quick entry and again free.The Assyrian collection, the clocks collection, and the Nereid Monument (in the Greek collection) were among the greatest highlights.  This museum is a must if you have more than a day or two in London.  The gift shop here is enormous.  You'll want to set aside some extra time for the shop if you're looking for a gift for anyone.  Impressive amount of cool history books for kids and adults.",A fab museum
"July 26, 2019","So much to see, needs more than one visit. Beware it gets incredibly busy so looking at the exhibits can be tricky, especially the more famous ones and especially for children. So go early or at the end of the day.The Egyptian rooms are obvious favourites! Such things to see.",Rosetta Stone and the mummies
"July 25, 2019",Great place for children.  We decided to limit our visit to delve deeper into what we saw instead of broad shallow gaze at what the great museum can offer.  This gave us the real example to touch upon a part of history with the Rosetta Stone.  The mummies were completely different from what we have in Louvre.  It gave the children different feel of the mummies and how it looked like.  The preserved mummies gave us another topic to touch upon.,Vast Collection and beautiful architecture
"July 24, 2019","We went in July during 25 degree weather. Inside the museum, only those rooms with fabric or paper are air-conditioned. Can’t imagine how some of those workers coped with the stifling heat. It was 28-30 inside. The collection itself is impressive, especially the mummies, the Egyptian artifacts, and the Greek rooms of the remnants from the Temple of Apollo. My son was especially impressed with the Manga exhibit. Be sure to check where the bathrooms are, because the ones beside the central bookshop are always crowded. I walked over to another one and it was empty. The workers there are very kind and helpful, especially the gentleman in the jewelry shop who wrapped our treasures well and gave us recommendations for further explorations in the city.",Great Museum
"July 24, 2019","So much to see. Especially loved the mummies. The museum is bright, exhibitions are wonderful. There are guided visits who h we did not do.",Don't go on a hot day in summer!
"July 23, 2019","Sadly our visit was marred by the heat and lack of air in the building.  No attempt to help visitors - not a fan in sight anywhere!!  Food for sale was out in the heat, including things with chicken in and cream .  Cakes, etc all out with no covers on so could be coughed and sneezed on by people waiting to be served. Then nowhere to sit down.  It's quite frustrating to have so many attempts to sell you food without providing sufficient places to sit and consume them.  Many people ended up sitting on the stairs, which made getting past tricky at times.  Not enough ladies loos so queues there too. One I visited had the only two hand dryers out of order and no paper towels. Also I saw a visitor try both sanitary products machines and neither worked. I felt totally ashamed at the service we were offering foreign visitors.  More attention needs to be given to the visitors experience.Lastly, although it says bags will be searched, with is fair enough for safety, it would help if they also told you that some items will be confiscated.  I was not allowed to take in a small pair of scissors used for crochet.  I got them back at the end of the visit but it meant going back across the museum to get them.  Such a shame as what little we were able to see was good. We won't be returning though.",Very educational!
"July 22, 2019","This is a fantastic opportunity to see the Rosetta Stone and many famous sculptures and artifacts. Bring the kids! Oh and bring your sketch pad! Great gift shop if you aren't an artist and want to bring home a piece. plus, they have a special library. ",Not in the summer 
"July 22, 2019",Too warm and too crowded on a summer day. If we go again it will be out of season. Not worth the long wait.,Kind of wish I lived here
"July 22, 2019",Cannot visit London without visiting the Museum. With exhibits from around the world and across the centuries it has near enough everything you could want to see. Went for the special Manga Exhibit and loved every second of it.,The British Museum
"July 22, 2019","A great place to learn about the Ancient World in London.  Learn all about Ancient Egypt and how we used the Rosetta Stone to crack the Egyptian hieroglyphs.  Clean, informative, light, fun.  Not a stuffy museum.",Museum Highlights Tour - very worthwhile
"July 21, 2019","Our family (inc 2 teenagers) visited and had rebooked the 90 minute highlight tour, through the British Museum site. This is definitely the tour to do during peak times as it gets you through the crowds and you get see the 'highlights'. You of course then are able to see more after the tour, but at least then you have your bearings and can work your way around the museum and what it has on offer. For teens (ours anyway), 90 minutes of highlights covers the main bits !Most crowded area was the Egyptian Mummy area.. Try and book a morning tour.",Amazing Collection
"June 4, 2019","We went on a Friday and the line outdoors was probably 300 people long. One of the guards noticed my cane and opened a pathway directly to the door or outdoor lift which we used. Loved the Egyptian Rooms and the timepieces, many dating back to the 1500s to 1800's. Elevators available and benches scattered for those who need a respite. We tried the cafe; had a very nice pizza and lemoncello flavored poundcake. A delightful day.","Saw the China Exhibition, missed the Manga"
"June 3, 2019","There are always new exhibitions on show, I went there recently to catch the Manga exhibition, however due to poor planning on our side, it was sold out. Learning, if you really want to see something book in advance!",For anyone interested in Egyptology this is not to be missed
"June 3, 2019","A very extensive collection of Egyptian tomb relics as well as items from  neighboring areas.  Could have literally spent days there, so much to see and take in.  Best part is admission is free.  ","An All-Encompassing, Overwhelmingly Jam-Packed Review of Human Civilization"
"June 1, 2019","We're a curious pair, my wife and I, and we revel in learning new segments of knowledge that make human civilization for comprehensible and the British Museum accomplishes that more than any other we've visited, with the possible exception of the Met in NYC.   When the British Empire ruled most of the world, their soldiers and explorers surveyed the remnants of prior empires and brought back to England the choicest samples of what was accomplished long ago.   We learn about ancient Egyptian culture through the Rosetta Stone; Greek gods and art through the Elgin Marbles;  the glories of ancient Assyria, Babylonia, Persia and others through artifacts and relics saved from oblivion by intrepid Englishmen in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.   To really delve into the contents of the British Museum, be prepared to spend many hours and to devote much of your brain capacity to the extraordinary treasure trove of materials on display. ",Lots to see from all over the world
"May 31, 2019",Great selection of stuff from all over the world.  Need to have a plan before entering or you will get overwelmed by all the differnt things to see.,So much to see
"May 31, 2019","World famous collection of artefacts from different civilsations. Can get very crowded. Search alternative loos e.g. in the basement as the queues can be long. Not particularly child friendly unless the child is happy to look but not touch. Great shop for history gifts. Exhibitions are generally wonderful but go early to avoid crowds. Allow time to go through security check at the entrance. There can be a long queue. Cafe in main hall, pizza cage near main entrance.",Wonderful place
"May 31, 2019",I love the Buildings and each exhibition part. Was going 16 km inside the museum. The pizza in the reastaurant is very good.,Vast collection of ancient art and artifacts.
"May 30, 2019",The museum hosts a vast collection of ancient art and artifacts.  We spent most of our time in the anciect Egyptian section.  We especially enjoyed the mummies and elaborately painted sarcophagi.,A must-see for everyonw
"May 30, 2019","The British Museum is a true international treasure. This amazing collection of historic and historical artifacts is second to none. The Greek and Roman collections alone could consume a full day. In addition to the main collections, the Museum regularly has additional collections available to visitors for an extra fee. Depending on your interests, this may be worth investigating before your visit. In fact, visitors should do their homework before going to ensure they see their areas of interest first. Not surprisingly, the crowds are constant at the Museum, so make sure you know where you want to go in advance. It’s also possible to buy tickets in advance, which is a good idea. ",So much to see!
"May 29, 2019","This was my 2nd favorite stop (1st being the Tower of London). Best bang for your buck, since it's free! They ask for a small donation, and I would suggest doing so. The museum is out of this world. The sheer size of the collection is astounding dating from the earliest humans to current art. I dreamed of being Indiana Jones as a kid, so seeing the Egyptian and Greek/Roman collection was by far my favorite. There is so much to see - make sure you carve out enough time or break it down into a couple of days.",Troy Exhibition
"February 23, 2020",We were disappointed with this exhibition. The information notices were difficult to read. They were placed low which meant that the light was obscured when people leaned in to look at the item exhibited. We are members but we bought tickets for friends. We felt the ticket price very high for the number of artifacts on view.,A very quick visit 
"February 23, 2020","It was a very quick visit, but this place is an inspiration as well as being an institution. To see the Roman, Greek & Egyptian artifacts are amazing. The rosetta stone is a very important piece of rock! It's pure history. ","Amazing Place, FREE and Friendly!"
"February 23, 2020","It's a long while since our last visit and decided to take our two nieces for a wander round. There was a long queue, as it was school holidays and a Saturday, but one of the staff noted my eldest niece is pregnant and allowed us straight through - that was really appreciated as she would have struggled to queue that long.A day is not enough to see everything, but you can get a flavour and see amazing artifacts from all corners of the globe - including the Rosetta Stone.Just have a visit and let the history soak in.",An amazing collection for free!
"February 23, 2020",Get there early at the weekend because it gets busy fast. It is well laid out and plenty of amazing artefacts in addition to the famous Egyptian ones. ,"Huge, long lines for security check and 2 pounds for a map"
"February 23, 2020","It takes about 10 minutes in line to get checked, and it’s always crowded. It’s annoying to have to pay 2 pounds for a map. Clearly it has amazing exhibitions but download a map prior and focus on a few exhibits to get the most as it could take days.",So amazing
"February 23, 2020",This is a wonderfull place with masters paints. I go there t wice a year and i'm never bored. It's always an amazing  moment .,Simply amazing!
"February 23, 2020","History, art and civilization, perfect organisation altogether!I will visit it again when I go to London again, one day of visiting is not enough!",A must
"February 23, 2020",A morning with lunch. Great Egyptian exhibition. Seating for the cafe could be extended as people were sitting on floor to eat. Not really well equipped for half term.,Excellent
"February 23, 2020",I often revisit and always make for the Assyrian Rooms. The wall panels are interesting if you spend time examining them. Lots of detail. And the shop has many books and other things to buy. But you cannot do the whole museum in one go. It is too big. Another part that is of interest is the Clock collection. I really do recommend that you visit this part of the collections.,It was a great museum 
"February 23, 2020","I visited firs time . A lot of art there. So huge . Entrance is free . Clean , tidy . There were beautiful historical items there. I think it is a biggest and rich museum in the word.",Wonderful Museum
"June 10, 2019",This is a wonderful museum to visit and holds many of the world's treasures. Be prepared to be mobbed as the crowds are quite heavy. The price is well worth it...free. :),Waited a lifetime
"June 10, 2019","This was a bucket list trip for me. Blocked out the entire day to spend here, and I did.You can seriously get lost in this place, even with a map. ",Magnificent
"June 9, 2019",The British museum remains one of my favourite museums and I have been world wide. Try to go to a lunchtime gallery talk which are free and fascinating to broaden your knowledge to areas maybe you haven’t looked into. The security is vital so I’m afraid you have to put up with it and most museums abroad charge hefty ticket prices so I think they should be applauded. They have children’s activities at weekends and holidays too!,Lots of artifacts
"June 9, 2019",Was not on our original plans but as it was free we decided to check it out as not much else in London is free.  Well worth the visit as there is a lot to see and you could spend a lot of time there if you wanted to.,Plan extra time!
"June 9, 2019","If you love museums, culture and history, ignore all the “suggested time to spend” recommendations for this museum. They are much, much too short. We spent 4.5 hours here, and only had time for 1 gallery, 1 short, free tour, and a quick lunch in the museum. That being said, we didn’t have any children/teens with us...The only negative thing I have to say is that the tour groups were somewhat overwhelming. There were a lot of them, and they were large, making it sometimes difficult to view items, or finish viewing items. The museum docent-led tour we did was informative (and free). The tour times are posted in several locations, and there are several different ones. We also enjoyed the audio guide, which is available from the information area for a small fee.",Budget for a day if you want to see it all!
"June 7, 2019","We went back specifically to see all the Egyptian rooms, and they were as impressive as I remembered.  I especially appreciated that they added several documents proving providence of the works.  The collection is stunning.",One of my favorites
"June 5, 2019",You can't go wrong with a free visit to the British Museum. Even if you on skim the surface and stay for an hour. Check out the Rosetta Stone and the Lewis Chessmen and some of the other highlights or spend a few hours and see a lot more.  ,All world in the one place
"June 5, 2019",You can find here the whole collection of the most precious things from around the world. Such an important place to visit. The architecture is also wonderful.,So much history in one place!
"June 5, 2019","Don’t miss this museum if you’re in London. I loved how much you can learn about the world in such a short window. If you have limited time, it’s worth downloading an audio tour (like Rick Steves) to see the highlights efficiently. ",Best antiquities museum
"June 4, 2019","If you’ve been all over Europe and seen enough art, this is the museum for you.I could spend a lifetime just looking at the Egyptian artifacts.  Mummies and sarcophaguses were a site to be seen.  I can’t wait to go back - and by the way, it’s free.  How can you beat free!! ",British ??
"May 16, 2019","Sorry, to me it was a collection of ""prizes"" the British empire plundered whilst on a series of jollies, quality material, rather, in my opinion, placed thro-out the museum with no real start/end, much more enjoyable at the Imperial War museum, every-body to their own!!",Yet another great one.....
"May 16, 2019",British museum is another great place in London to spend an afternoon.  Elgin Marbles a MUST SEE.  But so is everything else.One of the BEST gift shops around.,London 
"May 16, 2019",All museums are free in London. The British Museum is very good. Beware they set you up for a donation as part of the entry process s d there are donation boxes everywhere throughout the museum. We made a donation on our way out once we had an appreciation of it. We also go sucked into buying a map between the entry doors and the information area inside. There are free maps inside! The Egyptian section was my favorite. I’m biased as we were in Egypt last year. Allow a few hours for this one.,Worth the wait
"May 15, 2019","Big lines on the weekends. Don't carry a bag and you will pass thru quickly. The different areas are amazing and the centre glass roof is awesome . Greek, Roman, Mummys are all on display. . Grab a map.",A must see in London
"May 14, 2019","I took the audio tour, the one that had 20 stops around the museum. For 6 pounds I got a great exposure to most of the exhibits in about 3 hours.  I loved this museum but I highly recommend a guided or audio tour otherwise it may be overwhelming. I plan to go back with my son when he is a little older.",Amazing 
"May 13, 2019","There is so much to see, you can easily spend a whole day there. There is also a couple of cafes inside to keep you going. ","Impressive, endless, very interesting."
"May 13, 2019","One of the most spectacular museums in the world! They have a complete collection of all cultures, but what impressed me most were those of Egypt, Greece, Mesopotamia.",Munch exhibition
"May 12, 2019","I went purely to go to Edvard Munch special exhibition this time (travelled 200 mi). Excellent collection, thoughtfully presented (I’m not arty one by the way). The space was well planned, pleasant place to be & informative, interesting display. I thought whoever planned it had a lot of thoughts into it & made a fantastic job of it. I recommend booking tickets online in advance. I’d seen a lot of tourists just passing by & wanted to get in, only to be turned away at the door as the tickets for the day had sold out already.While you’re there, the new(-ish) Japanese gallery on the top floor is worth a visit. The last time (summer 2018) we were there, it was closed, so visited for the 1st time. I was impressed they had “Haniwa” & other items rarely seen nor known outside Japan.",Amazing place!
"May 12, 2019","If your intention is to see the whole museum, you may need a week.  I particularly enjoyed the Egyptian galleries.  Many great pieces to see from all over the world.  We used the hopper bus to travel there.",Great antiquities! Schedule time for this museum.
"May 12, 2019","We have centered several trips to London around a visit to the museum. The Brits have acquired some of the world's most prestigious ancient artifacts from Egypt, Greece, and Rome.The centerpiece of the museum, the Rosetta Stone, is a must-see!  ",A must in London for history lovers
"May 21, 2019","We visited these rooms with a couple of friends and in spite of our time limitations spent there more than an hour.The exhibition is well organized, you learn a lot, you get a feeling of what people having lived there experienced.In short worth visiting, particularly for history lovers.",Exceptional
"May 5, 2019",Wonderful museum. One of my favorites. I wish I had more time to see everything but I was glad it was open late on friday. Make the time to visit. ,Very massive and interesting museum
"May 4, 2019","It's a massive museum! They have huge collections of the Roman's, Egyptians, history of money, clocks, etc! What interested me most is the mummy collections! This is recommended for all ages! ",amazing collection of the world's historic artefacts
"May 3, 2019","Huge museum with unique pieces from history. Personal highlights were the Rosetta Stone and The Elgin Marbles. Expect crowds and give yourself time to get from room to room. Free admission, donation recommended.",Just as fascinating no matter how many times I go
"May 3, 2019","I visit the British Museum every time I am in London.  The building, the collection, the atmosphere - all are awe inspiring.  The Egyptian collection can be seen over and over again.  It is large enough that you never feel squashed by crowds and you can wander off and find quiet corners.  On top of all this admission is free.",Very interesting
"May 3, 2019",Has some very old stuff in there!!!Really worth a visit.Allow at least 2 - 3 hours to have a good look around.,Worth the time spent
"May 2, 2019","This is a wonderful place just full of exhibits and information and it is free!   In order to do this right you need to plan in several hours so you can enjoy the artifacts and information, not to mention this is a beautiful building!  It would be a wonderful way to spend a rainy afternoon!  Worth the time invested.",Best museum 
"May 2, 2019",I'm highly rated this museum over Louvre as you can learn more things from the museum. In Louvre ypu couldn't find any details in English but in British museum they took maximum effort to ellustrate historical details. Don't forget to see the Thara devi sculpture from Sri Lanka. ,7 hours well spent
"May 2, 2019","The best collection of artefacts from Britain and around the globe in one central location. Many people have noted how these were acquired over the centuries, however, the expert care and attention to preservation is something that I appreciate.I recommend getting there early, it’s busy. Wear layers of clothes; some galleries are hot. Also, bring water. Food places throughout had small but well made food and cakes for pit stops. ",Huge musuem
"April 24, 2019","Second time there and we found new stuff to see. The museum is huge and covers many centuries, a real must if you like history.",Wow
"April 23, 2019",I spend two days combing the treasures of this marvelous place. At the time there was an Edvard Munch exhibition on. Easy to lose days here. Just loved it.,Amazing
"May 20, 2019",Don't miss this museum.  Have a plan or make one when you get there as there is too much to absorb in one visit without it.  The Museum has handy maps/booklets which help.,Inspiring. 
"May 19, 2019","Big and beautiful. Full of wonders from around the world. They really do push the ""donation"" on entry but it is voluntary. Drinks are expensive and few for a hot day in a near all glass central building but with so many floors of fine exhibits its worth it. Real mummies. Egyptian statues, fine art. Guided tours throughout. ",Pleasant visit!
"May 18, 2019","The collection is huge and really well organized. Using the free map you can move around pretty easily. Moreover, the shops are lovely!",Everything I expected
"May 18, 2019","We came for the Egyptian display.  We stayed for the Greek, Roman, Iran, Viking, etc collections.  Once we started wandering, we just kept going. There’s so much to see and read.  All displays had descriptions along with dates.  It was fascinating.",Worth a visit
"May 17, 2019",This is a place you could easily spend a whole day in if you wanted. So many interesting and informative displays. It gets extremely busy so good to get in early. ,Glad we visited during our short visit to London from Australia
"May 17, 2019",With only a short time in London we had to prioritise what to visit and we are so glad we chose the British Museum. It was extremely busy however we loved seeing extremely famous exhibits such as the Rosetta Stone however equally as interesting seeing lesser known artefacts such as the game of Ur. We finished our time at the museum with high tea which was splendid.,Must-go

"May 17, 2019","There is something to see for everyone at the British Museum. You could spend the week in this amazing museum but if you do not have much time let your children guide you and make some new discoveries, it more fun for them!",Unbelievable space
"May 16, 2019",Enormous light filled atrium welcomes the visitors.  A huge variety of exhibitions and displays.  Well laid out. Could spend several days here.,Vast collection of ancient art and artifacts.

"May 30, 2019","The British Museum is a true international treasure. This amazing collection of historic and historical artifacts is second to none. The Greek and Roman collections alone could consume a full day. In addition to the main collections, the Museum regularly has additional collections available to visitors for an extra fee. Depending on your interests, this may be worth investigating before your visit. In fact, visitors should do their homework before going to ensure they see their areas of interest first. Not surprisingly, the crowds are constant at the Museum, so make sure you know where you want to go in advance. It’s also possible to buy tickets in advance, which is a good idea. ",So much to see!
"May 29, 2019","This was my 2nd favorite stop (1st being the Tower of London). Best bang for your buck, since it's free! They ask for a small donation, and I would suggest doing so. The museum is out of this world. The sheer size of the collection is astounding dating from the earliest humans to current art. I dreamed of being Indiana Jones as a kid, so seeing the Egyptian and Greek/Roman collection was by far my favorite. There is so much to see - make sure you carve out enough time or break it down into a couple of days.",Embarrassed
"May 29, 2019",Museums used to be a calm place of reflection and education - this has turned into a concrete monstrosity with begging bowls at every turn and doorway - from being directed at the entrance to a donation line to every twist and turn of the building it screams gimme gimee - what happened to a cultural experience - embarrassed to be British!!,Too much to see
"May 28, 2019",It's crazy how many items the museum has. A flight of stairs is its own attraction. The audio tour is worth it (£7). The gift shop is fantastic. Just do it.,The British Museum is much more than that.
"May 28, 2019","The British Museum is a fabulous place to visit and it is free to enter. The museum has a staggering amount of artifacts to see and one day just isn't enough time to get round, but if that is all you have, don't be put off by that, choose the things you most want to see and do that. Eating and drinking on any tourist site in London will cost the earth, so if you are happy to pay the over the top prices all well and good, if not make other arrangements.I can not recommend this museum enough, if you haven't been, you must.",Large and munch
"May 27, 2019","Came here more for the edvard munch exhibit admittedly. The musem itself is beautiful and the great hall designed by norman foster in 2000. The 8 million artefacts here dwarve the lourve’s 300,000. Sadly a section was donated by the opiod sackler family",Amazing Museum!! 
"May 26, 2019",If you love world history and artifacts then this is the museum for you. I must admit I didn’t know much about this museum however it was recommended by a friend so I figured I’d try it out. I’m so glad I did! There are 70 different galleries and exhibits to see from all over the world. You literally need a day or two to see it all. I found myself amazed by everything I saw. If you’re short for time they have a suggested guide/map that tells you what exhibits you should see and where they’re located. Oh did I mention that it’s FREE?! If you’re in London it’s a must see! ,Well presented but exhausting
"May 26, 2019","The British Museum is great, but it's even too great - trying to see even the shortlisted rooms is impossible during one visit. When going, be prepared for the safety inspection at the door!",Awe-inspiring
"May 25, 2019","The British Museum is amazing. There is so much to see and do you either have to devote a full day or plan your route accordingly - due to a time constraint we only were able to spend a couple of hours and devoted it to a few areas. We started with the Egyptian areas as we knew there would be a lot, and boy it did not disappoint. It is sad to realize most of this stuff was “looted” back in the day. But we loved viewing it all and reading the history. Our next area was Ancient Greece and it too did not disappoint. Due to time we did not look at more modern Europe or other areas. Overall well worth the visit.",7 hours well spent
"May 2, 2019","The best collection of artefacts from Britain and around the globe in one central location. Many people have noted how these were acquired over the centuries, however, the expert care and attention to preservation is something that I appreciate.I recommend getting there early, it’s busy. Wear layers of clothes; some galleries are hot. Also, bring water. Food places throughout had small but well made food and cakes for pit stops. ",Huge musuem

"April 21, 2019","Honestly, I’m not a fan of too many museums even though I’ve been to more than 50 of them. However, I absolutely love this one and I tell everyone to go if in London.  It’s large, free and easy to navigate with such interesting artifacts. I would highly recommend it!",A must when visiting London

"April 20, 2019","These buildings are stunning outside and in. Although it was a hot bank holiday when we decided to go, the que’s looked long so we almost turned around and left but actually only lasted around 15 minutes.As it was so busy inside we literally only saw 2 sections (Egyptian and European) before deciding that we had enough and decided to escape the boards of people walking in different directions.","Lots of exciting exhibits, extremely well presented."

"April 7, 2019","Simply amazing place.  The collection of antiquities is mind blowing, especially when the cost of the museum if free.  The Egyptian collection of mummies are incredible, but to stand in front of the Rosetta Stone absolutely is a breathtaking experience.  The museum is very crowded, even early in the morning and there are lots of school children, but Hubby and I were not in a hurry, so we were able to take our time and see everything we wanted to see.  A definite stop while in London.",Why is this such a secret

"March 31, 2019",This beautiful building contains a mind boggling amount of displays from all over the world and its free to visit. Its must see attraction.,Plan on spending time here
"March 31, 2019","We did not allow even close to enough time to visit the British Museum. It is quite impressive and large.  From the Rosetta Stone to countless ancient artifacts, their collection is amazing.  I believe they only present 1% of their collection at a time which is a little disappointing because they have so much room,  but it was still overwhelming.  Most impressive is that it is free to enter and even though we went on a Saturday afternoon the crowds were tolerable.  I only wish we had given ourselves more time as 2.5 hours is not enough.  Disclaimer - We are big history buffs (especially Ancient Greek) so if historical things aren't your cup of tea this might not be the place for you.  ",Well organized and infomrative
"March 26, 2019","We did a whirlwind tour of the museum using the Rick Steve's audioguide to Europe app and it was very informative and best of all, free. The museum is lovely and well organized. The biggest draw is no doubt the Rosetta Stone. We went in the afternoon and there were a lot of people but we got to see everything we wanted to see. Make sure you budget time before entering to have your bags searched for sharp objects. I think in high season the line can be quite long.",Fantastic and huge place
"March 26, 2019","The best museum I've ever been! Place is huge, and take 2-3 hours to see all these fantastic stuff. If you want to avoid crowd, I recommend to be there early in the morning. Also, buy a map for easy navigation.",Extremely big

"March 8, 2019","If you love antiquities, you will love this museum!  It is jam packed with all sorts of interesting finds and information.  I really enjoyed the Egyptian section the most.  This museum is huge and overwhelming - we were here for 3 hours and didn't see everything!  I wish we had more time, and had been able to come back another day (since entry is free!).  Take advantage of the late closing time on Friday nights!",An Excellent Visit
"March 8, 2019","My family and I went for a short trip to London this winter vacation.We arrived there in the morning.It was really cold there.So remember to bring enough clothes.After we arrived there,we went to the British Museum.We saw many historical relics.Those relics are from many countries in the world.There are the mummy that come from Egypt,to the Diamond Sutra that come from China.I learned a lot of things about history.It was an excellent trip.",Fantastic day at the museum
"March 5, 2019","We have tried to visit the British museum today and say tried because this place cannot be covered even in a week!!! Such incredible expos, particularly impressed by the mummies and the Assiryan collections. But really, each collection is rich with so many impressive items and everything is so well presented!! Our day was long and tiring , but, oh, what an incredible experience!!! A total MUST during your stay in London!!",Always a new experience
"March 4, 2019","I go here every time in London, and it's always a new experience. Go when it first opens and hit the Rosetta Stone and mummies before the school groups get there.The museum is massive, so you could easily spend a full day or more checking out the plunder of the British Empire, plus actual British artifacts. This last time, we just spent a couple hours, tops, because most of our group had been there before and because we were traveling with a toddler. Short trips are doable if you know where you want to go or are willing to just wander through a random room or too. With free admission, you don't feel guilty about popping in and out either.In terms of traveling with small children, it's admittedly better for slightly older kids (as the many school groups demonstrate). There are rarely hands-on activities, so it can be a bit of a slog unless you're good at engaging kids' attention to make the history come alive (which can be kind of exhausting when you want to look with grown-up eyes). My son got worn out pretty quickly, but he lasted longer than he might have otherwise because we prepped him with the book Ottoline at the British Museum. I think it's out of print now, but you can get copies online. It's a cute book about a cat at the museum from back in the days when they used to feed all the strays. The cat encounters lots of real-life artifacts that the museum still displays, and my son liked tracking all these things down. In other words, you can certainly bring small kids here, but you have to do a bit more ""work"" than, say, at the Natural History Museum.",Recommend the escorted pre-opening tours 
"March 4, 2019",Certainly worth the £30  and a great introduction to the Museum.  Book them on-line a do as many as you can.,You can revisit History here
"February 26, 2019","A wonderful place to refresh your knowledge of Britain and some of their old colonies. One must take a professional guide, who are capable of giving all the details.

"February 21, 2019",No line at the back entrance. We walked straight in while the line at the front of the museum went around the block. Also go early or late afternoon. ,It's a must.
"February 20, 2019",The British Museum is well worth a visit.There are civilizations from all over the world one needs more than one day to visit all the floors and explore the different cultures.My favourite wing of the museum is the Greek one.The parthenon Marbles are exhibited there since the have been removed from the Parthenon in Athens.The entrance is free if one wants they can donate a few pounds and it is open on sundays.I feld dissapointed because i realzed that all the exhibits were taken from various cultures however one must not miss the opportunity to visit this museum.,"Stunning atrium, stunning discoveries"
"February 17, 2019",You cannot leave The British Museum without having seen the atrium. I just love it whenever the design of the building which houses priceless objects is a work of art in and of itself. There are no words for the mummies and objects that have been curated here. I was amazed to see the state of human hair which must have been at least from 1300 BC! How can this be? ,A museum you must visit
"February 17, 2019",It’s one of places must see in London as there are really very interesting exhibits to see from all over the world. I must say that is a global Museum. Don’t forger to visit the Greek and Egypt departments.,Yes!! but it feels ..old
"February 13, 2019","It is my second visit at the British Museum. The first time in 2012 I was so excited, mainly because of the exhibits. I am still excited about them BUT  i really felt that nothing has improved over the years. The exhibition rooms have a really old feeling and the way the exhibits are scattered in place is the one of the previous century... I hope that in near future this will change so that the greatness of the collection would emerge. A big plus if the free ticket.Honestly this comment is written with love.",Worth to see
"February 12, 2019",Worth to see however sometimes confusing. Not all the paths market clearly and can end up going in circles. I have most enjoyed greek and Egyptian displays.  ,Be careful not to get caught by the donation con
"February 10, 2019","I have been a regular visitor to the British Museum and most years have made donations to it during my visits. However, this at the start of this visit I found a new security procedure in place. As I finished having my bag checked I was directed by an official to go to desk number two. I presumed this was something to do with the security check. It was not. It was a 'voluntary donation' desk, where the voluntary nature of the donation was not at all clear. It was quite clear that some of the non-native visitors thought this was some form of entrance fee they had to pay. In the past, I have made donations to the British Museum and have also supported a number of organisations I am involved with in making donations. As from now I am stopping all my donations and will encourage the bodies I am connected with to do the same until the donation desks are removed from the security area.",A special visit for my dad's 70th to one of the greatest world museums
"December 28, 2018","I think this is one of the greatest museums in the world, for four reasons:- the quality of the collections- the architecture of the building itself- the amazing free tours- the fact that entry is free!You could easily spend days in here- or, like I have, discover it over many years. When I first moved to London more than ten years ago and I didn't have much spare cash, one of my favourite treats was to go to this museum and access culture as if I was a king. The best thing I used to do was to go on the free tours, staffed by volunteers- I must have been on about 10 different ones. Every one was fantastic and sometimes there were few other visitors on the tour- I think once there were just three of us. The volunteers are real specialists in their subjects- for example the Egypt specialist could read hieroglyphics- and their passion helps to bring the exhibits alive in a way I can seldom experience just from wandering around on my own.For my Dad's 70th birthday I was taking him on a trip and we were passing through London, so my wife and I brought him here. He loves learning about history so I knew he would enjoy it. We easily got onto a tour (you just turn up at a meeting point in the relevant gallery, you don't need to book) and had a fantastic time.We are so lucky to have this amazing place in our country.",Well Worth a Visit
"December 27, 2018",Absolutely brilliant place to visit with many interesting exhibits to see I would highly recommend.  To see such pivotal Items as the Rosetta stone really made my day I could easily have spent several days looking around instead of the few hours I actually had.,A Trip Through History
"December 21, 2018","The British Museum has so much to see, you have to make choices.  I would advise getting to the museum when it opens and plan on spending as much time as you feel necessary to see all the exhibits you want to see.  The museum visitor's guide is very helpful.  Visiting the British Museum is a trip through history and a ""must see"" when you visit London.",Please give me more!!! 
"December 12, 2018","A difficult place to describe in one post. An eclectic mix of the recent millenia of human history, this museum houses artifacts of almost every civilisation conceivable ('acquired' through various means one might add). It can be quite overwhelming initially and so a guided tour on specific civilisations or on a specific theme is a must. It ties everything together well with a cohesive story that one can follow instead of just roaming by oneself (which in itself is enjoyable depending on your personality). Hours or days can go by but it is exhilarating to learn about where we've been so that we may know where we're going. ",Always something interesting to see
"December 11, 2018","Loved the way the 'I am Ashurbanipal' exhibition brought the reliefs to life, explaining the story they represented.There was a massive queue at the front of the building so we went to the entrance on Montague Place and got in immediately.",Best of the best.  Best!!

"December 10, 2018","Perhaps one of the world's most complete mounds. The British Museum is one of the largest and probably the most beautiful museums in the world. If one visits it, he can see exhibits from all over the world, from various peoples such as ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Japanese, Chinese, Sumerians, Europeans, Indians, Africans etc.As in most English museums, access is free, and it is worthwhile to visit someone to see past work.Most important of the exhibits are the parts of Parthenon, Karyatida and other ancient Greek statues.",Best museum I  have been to
"December 6, 2018","I thought the Mets in New York was good but the British Museum is still the best. I love the Egyptian, Alsyrian, Greek and Roman section.

"January 23, 2019",My technology oriented children weren’t enthusiastic about visiting the British Museum and I knew we’d need help to appreciate the riches of the museum properly. Dan was fun and got the children to absorb so much more. I’m not sure they are history enthusiasts yet but I feel like their history classes at school will have more meaning for them now. Thanks Dan!,Amazing museum
"January 21, 2019",The British museum was great way to start my trip to London. What an amazing collection! The audio guide was a real treat as well. Get there as early as possible!

"January 15, 2019","OK, so the sun never set on the British Empire, and it's like they took every single cool thing from everywhere they ruled and brought it back here, in one place, for you to see.  Is it wrong?  Yeah, probably.  Greece would really like half the parthenon back.  On the other hand, when you're walking through the recreated Syrian palace and looking at the hand carved walls that have been safely preserved for posterity, you might think, ""Hey, this is pretty cool that I don't have to worry about ISIS jumping me into their gang right now and I can just see this stuff.""  So go...see the Rosetta Stone, the Parthenon, gigantic coins and an Easter Island statue all together in one crazy visit!","Excellent Museum, a must visit in London"

"December 2, 2018","The penalty that British Museum visitors pay for this museum being free is that it is always full. Even when you have to pay, it's sometimes full too. It is well worth putting up with the crowds to experience the latest exhibition of Assyrian art and ephemera. ""Ashurbanipal"" (to give it the shorter and less irritating title than the full version) is in a different league from most of the BM's recent offerings. It is something to be experienced in the real world, rather than Hokusai and Ian Hislop, which work just as well online or on the printed page.Rarely have I seen a display as imaginative and effective as this. With the minimum of gimmickry another world is opened up, almost as dramatic as that of Nineveh. There's education as well as special effects galore. A shame it attracts so many visitors. It can't be the title that did it.",Incredible
"December 2, 2018","I wasn't able to spend a lot of time going through every room and every item here, but what I did see amazed me! Being from Canada, it blew me away that you can see so much in such a well-known museum for absolutely free. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting London.",A good place to visit

"December 2, 2018","Tip - use the back entrance. Huge winding queue at the front, walked straight in at the back! Don’t dress too warmly as some of the galleries were sweltering.

So much more environmentally friendly than cotton buds!",Magnificent mummies
"December 1, 2018",I went here with a group of school kids to see the Egyptian displays! Wow! Didn’t expect to see quite as many artefacts as we did. The kids loved it! ,Pick and choose your exhibits
"November 27, 2018","The British Museum is a vast, and I mean VAST, treasure trove of antiquities and artifacts from around the world. The ground floor houses what I would consider to be the ""main"" exhibits, which basically takes you on a historical survey of western civilization from Ancient Egypt through Assyria and through Ancient Greece and Rome. I recommend picking up the museum-provided audio tour (which is free), or if you're a Rick Steves groupie, like my wife and me, you can download his excellent audio tour to your mobile. An audio tour will let you just wander from room to room throughout the main floor without feeling like you need to read every single panel next to every single piece. Then you can just breathe everything in and listen. An audio tour will take you through the main floor in a little more than an hour, not counting pauses to examine things more closely. We visited The British Museum on our final day of a week-long London trip, so we were museumed out and decided not to venture to the upper floors. I don't feel cheated though, because the main floor was more than enough to take in on our visit. Anything you visit on the upper floors is, in my humble opinion, just bonus.Rosetta Stone tip: Even on a weekday in November, there was still a huge lingering crowd of people that didn't seem to move surrounding the Rosetta Stone. There is an identical mold of the stone in another gallery on the main floor (I don't recall which room, but I just stumbled upon it, so keep walking through the galleries and you'll find it). I was surprised that no one was giving this mold any attention, even though it looked exactly like the real thing. If you want to take in the stone and really examine the carvings on your own, find this mold, and you'll have it all to yourself!",Better than I expected
"November 26, 2018","We've been flying through London for 30 years and never done the tourist thing, so decided that it was time to make up for it and the British Museum was on the list. So worth it but make sure you set aside a few hours to make the most of it.",Great visit
"November 18, 2018",Very interesting museum with a little bit for everyone.  I really enjoyed the Egypt exhibit and was amazed to see the Rosetta Stone up close and personal.  I wasn't expecting to see all the displays of treasure hoards found throughout the UK.  I also really enjoyed the interactive exhibits.  The staff was very knowledgeable and I liked being able to touch real history.  I spent over four hours walking around and I still barely saw half.  It was a busy Sunday morning so the crowds were thick but it was still worth the visit.   ,Worth a visit
"November 17, 2018",The British Museum has a great collection of extremely valuable artefacts from all over the world.I've spent 3 hours in there and I do not regret any minute of it.,Very interesting place to visit
"November 15, 2018",I can recommend this Museum.  You need at leat 3 hours to visit the main attractions.An on top of this : it is for free.,BRILLIANT!!
"November 12, 2018","WOW! This place is amazing! The British have been looting from all over the world as they conquered nation after nation. Inside this museum are the the riches from those plunders. Roman statuary, Egyptian mummies (Cleopatra!), European relics, it goes on & on. I shot over 300 photos there & only spent 3 hours. Don’t miss this gem!",Everyone must see it
"November 7, 2018",The British museum is a must-stop of a destination. The place is very  big and there have a lot to see.,Lovely huge museum with many interesting attractions
"November 6, 2018",I visited this museum with my mum . It’s a very nice huge museum . It has more floors. If you go there one day not enough to see everything. Wherever you go there in every rooms you find something interesting. From young to old. Every generation can find their interest their . This museum is ready for families as well. When we were hungry we could eat downstairs where we bought sandwiches and drink . I really offer to everyone to visit it not once minimum twice .,Wished we had more time
"November 5, 2018","Great museum and exhibits. There was a big crowd, but everything was very smooth. We had a couple of hours to spare but wished we could have spent the entire afternoon.",Rosetta Stone and Cleopatra!
"November 4, 2018","Exquisite museum, featuring gorgeous sculptures, the Rosetta stone and don't overlook the mummies on the second floor (including Cleopatra!!)",Incredible
"November 4, 2018",Wonderful museum. Well organised. It is a pleasure to visit. Some impressive pieces. And all of this is free of charge !,Always amazing
"November 4, 2018","I've been twice in 6 years and it's only gotten better. It's so easy to get wrapped up in the mummies but there's so much more. Make for at least a few hours. Even outside there's a lot going on with performing artists. The difference between now and 6 years ago...security. You now have to have your bags checked and I'm sure the line early in the day can get quite long, but we went around 3ish on a Friday so the line was shorter. Afterwards, find a small quiet restaurant in the neighbourhood to rest your weary feet.",Museum tour
"November 1, 2018",This was a fascinating 90+ minute tour of the highlights of the museum. Our guide was a wealth of information and amusing at times. He had a great perspective of history and could explain the part the treasures we saw played in the overall progression. Our tour went longer for those who were interested so our guide could show us more. It was wonderful and well worth the fee through the museum!,Not to be missed
"October 30, 2018","The British Museum is a wonder, with so many outstanding treasures.  The Rosetta  Stone is the first treasure that greets you as you enter.  After tha, t one gallery after another will astounded you with their wonders. The Elgin Marbles Room is truly amazing and the marbles are mounted so as to allow a close up view.  The Egyptian mummies are another highlight, as is the Piltdown Man.  There is far to much to see in one visit, but even a small taste is rewarding.",Amazing exhibits
"September 12, 2018",FREE museum with very impressing exhibits of greek and egyption artifactsWe really enjoyed the visit.  Highly recommended it.,Dropped in for a short visit to avoid the rain.
"September 9, 2018","While in London on a 4 day trip, trying to see as much as possible we dropped in for a quick visit and it was well worth it. ",Must visit 
"September 7, 2018","The museum has many interesting pieces from the beginning of civilization, from Egypt, Middle East, Ancient Greece and many others... I learned new things about Egyptians and other ancient cultures. I liked the The organization of the artifacts and different sections. It was easy to navigate between eras and civilizations. Tip: I had to wait for a huge cue, as I visited there on a Sunday afternoon during the high season. Maybe going there during the week might be a better idea.  ",One of the best museums in the UK if not the World
"September 4, 2018","The British Museum is not only about the British, but all ports of the Globe. It has son many interesting objects in the museum you will be amazed and its free how many world class museums in the world are free I would so none. Example the Louvre of Paris is quite expensive. The Museum has history on Artefact , China, Greece Romans and Egyptians etc. The building has been modernised by one of Britain's for most Architects Lord Foster. There are many Cafes in the foyer to rest your feet and just to chill and to take in all the splendours of this great Museum and what it has to offer. The museum puts on special shows from other countries and example was the Terracotta Army of Sian of China excellent value and very interesting. This exhibition was about the first Emperor of China. The location of the British Museum is near to Holborn, but is a short walk from Covent Garden, which is a beautiful place in the heart of the city of London.You must visit the British Museum and just pay a small donation or not. ",Amazing Egyptian Collection
"September 2, 2018",We were very impressed by the Egyptian Collection with mummies. The “radio” representation is great to get an idea of the  living person. Discover Rosetta was great. As we were with young child we did not stay too much but we will come back to visit other collection.,Great collections from all over the world
"September 1, 2018","This is the bigger museum in London. You can see Egyptian art with an actual reconstruction of the entrance of an ancient tomb and pieces from ancient Greece, Asia, China, India... Plan two days to manage to visit the entire exposition. Don't miss it!",British Museum
"August 28, 2018","The museum is amazing. I have spent time there twice, and would love to go again. The Egyptian rooms are fantastic. The only problem is the crowds. Both times I've been there have been numerous school groups, and I was lucky to get close to many of the displays. It is too bad there are not designated times for school kids, and times just for the general public. It is a wonderful museum though, and well worth spending several hours in if possible. ",Must see
"August 28, 2018","A truly an awesome eperience , you got to see priceless treasures from every place in the world. A real must see ",The British Museum's Special Program are Historic
"August 27, 2018","The British Museum has significant pieces of world history and is always a rewarding visit.  We have been many times and always enjoy renewing experiences we have enjoyed before - the Rosetta Stone, the Lewis Chess Pieces, the 7th Century B.C. Flood Tablet,  the Portland Vase, and thousands more.  You can always visit another room or presentation for the first time and find more to see in the Museum.  In addition, the Museum enhances the range of experiences with special programs.  Last month the Rodin special program was outstanding.  Several Rodin pieces were on loan from Paris.  They were arranged in a separate showing room with pieces from the British Museum's Elgin Marbles that inspired Rodin to create many of his magnificent sculptures.  The placement of Rodin pieces alongside the Elgin Marbles that inspired him was itself inspired.  Reading and listening to commentary before and after was instructive.  Even better, the Rodin special program empowered you to sculpt your own understanding of the relationship between Rodin's creations and the Elgin Marbles by seeing Rodin and Marbles side by side.   Well done.",Valuable experience!
"August 27, 2018","The museum is far one of the best museums in London. The archive is great and well presented. My only advice would be to do in quiet days, weekend is a nightmare, too crowded!!!",Amazing museum!
"August 11, 2018",This museum was on my bucket list for a long time!Home of the Rosetta Stone it was very much worth the trip. Do try to this this first as it does get crowed fast. Check their website for current exhibits.The entry is free but make sure you check the times and leave yourself enough time.The lines get long in the morning but moves. My hotel was almost across the street so I had the opportunity to go back a second time easily.Two hours prior to closing was perfect for us as the larger crowds weren't a provlem.There an area for eating and a wonderful gift shop in the once you enter the main area. This is a must see museum.,Amazing
"August 9, 2018","The best part of the museum is that entrance is free. For the type of antiquities that they store, that is phenomenal. As with most exceptionally curated museums, one can spend days inside the British Museum. The Egyptian and Mesopotamian exhibits alone could take a whole day.",A Fabulous Place 
"August 9, 2018","We have visited here more times than I can remember and we pay for “Friends” membership (I’m considering stopping this after today’s visit) The Artefacts on display should be in everyone’s bucket list to see, however today’s visit has left a bad taste in my mouth by the appalling attic of the security staff at the end of the day. The bottom had ripped on my shopping bag a kind assistant in the gift shop gave me an extra bag as it was clear the contents were about to spill, she offered to help transfer the stuff but it was so busy I took it outside so as not to hold the queue up, my young son and I got out and I put my bags on a bench to start moving things when a woman security guard frostily shouted at us to “get out, move down” I was speechless at the way she spoke to us and she then turned to an elderly man and shouted at him “to hurry up” at this point I told her she was rude she continued to yell get out. as we were herded from the place by another woman this one with a whistle like we were sheep dogs. I take a lot of time telling my son about being polite and helpful, what an awful example their staff set! I will be writing directly to the museum. ",Wonderful musuem
"August 9, 2018","The British Museum rivals The Met in NYC.  It has extensive, interesting exhibits and seems never-ending. There is so much to see and such diverse exhibitions.  I always love the Elgin Marbles.","Too hot, crowded and smelly"
"August 7, 2018","Heard a lot about this museum. I visited this museum on one of the hottest days of the year. Firstly, the queue was very long. Secondly, the map made no sense. Thirdly, it was extremely hot in the museum which had no AC! Fourthly, after getting over the heat the toilets were smelly, had long queues and hot water running in the taps which made things worse. Last but not least, there were a lot of tourists from China. It seemed as if they had booked the museum for themselves, which is fine but crowd control must be an issue if there was ever god forbid a serious incident in the building. I couldn't concentrate on the displays at all. Just had to leave immediately by following the exit signs. May return on a colder day and when there are fewer people around. Overall, the building itself is huge and beautiful inside. You need patience and a cold drink if you are visiting in the summer months!","Very, very busy"
"August 6, 2018",Great museum but try and pick your time to go. Gets very crowded. Reading Room was also shut which was disappointing.,Nice venue
"August 6, 2018",Very nice variety of exhibitions.  Free unless you want to donate(I recommend).  Only reason we didn’t relate it higher is that they had no available audio headsets for the walking tours.,"Go to see the Elgin Marbles, and the Rosetta Stone."
"August 2, 2018","Go to see the Elgin Marbles, and the Rosetta Stone. Check out the covered courtyard with the Reading Room. If it's open, go inside, to be in the same room where many great writers did their work.",There’s a reason when you tell people you’re looking for “The Museum” they know this what you’re looking for ...
"July 30, 2018","One cannot walk through The British Museum without feeling somewhat underdressed for the occasion... that is unless youre sporting a brown leather jacket, matching felt fedora with a worn whip attached to hip. Set off by a rugged 4 day beard and sun-soaked tan, picked up after a week scouring the Middle East for treasures and fighting Nazis to save the world. That is, of course, because The British Museum makes all its visitors feel like Indian Jones. In his Prime I hasten to add (like all good ‘Indi’ fans we’ll ignore the Crystal-thingy-majig episode). With exceptional exhibitions showcased alongside the world envied permanent collection amassed from the spoils of gentleman explorers and rogue historians of a by-gone age. An age when being British meant having the curiosity to set one’s gaze up at the stars and across the seas to Europe and beyond - a long cry from the reckoning of the ignorant and insular on June 23 2016. What “je ne sais quoi” the Museum lacks when compared to its more en vogue and imperially impervious, if not a little pastiche, South Kensington rival (the V&A to the uninitiated) it makes up for in good old charm. And to that charm, the curators and the rest of the Museum’s staff I shall tip my brim.",Worthy of many visits and revisits
"July 26, 2018","We have been to this museum on two separate occasions , approximately 3 years apart.. Each of our visits was at least 3-4 hours long and i feel that if I am fortunate to live long enough and get back to London several more times in my lifetime, I will always schedule another visit to the British Museum. One must always be selective in what you try to see as the museum can be overwhelming.Would always suggest you go to the information booth and find out when and where free tours are being given. The guides are very knowledgeable and quite conversant in the areas in which they lead tours. We try to take at least two per visit.",Simply a must
"October 1, 2018","It keeps amazing me. Always something new to see. Now they are making it hard not to donate, which is fair. Something for something.",Treasures of the British Empire
"October 1, 2018","The marble statues, the Rosetta stone, the great relics of the past and the fabulous art of ancient civilizations. You can really feel awed within these walls. It's free and it's another place that should be seen. On a rainy day, it can't be beat. ",Well worth the visit 
"September 30, 2018","I saw so much and yet I didn't see enough. There was just not enough time on my schedule to take it all in and I am oh, ever so regretful. In hindsight I wish I had allocated more time. If you ever do go to London, make sure you plan to take more time than you expect. London is such a cultural hub that you owe it to yourself to do it right. Take your time. Don't rush. See it all. And definitely put the British Museum on your list. ",Amazing museum!  So much to see!
"September 30, 2018","This huge museum has an amazing collection, including the Rosetta Stone. Entry is free, though some tours cost money.   It would take many hours or days to see and appreciate it all. Art and historical artifacts are well displayed, with helpful descriptions. We came on Sunday, and it was packed with people.  One way to be sure of not missing the highlights is to take the aptly named Highlights Tour, as we did, for a cost.  My partner loved it; I was less enthralled for two reasons: first, the guide walked very fast and made no attempt to be sure everyone on the tour was with him (a challenge since there were so many people and he did not have a flag or any other way to be seen over the many heads), and second, his commentary focused more on who donated the pieces and how they were found, as opposed to the historical context and what they meant (the latter was more my interest but others might prefer his focus).  If you're able to stay with the guide, though, it's a great way to be sure you can see the museum's most famous pieces in 90 minutes.",Nice museum
"September 28, 2018","This museum is beautiful, and I would definitely recommend everyone to visit this place. I think it is good for everyone",Best of the best
"September 22, 2018","There's no way to do justice to this incredible museum.  It's vast and chock-full of exhibits and specimens.  Like similar great museums in the world from the Louvre to the Smithsonion to the Uffizi, it will help to go with some idea of what you want to see.  My only problem here is that the exhibits are ordered thematically rather than chronologically, so while I went wanting to see things from the Anglo Saxon period of English history, I found things related to this chronological period spread among several exhibits (pottery shrds, weapons, farming toolds, etc.  ",British Museum 
"September 21, 2018","Nice way to spend a few hours on a rainy day, as we did. There you will see the Rosetta Stone. They have a large collection of Greek and Egyptian artifacts that are in pristine condition. Check schedule as some days are free. ",Free dive into history
"September 20, 2018","It‘s fantastic to have free access to public museums all over London anyways. To be able to visit this one for free as well makes it even better. This way you can freely decide if you want to check out the entire building, which would probably easily take an entire day or if you just go for a few pearls. We went to the egyptian part including the Rosetta stone (helped translating the hieroglyphs) and several mummies. We then also got to enjoy a free tour with a really nice guide, telling us everything about the ancient empire and how mummifications came to be etc. After that we also enjoyed the Enlightenment sector, in which all types of research including biology, petrology, history etc. are presented. I recommend it to everybody as it is free and you don’t lose any money, even if you just check out the architecture of the building itself, which is impressive itself. ",Obviously one of the greater museums in the world
"September 19, 2018","Even though you might want to ask yourself the question wheter certain collections should still be displayed here or should be given back to where they originally came from, the British museum displays a richt collection from Ancient Egypt such as mummies to Ancient Greek with its famous Parthenon Frieze and the Rosetta Stone just to mention a few. An extremely varied collection of all different kind of interesting objects from the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and Americas are displayed in a splendid way and will make this visit last way longer than you could anticipate on. The architecture of the museum is worth a visit in itself. You can't really visit London without visiting the British Museum. Will definitely go back during my next trip, despite that fact that I have been there 6 times by now.",Amazing place
"September 14, 2018",This surprised me in making history come alive. Who knew the Assyrians had such great art? Not me!The Egyptian room was especially impressive. Well laid out! Too much to see for one day. Loved it!,Amazing place with no entry free

"February 23, 2018","The British Museum is a massive and fabulous place to visit with a wide range of exhibits from across the globe. I didn't manage to see every section of the museum, however, I did see quite a bit within a couple of hours. They have a few Egyptian mummies on display, anglo saxon artefacts and everything in between. They also have a very good Asian collection as well as a few great exhibits from Australia and New Zealand. The cafe was packed, so if you want to eat I recommend eating at a nearby cafe/restaurant or bring your own food. ",Spectacular museum
"February 21, 2018","This is a must-go-to place that I have been telling all my friends about. Been there now 3 times and still learn more and more. Beautiful structure although I prefer the new section. The solarium with cafes, bookshops etc. are a great place to collect your thoughts and grab a beverage and food while the London sun soaks through the glass. The exhibits are phenomenal as well.",Museumvisit

"January 30, 2018","this place is huge. enormous. gigantic. it would take about 2-3 days to go thru the entire place. so pick what you want to see and look for the highlights. no entrance fee, worth the cash lump sum donation. 2 pounds for a map with the highlights... worth it. the Rossetta stone was mind boggling. all the artifacts in the world is here. everything missing or in pieces ( the parthenon, nose of the sphinx of Egypt, cleopatra....) are found here. this is a must see.",good

"January 23, 2018","I love history and in this museum is a lot of interesting exhibits, but there is no space and athmospere for enjoyment. Visitors must wait for toilets 15minutes.

"August 30, 2017","This museum is global!  I would rate it as a very important museum worldwide. The Rosetta Stone is there along with many Egyptian and Greek treasures. I mean original treasures!

"August 25, 2017",I visited British Museum last Saturday. Queue was not big. First surprise was that at the gate all families with children were forwarded to the member entrance for free. I guess it was a free day for families with small children. We spent a couple of pleasant hours there. My favourite collections were the Egypt and Japanese ones.,Almost Overwhelming... In A Good Way
"August 25, 2017",An incredible museum displaying thousands of antiquities from all over the world. This is an educational opportunity not to be missed. For me the history of clocks and timepieces was fascinating along with the explanatory digital media presentations.,Too much of a good thing...
"August 18, 2017","There is just so much to see here that is all gets a little overwhelming. Select a few things you're particularly interested in and focus on those and the time spent here seems a little more worthwhile. Not sure why it's called the British Museum - the vast majority of the artefacts on display were acquired (and/or pilfered) from every corner of the globe (and should probably be returned to their rightful owners, truth be told) but if you are looking for an overview of the history of world civilisations in one place (and for free) then this is the place to go. And they sell good food and coffee to...",Simply the Best

Just savor what you love...for me it was the Elgin marbles and Egyptian rooms.",Great fun!

"March 9, 2017","What else needs be said? But they are making me type more, so here it is: Britain conquered the world, and is now ashamed of it.  But you shouldn't be, because the museum is filled with all the riches and glory conquest brings with it. Enjoy. ",Not bad

Thirdly, you need more than one day to do it justice! We spent almost a whole day in the Egyptian section. Do track down the Rosetta Stone. The detail of the carving is unbelievable and this item unlocked thousands of years of history as it deciphered hieroglyphics. And the kids will like the Mummies.",Afternoon Tea

Easily reachable by bus.",New way to explore the museum 
"February 28, 2017","I recently listened to the phenomenally excellent podcast by the BBC and the British museum called ""A History of the World in 100 Objects."" It is still available as is an extremely good companion book that you can purchase in the British Museum's bookstore. Each episode of the podcast is about 12-14 minutes long. The narration makes even seemingly mundane objects in the museum completely come alive and some of the episodes are absolutely electrifying as well as enlightening. An example is a cabinet with some pottery jugs that do not look terribly interesting at first. When one listens to or reads the text of the podcast one finds that this is an example of a lost civilization called the Moche which once rivaled the Incas the Babylonians and the Egyptians. A thorough explanation of the history as well as the disappearance of the Moche people is given. This is the difference in just strolling through the museum and truly letting history illuminate one's imagination. Of course you must have time to do this but as I visit the museum two or three times a year I will henceforth try to search out some of these objects. ",Great Britain 
"February 25, 2017",I don't know why they call it British museum. You will see the influance of great Britain all over the world. Don't skip it,Always special

"June 9, 2017",I spent an entire day in this museum and barely scratched the surface of what is here to see and learn. Practically every location in the world is represented and practically every time frame since the beginning of human settlement is represented. It's amazing and overwhelming. Definitely plan out in advance what you really want to see and plan on taking breaks to rest your feet and give your mind a break. I can't wait to return and see some more of the collections here. ,Shocking discrimination
"June 6, 2017","Having a back injury and recognised as disabled I faced discrimination in the worst form as I wheeled round my bag carrying my iPad, diary and umbrella - although let in by the security manager at the main gate (there were signs that People were not allowed to take in wheeled luggage but I was). Then stopped by the security guard 256 who told me that I wasn't allowed to wheel my bag with me - he told me that I could carry it but I can't lift!He then told me that I was rude and condescending when I reminded him of the equality and diversity act.Rick (--) the British Museum Visitor representative came over and insisted that either I deposit it at cost in their cloakroom or my friend carried it.I noticed that there were people carrying knapsacks and bags, there were no mental detectors. As if I could possibly trip someone up with my small bag? There were baby strollers allowed, but no room for me!",Incredible place!
"June 4, 2017",It's amazing all the history there is in that place! definitively a place that must to be visited when staying in London.,Amazing
"June 4, 2017","One of my favourite musems in the world!It's so organized, interesting also for the kids! I spent lovley time there with my family",Awesome 
"June 4, 2017",It was a mind blowing experience.All ages are welcome to experience an astonishing view of different events and history.,Would love another full day here!
"June 3, 2017","I loved this museum.  There was so much to see, and with so much variety I can not imagine a single person not finding an area of personal interest.  They have a lot of free tours available - the most I have seen at any museum.  It was impressive.  It was packed today and would love to have had a little A/C in a few rooms, but it was easily manageable.  The directional signage and maps were really good.  The secruity lines entering the building were moving smoothly along and did not take an unreasonable amount of time.  Would love to spend at least another full day at the British Museum.",Amazing museum
"June 3, 2017","The collections are so varied and vast, that it is best taken in smaller doses. We have visited London many times and on each trip we manage to go back to the British Museum and visit a gallery we hadn't yet seen or sometimes go back to a favorite gallery. The layout is easy to follow for such a large museum. Security screening takes some time on busy days so plan accordingly.",Better than the Louvre!
"June 2, 2017","This museum has such amazing displays!  Not only do you see an item, but you learn about it's history.  For example, any mummy you may see will have any x-rays or ct scans with it, along with where it was found and what the test results were.  It's all laid out so beautifully, too. My favorite museum ever!",My favorite museum in London
"June 2, 2017","If you only have time to visit one museum in London, this one is the one I would recommend. My favorite parts were the Egyptian, Byzantine, Babylonian, Greek, and Roman sections. The Rosetta Stone is there!  It's amazing to be able to stand a few inches from the stone that unlocked the Egyptian hieroglyphs and opened up a world of information for archaeologists The Egyptian section includes statues of some of the most famous pharaohs as well as sarcophagi, mummies, pottery, and other artifacts. In the Byzantine, Mesopotamian, and Babylonian section, the winged lions with human heads that guarded the Byzantine gates and the cuneiform tablets from Babylonia were amazing. The collection of statues and artifacts from ancient Greek and Roman civilizations was immense. It just goes on and on. Also impressive were the Native American and Mexican sections.  Admission is free, so I would recommend two days at least for this wonderful museum. .",Amazing Ruins
"May 6, 2017","I'm not a history buff. I'm not an archeologist. Most museums with ruins tend to bore me because they have some weird Egyptian art. However, the British Museum has remarkable treasures from Egypt, Greece, and the rest of Europe. We didn't see the entire museum, which is another plus. It's layout is well suited for jumping in and taking off when ready. ",A lot to see
"April 28, 2017",Gorgeous space with loads of impressive artefacts. We mainly focused on Egypt  and Middle Eastern sculpture - lovely to be able to get so close to these wonderful artworks. Museum shop had lots of interesting things too.,Takes time!!
"April 27, 2017","An amazing and huge collection of artifacts from around the globe. Someone else said it best when they commented that you could easily have a history of the world right here at one museum. It's so big though, plan lots of time to see it all.",Family visit
"April 26, 2017","This is a must when in London, so many experiences to divulge in so many different cultures. You really need two visits to catch every experience, or a long day. You possibly could not take in so History in one day. We loved it.",A must-see for everyone
"April 23, 2017","The British Museum was the highlight of my trip to London. If you have even the slightest interest in history, I urge you to come and visit.The building itself is both iconic and practical, with a beautiful exterior and large center room built to handle the large number of visitors.The artefacts are truly magnificent. Highlights include the Rosetta Stone, relics from The Parthenon and the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. All awe-inspiring.My only criticism is that the pieces are kept within reach - great for feeling engaged with the history, but sad as people constantly disregard the ""no touching"" signs! I'm no archaeologist, but I assume those signs are put up with good reason? A shame.",Early visit
"April 23, 2017","Our visit began right after it was open. I felt like I saw more detail here, of the Egyptian pieces then I did when I was IN Egypt. Also being part Indigenous from Canada.  I saw the part with a lot of First Nations art &  traditional pieces. I'm glad they are showing the truth about what happened to indigenous people. Meaningful visit.",Many cultures in one place
"April 22, 2017","This museum has no more than 5% of British pieces in their collection, but the rest is a very interesting exposition of egiptian, Greek and Romanese cultures. You can even see great pieces from Mexico's Aztec culture. The museum is spacious and well designed. Even though has many visitors, it does not feel like a crowded place. It's definitely worth the visit  and it's even free.",British at its Best
"April 20, 2017","First a little hint, everyone uses the main entrance and there are large queues to get in.  In order to skip the queues, use a side entrance such as ontague place.  We walked straight in.Once inside take your time and enjoy the exhibits.  Get hold of a map and do two or three sections you really want to see before letting yourself get lost in the other rooms.  This is becuase you will need more than one visit to do everything. Compared to the Natural History Museum, this museum is laid out in a much better way and there are less people to have to try and navigate as a result. The Egypt section which contains the famous mummies and sarcophagus' will be busy no matter what time you go as that is a massive attraction to the museum.",Almost Hard To Wrap Your Head Around
"April 18, 2017","We visited the British Museum for several hours on Easter Sunday afternoon, so of course it was incredibly crowded. I was grateful I had a Rick Steeves ""Pocket Guide to London"" with me to guide us through several of the exhibits. His writing is very conversational and funny, and provided even more context to what we were seeing than the written descriptions at the exhibits themselves -- starting with his introduction that in the 19th century, more than 1/4 of the world was controlled by Britain, and this museum's collection reflects that. Rick Steeves' guide let us to seek out 2-4 specific items in each room within just three exhibits in the Museum -- so we were able to spend some time really looking and learning, rather than wandering aimlessly about. I was of course mesmerized by the Rosetta Stone and the Parthenon exhibits, and our 11- and 13-year-old kids loved all of the ancient Egyptian artifacts. We ran out of steam after a couple of hours -- a combination of a busy day and huge crowds -- but I would absolutely love to return and spend more time. I am so glad we were there. Extraordinary.",Really great place
"April 16, 2017","Really great place to visit, everything was there. No feeds to pay, no que at all. Amazing place, I was there with my wife, we walked about 2-3 hours and still we did saw just little but of The museum. Best museum In London and maybe In world. I would liked to come there later, maybe need to come London again 🤔🤔",Impressive
"January 9, 2017",The whole complex is just breathtaking and the stuff is very friendly and efficient!The Bistro is very recommendable!,Amazing place 
"January 8, 2017",Could have spend a week here but unfortunately wasn't very interesting for my wife.  Make sure you go alone or with someone who appreciates history.Would I recommend....YES Would I return .... YES,Prepare for the crowds
"January 6, 2017","How can you go to London without a stop at the British Museum? Especially  since many of the countries where it's treasures were ""discovered"" have asked for their return. Given our schedule, it was impossible to go anytime but the late afternoon, when it was the most crowded. But I was determined to see the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles, etc. I appreciated the fact that entry was free, and it has delightful gift shops, although it was lacking in sufficient bathrooms. Due to the crowds we only stayed for two hours, but it was exhilarating to see things you have read about.",Worth visiting
"January 2, 2017","The museum is huge, there is so much to see - you will need at least half a day if you want to see a few of the exhibits.  The architecture of the museum is beautiful.","One of the most important museums in the world, a must!"
"January 1, 2017",This museum has collections of every continent and is a must. Try to be early (10 am) and be ready to walk at least 4 hours. I recommend audio guide for knowing more about selected items.,An absolute must see
"December 31, 2016","This is a fantastic museum that deserves at least a day's visit--even then, don't think you can see it all.  This a place you could go back to again and again and not see the same exhibit twice.  We went through the Egyptian, Assyrian, Roman-Greco and British Isle exhibits and were not disappointed.  The Assyrian exhibit was stunning--I almost cried when I went past the sphinxes--it was thrilling to see them.  Equally fascinating were the ""hoard"" exhibits in the British Isles exhibits--look them up, you will be astonished at the craftsmanship of these early peoples.  The exhibits are well laid out with good signage.  Our family did not include any young children, so we can't speak to how they might enjoy the museum but there were a lot of children there the day we went and they seemed to be enjoying the exhibits.  ",Very good
"December 31, 2016","A wonder of the world. Must be seen. It is quite tirying if you want to visit it all, but it is a phantastic experience. ",Easy to spend a whole day here
"December 21, 2016","I'm a huge museum fan and history buff, and I spent my whole day here from open to close. Admission is free, but I chose to rent an audioguide (they offer discounts for students) and I found that really enhanced my visit. The guide offers different tour options, so if you're looking to only spend an hour or two here before moving on, the guide will direct you to the museum's highlights (including the Rosetta Stone and statues from the Parthenon!).",Amazing resource
"December 15, 2016","Summary based on many visits:--amazing resource, extremely strong in some areas--free (donation requested)--some popular exhibits can be so crowded as to be unviewable--camera phones have transformed the experience to something like a rugby scrum--less visited areas are quite goodNow has a preliminary bag check in a sheltered tent, but no big deal. Lighting after sunset in the Great Court isn't very good.Selfie sticks and visitors without a clue are a threat.",Nice
"December 7, 2016","Nice just expected it to be more interesting and the infrastructure was little bit difficult, so we had been going circles.",A Glorious Center of Art and Architecture
"April 14, 2017",Rooms full of artifacts and art from all civilizations in the world.  Cafes and shops to accommodate your visit. Make sure you plan to spend a whole day because there is so much to see.,Must See
"April 13, 2017",The Rosetta Stone is amazing! Every person on Earth should see it. The ancient Egyptian art is truly worth a visit to the British Museum and London.,Worth the visit if interested in history
"April 8, 2017","It free, its a wonderful building and contains amazing history.I have always had an interest in Egypt and its history and the British museum has a lot of things to seeThe Rosetta stone is well worth the vist",Amazing!
"March 29, 2017","The  best attractions in London, so many great works, even the Rosetta stone is there! Simply a must-see",Excellent museum in London 
"March 28, 2017",Free entrance. Map for 2 pounds. Audio guide for 6 pounds. One of the best audio guides ever tested. I dedicated almost two hours on Egypt mummies and Greek sculptures. The museum is huge and almost infinite. Rosetta Stone is remarkable. ,Huge and Awesome
"March 27, 2017","London's museums are free of charge to enter.  That by itself is just amazing.  The British Museum did not disappoint.  The Rosetta Stone is the piece everyone knows, but the museum is full of so many other artifacts, artwork, and historical elements.  The staff is not pretentious and are willing to explain or educate if you ask questions.  We did not feel rushed or crowded.  This is a world class museum you should not miss during your trip to wonderful London!",All the World in one museum
"March 20, 2017",This is a must-see every time I'm in London. I think you could visit 100 times and not see it all. The original Rosetta stone is worth a look and the much-disputed Elgin (Acropolis) marbles have to be seen.,Wow!
"March 18, 2017","There is so much to see at this Museum that it can be intimidating. But, get a map, have a tea or coffee break and plan your visit.  I was with a friend and we went our own directions. Concentrate on the areas you like..there is no way to see it all. Just savor what you love...for me it was the Elgin marbles and Egyptian rooms.",Great fun!
"March 17, 2017",We have gone several times and we can't get enough.  We visit London two times a year and every time visit this museum.  Always great exhibits and never enough time to see it all.  So we keep going back.,Leading Global History Museum
"March 13, 2017","Aesthetically really interesting. Great long-term Egyptian exhibit with a lot of really nice travelling exhibits. Lots of great free exhibits from around the world - Iran, US, SE Asia, Ancient History, etc.",Best attraction in London
"February 1, 2017","This is undoubtedly one of the best attractions in London. It's free (except for certain exhibitions) and contains a history of the world in one place, from the Egyptian statues to the Greek marbles and so much more. It's wheel chair and pram accessible, has coffee shops and eating areas inside and out and is generally lovely day out. It is huge so might need more than one visit, but is very manageable if you only want to see certain exhibits.",TERRIFIC!
"January 30, 2017","A long journey around the World through the History: great and marvellous statues of the hellenic period, huge babilonian carved horses, the Rosetta Stone, Maya and Atzec finds, etcetera. And you can see all of this for free... but a little donation is welcomed (and a must)! ;)",Wonders From around the world
"January 27, 2017","Spending.a day at the British Museum is like giving yourself a masterclass of world heritage. This monument to the British love of travel and acquisition (purchased and plundered) is awesome in its scale. It may leave you slightly uncomfortable though, wondering whether the artefacts should be there at all, which you will have to contend with to balance the immense sense of enrichment you would have acquired from the experience of the visit.",A gem
"January 26, 2017","Yes, it can be crowded, & overwhelming. Do your homework before visit. It may take a few visits, to get a sense out of it. I went to BM every time I was in London, easily spent 3-4 hours each time. I enjoyed having a nice lunch there as well for a much needed break. There are many fantastic museums in the world, but this one is free, you can visit as many times as you like, and I never had to wait in a long line or any lines....so there are not anything one could complain. Maybe donate a few ponds to help with the institution.  Review the floor plan, pick a direction., or exhibits of interests to avoid overwhelming.  Last visit, I went in from other entrance instead of the main one, there was no line for the scrutiny.  ",British Museum
"January 20, 2017","A five minute walk from Holborn station . Well signposted route. Admission is free, and open late on Fridays. Fantastic museum with artefacts from ancient Babylon , ancient Egypt, Greece , India and from around the world . The museum map lays out a 45 min walk of the key exhibits , or a 2 hr walk with more details and there are free guided tours at different times of the day. It's worth sitting down and planning which rooms to visit as it's a lot to take in. I would suggest starting in room 4 on the ground floor, just off the main entrance hall. It's the ancient Egypt hall . The sheer size , and age of the items will take your breath away. Enjoy. ","Ask your Mummy to see, remind her it's free"
"January 19, 2017","This place is amazing if you like history and are interested in seeing real authentic pieces of different civilizations that the Brits ""collected"" over their world domination days. Rosetta stone is a big draw and gets engulfed by people as soon as the doors open. The egypt exhibit was amazing with real mummies and preserved bodies. It was pretty incredible to see. After that there are a lot of jars, pots, jewelry, etc. from civilizations of the past. Definitely the best collection of real (not casts) items that I saw out of any museums I went to in London.Tip: Get there early on weekends, place fills up fast and gets very noisy and crowded.",Wow but gets very busy
"January 14, 2017","We visited here over xmas which was no doubt a very busy time for the museum. It certainly has an exceptional collection of artifacts collected from the expeditions from many British explorers over the years (and don't ask, they are not giving any of it back!) I particularly enjoyed the Egyptology and Ancient Greek sections. The day we visited was so busy, all of their toilets could not take the strain and they closed half an hour early due to a plumbing issue! Recommend hiring the audio guide for a cost of 6 pounds. Again it was so busy they were all out when we got there (12 PM) and so we queued to get one at 2 PM. 2nd recommendation - get there early!! It still cant be beaten for a free activity to do in London. The glass ceiling over the entry courtyard is a piece of architectural beauty alone.",Where is the British History
"January 13, 2017","Maybe I missed something, but I thought I was going to see loads and loads of UK, English, British, London, etc History.  There was some, but I think I learned more about Egypt, Italy and Greece...and now there is an American exhibit coming?!  I was excited to come, but about an hour or so in I got bored.  All the open exhibits started to run together and some looked like the bricker brack cabinets in my grandmother's dinning room.  I loved the architecture of the building and I bought a book about it along with some other reasonably priced museum books.  I would have eaten something, but I am not a fan of food that is left out with a cover...too many kids about to chance it.   I have been to museums around the world and this is by no means the worst, but I guess I was expecting something different.","More interesting than you'd think, even for a couple of hours"
"January 12, 2017","Massive collection of artefacts, but its easy to find the headliners and we didn't feel overwhelmed by the size of it.You can spend a long time here but it also works for a couple of hours with kids - good option if you're in this corner of London and want an interesting diversion from shops....",Culture experience
"January 11, 2017",First thing I did upon getting to London. Absolutely loved the range of work. My favourite was the Egyptian exhibit. Great way to spend the day and appreciate the histories of the world under one roof.,Multiple visits; still much to see
"July 10, 2017","This was my third visit to the British Museum. On previous visits I had spent most of my time in ancient civilizations: Greece, Rome, and Egypt. Those collections are some of the best in the world and well worth the majority of my time spent on two previous visits. The Rosetta Stone is also worth a visit of its own. This visit, though, I managed to move on to other displays including Britain from 800 BC through Medieval Europe which occupied a good four hours reading display descriptions and viewing artifacts.A few pointers: Admission is free. If you are on a budget, you may want to print out a map ahead of time, although you can pick up a free map, with limited descriptions, inside the Great Court. Guide books and more detailed maps are for sale.The Great Court restaurants can get very busy. There is a pizzeria is the southwest corner (through room 12: Greece 1050-520 BC) that may be less hectic should you opt for dining within the museum.",Excellent!
"July 7, 2017","This is a must see museum if you are visiting London, it has an amazing wealth of items that would interest even people who don't normally like museums. The place looks fabulous. The only downside is that there are a lot of people there, since the tour buses bring tourist there pretty much daily. So you really want to get there a few minutes before they open. I love that their brochure highlights all the must see items/exhibits and gives their exact location within the museum, so if you only have an hour or two to spend there you will see the most important things if you follow their suggestions. ",Just thrilling
"July 7, 2017","This museum is such an amazing place,Its very big with great ventilation and this place have lots and lots of historic monuments and huge collection of old stuff,every corner of this museum has display showing directions for specific collectionmust visit place with family and friends because it also have a huge lawn where you can chill after long walk around the museum.",Amazing Antiquities
"July 6, 2017","What an interesting experience the British Museum is! Full of ancient marvels from many civilizations. See mummies (even cat mummies), the rosetta stone, the Elgin marbles from the Parthenon, and much, much more! ",Incredible Collection
"July 5, 2017","Headed here with wife and 9 year old daughter, quick to get into the Museum on a weekend and easy to navigate our way through various exhibits. Very traveller friendly. Fascinating facts about life in Ancient Egypt. So much more to explore so would love to go back. Had a tasty pizza there too.",Dedicate a whole day to see!
"July 5, 2017","The museum is free to visit, but that does not mean there is not an astonishing amount of things to see inside. Unfortunately I was in a bit of a time crunch and only had two hours to look around, but you certainly can spend an entire day here and still not see it all. It contains a wealth of artifacts, history, and information, and for me it was a very humbling experience to see it all. ",Great family outing!
"July 4, 2017",Wonderful collection of artifacts - kids and adults loved the visit!  The free entry is also much appreciated.,Pleasant surprise with teens
"July 3, 2017","Museum is a nasty word in our family except to me the Mom, but I require each kid choose a museum to visit , every major city we see when we travel so.... one of our kids chose The British Museum. I got the usual as we walked up ""How long so we have to stay? Do we have to do a tour?"" Etc etc. To my great surprise, they found this family interactive audio tour/ game and before I knew it, it was 2 hours later and the museum was closing and they wanted to stay longer! Shocked! We are going back. Very happy. The Greek exhibit is excellent-- especially since we have seen the other half at the Acropolis museum in Athens and they tell a different story about how all the remains ended up in London! Definitely worth a trip with teens, get the family game guide. I thought our 15 year old twins might be too old for it but were not. Since it's free, going twice is not a bad idea if you have the time OR visit for an hour or 2 in morning, go to lunch around the area, then wonder back. ",Wow!
"June 29, 2017","Absolutely loved this museum! Could have spent multiple days here! We only spent about a half day at the museum as we had many other things on our list to see in London. The exhibits are very well done. We explored the Roman and Egyptian sections and were floored by the beauty of the exhibits. The Parthenon and mummies were my favorite. Can't get over the fact that this museum is free of charge! Just a slight wait to get through security and you are in a world of wonder. Easy to get to. Walking distance from the tube station. Highly recommended! Didn't really notice if there was air conditioning or not. It seemed warm inside and we visited on a cool day so dress accordingly, but an absolute must see!",Always amazing
"June 29, 2017",Without question one of the finest museums in the world. Leave yourself plenty of time as there is plenty to see.,Nice free museum. Great restaurant inside.
"December 4, 2016","We were here for about 4hrs before we headed to Oxford street. This museum is free but accept donation, very well maintained. I highly recommend to visit this museum and do eat at the restaurant inside of the museum if you have time. The food is excellent.",Great Stop on Your Visit to London
"November 28, 2016","The British Museum is giant - you could easily spend an entire day there and still might not see everything.  If it's your first time and you don't want to spend the entire day at the museum, I highly recommend downloading Rick Steve's podcast that takes you through some of the major highlights of the museum. It allows you to feel like you've seen a lot, but gives you plenty of time to add more items to your itinerary for the day!",Always a pleasure
"November 28, 2016",A lovely day to take kids (of all ages) Plenty to see and to interest everyone. Beautiful building. Easy to get access to. ,Walk through World History!!!
"November 26, 2016","Visiting The British Museum is a MUST during a touristic stay in London.It is one of the oldest public Museums in the world and you can see objects from all our the planet here in one spot and learn a lot about different cultures. And amazing enough, it is free of charge to visit the Museum as it is the case with a number of other outstanding Museums in London. The Asian collection is closed at this moment due to reforms gong on on that section of the museum. However the Middle East section which is a true highlight of the collection is open and spectacular as ever. Don´t try to see everything in one day. Their is free admission which means that you can come back another day to  visit other parts of the huge collection. The Audio Guide which you have to pay for was really good and worth using.So enjoy your walk through the history.",Wow!
"November 22, 2016","This museum is amazing!  I have been to many museums in Europe and this one still surprised me!  So much valuable artifacts collected from all over the world.  We spent 5 hours in the museum and covered less than half of the exhibits (would love to stay longer, but seriously could not walk anymore).  We focused on the Egyptian and Chinese Jade/Ceramic exhibits.  They were truly amazing.   The museum is huge and it is impossible to see everything in a day.  It is best to focus on the few that are most interesting to you and then come back in another trip to see the other parts. ","Amazing collection, even if half of it is stolen"
"November 12, 2016","This is one of the most impressive museums I have ever visited. I spent all day here and needed at least one more to see everything. Wide range of historical artifacts, with emphasis on Greek, Roman, Egyptian history. It is also free. I went off-season (but during school break) and it was crowded but not claustrophobic. I ate in the center food court which was reasonably priced with good food, but with limited seating. Definitely worth a visit. ",If time stood still...
"November 10, 2016","Marathons have 42 kilometers and every one of those is just as important. Likewise, the British Museum has over a 100 rooms/galleries stocked with sculptures, paintings and several other artefacts from civilisations dating back over thousands of years. Having visited over several occasions we are yet to explore a greater part of it. An average day out would last 2-3 hours after which your appetite for anymore is diluted with comfort breaks, meal times and concentration spans.

"November 2, 2016","...And learn. Jam-packed with interesting exhibits. Choose one or two. This museum is huge and crowded and could become overwhelming. Look at the website for the special exhibitions and book ahead so you aren't shut out. then use the special security line for ticket-holders. Go see Underwater Archaeology --not to be missed--on view til Nov 27, 2016 ",Busy
"November 1, 2016",Visited the special exhibition over the lost cities discovered in Egypt - fascinating. Exhibition finishes soon so would highly recommend to go now.,One of the best!
"October 31, 2016",You could easily spend the whole day at the British Museum! It's a huge gorgeous building and has something for everyone! My favorite exhibit is the Egyptian mummies! There are so many mummies both human and animal! They are displayed so all can see and the history of them is explained very clearly.  The Egyptian artifacts are something to see also.  The museum houses the Rosetta Stone and a statue from Easter Island plus numerous sculptures and relics from all thru history.  It is truly one of the great museums in the whole world!,Must See
"October 4, 2016","The British Museum was on the top of our must see list in London, and after visiting, can say it was wonderful. One could literally spend hours here, and still not see everything, so we decided to focus on what we really wanted to see to ensure our visit was a quality one. Definitely add this to the list of must see in London! ",Simply Over-Crowded; Exhibits Poorly Set Up
"October 4, 2016","I have given up on the British Museum.  It's always jammed; the special exhibits aren't arranged to facilitate good flow of people, so it's impossible to see what's on display - it's like being on the Underground at rush hour.  Really - why bother?",Enjoying the British Museum
"October 3, 2016","Spent a wonderful day in the British Museum.  Amazing collection, especially in ancient artifacts, including the Rosetta Stone  Nice places to stop for a bite to eat, and accessible and well-stocked gift shops.  We got there right when it opened on a Sunday and it got very crowded very fast.  Check on the collection and go to the areas that interest you first.",Great experience
"September 27, 2016","We walked from our hotel and timed our arrival to coincide with the museum opening to beat any crowds. As soon as I entered the building I new o was in for a treat. The ""Lobby"" for lack of a better word was already stunning. The scope of artifacts on display was astounding. Egyptian exhibits was jaw dropping. It's easy to navigate and best of all, it's free. A great way to spend a little or a lot of time depending on what you want to get out of your visit. Anyone with any interest in what the museum has to offer should definitely invest some time and have a look. ",A day of history
"September 24, 2016",We got there as the doors opened and spent most of the day wandering around this great museum. If you like to read all information supplied. Give yourself the whole day in enjoy. ,A must see in London
"September 22, 2016",So much to see and it's all fantastic.  I'm a history nut & i could have spent the entire day looking at all of the exhibits.  I especially love the Egyptian & Roman exhibits.,Everything from Rosetta stone to Vikings
"September 17, 2016",You could spend days here exploring all the exhibits. The middle part is very spacious and gives a good feeling.,Mesmerizing and Everything I thought it Would Be
"September 14, 2016","Having always been interested in Ancient Egyptian history, the British Museum was definitely a place I wanted to see. I easily spent hours here, wandering through the exhibits. Go early if you can to beat the large amounts of tourists, especially if you want to get up close to the Rosetta Stone. ",Amazing ancient treasures in the middle of town
"September 13, 2016","This museum is worth making time for. It is one of the many treasures London has to offer and let's you travel to far away places while remaining in the center of this vibrant city. When we see what is happening to some of the historical treasures of Iraq and Syria, it makes us appreciate even more those forward thinkers who made a move to protect architectural treasures in times of destruction, and preserve them here, for us all to enjoy. I will never look at the trim on a building the same way again...",A must stop
"September 12, 2016","I go here everytime and I'm always amazed. Do yourself a favor and pick up the audio tour when you arrive. It makes a huge difference, but talk about a trip around the world in one building. ",So much to see
"August 5, 2016",One can easily spend a whole day exploring this beautiful museum. If time is limited you should download recommended plans from the museum website to help you see the highlights in a relatively limited time frame.,Sunken City
"August 1, 2016","One of the biggest archaeological sensation of recent years was the excavation of two Greek trading posts off the Egyptian coast. History, excavation and artifacts are  beautifully presented and this special exhibition was well worth it's money I thought.",Big museum
"July 29, 2016",It's huge--lots to see. Pretty cool but rather overwhelming. If you pace yourself you might be able to get through the whole thing but I might suggest picking a couple of high interest areas and just hitting those. ,Huge museum with huge soul
"July 29, 2016",There is a LOT to see here - you need a couple of days to finish the lot. Lots of statues and art. Be sure to visit early or late to avoid the rush. I also recommend the giftshop with great and helpful staff.,A fantastic place 
"July 28, 2016",British Museum is a fantastic place to explore. You will need about 4-5 hours if you'd like to see everything. There are places to sit and rest. Best of all it is free of charge. ,A truly impressive museum!
"July 26, 2016","The British Museum is one of my favourite museums in London! From it's impressive exterior, to the stunning Great Hall, the architecture of this museum is a suitable backdrop for the beautiful artefacts that are held inside it! While it is free to enter the museum, it is worth while looking up what special exhibitions are currently being hosted at the museum, as they are generally worth paying to see! This is a must for anyone visiting London...as well as a lovely day out for any Londoners!",So Much to See
"July 19, 2016","This museum has it all. Some of the mummies, and pieces of the Parthenon will take your breath away. We spent most of a day and could have even stayed longer. There was something noteworthy at ever turn. The upstairs restaurant had very good food as well.",A must see! 
"July 15, 2016","A beautiful museum was so much to see! The audio guide was fantastic, easy to use. Would recommend getting a map and navigating through the museum that way. Egyptian rooms are a must see! ","Extremely interesting, but crowded"
"July 14, 2016","We toured the British Museum on a weekday morning with hundreds of school children apparently on school sponsored excursions. The displays were well organized and beautifully done, with excellent notes explaining the origin and context of the objects displayed. The displays of artifacts from ancient Greece and Rome were outstanding, but the artifacts from the pre-Greek middle east (Egypt and Mesopotamia) were unique and particularly interesting. It is impossible to do justice to this extraordinary museum in one day: plan at least 2 days, but separated by a day or two of rest, and try to time your visit for when the crowds of school children are smaller.",Loved it
"July 10, 2016",WowWhat can I say this place is AMAZING.I really loved the fantastic selection of artifacts and information about the Babelon empire and the Assyrian empire and Persian empire.The Mummy exibition was brilliant as well.,Not great or what I had expected
"June 2, 2016","Too big, too busy, a bit impersonal and not that informative or fun. The national museum of Scotland shows how you can have a fun and informative experience. The British museum does not.",Superb
"May 31, 2016",Grand entrance with lots of interesting things inside.  I went here after buying an umbrella from the venerable James Smith and Sons store just around the corner.,Early bird catches the....
"May 31, 2016","Basically the Brits stole from the rest of the world and have nicely displayed their artifacts for our enjoyment. I would recommend going early and heading to the Rosetta Stone immediately. This is one of the main attractions, thus the masses congregate. I bought the map for £2 and that really expedited the tour. If you are on limited time or have all day the guide will get you to what interests you. Be sure to take awkward selfies with Greek statues. ",The Sun Does Not Set On The British Museum
"May 25, 2016","The museum gives an in depth look at the breadth of British discovery and power. The exhibits were phenomenal. The number of artifacts most impressive. From mummies to Japanese samurai warrior armor, this place is amazing. Only wish we had more time to explore. ",History of the world under one roof!
"May 20, 2016","The British Museum is a must visit on any tour of London. It is best visited without children and with no time constraints. It houses the most amazing collections of relics from the past. It's like walking through history. Depending on how much time one has, the visit should be planned and the attractions shortlisted. the museum website provides options for a one hour or three hour visit. The section with Egyptian mummies is simply spellbinding. They also have free tours at different times of the day, so history buffs should keep that in mind. To top it all, it's one of the rare attractions with free entry! An absolute not-to-miss attraction in London.",Great place to spend some time
"May 18, 2016",This is one of my favorite museums to visit in London. It is very large and there is so much to see. It does have free entry so don't feel like you need to see it all in one day. Frankly it can be a fun spot to go eat lunch and relax for a bit and take in some history and culture. I would recommend the audio tour guide if you enjoy history and learning. If your not a museum person it is still worth a visit. Try looking up some scavenger hunts to do in the museum or take silly pictures next to the statues to add some fun. ,Love the museum!
"May 16, 2016","The staff very helpful, and exhibits a real learning experience. Re dining: sit-down service is pricey &slow",Took Rick Steves' Walking Tour
"May 15, 2016","We visited the British Museum to take Rick Steves' walking tour.  The tour only took us through the ancient Egypt, Assyrian, and Greek rooms/artifacts.  Still, it was a terrific experience.  As a history lover, I enjoyed all of what I did see, and even learned a little more than what I had come in with.",Highlights tour
"May 15, 2016",The tour could have been much better... but still assigning 5 stars as the museum itself is absolutely amazing.,Great museum
"May 12, 2016","This is a wonderful museum! It just so happened to rain as we were arriving, so that was an added bonus. I Highly recommend the Rick Steve's free podcast for this museum. Very informative, and goes perfectly with one of my other favorite parts of the museum, FREE. :)",Best museum ever.
"May 7, 2016","Absolutely superb. This History teacher was very impressed. Can't say enough about this place. Suffice to say it should be on every visitor's list. I will keep coming back. The 'hands on' desks where you can handle some of the artefacts were thrilling. A big shout out to the staff of volunteers that tell the stories about the pieces, they were fabulous - especially the guy in the Enlightenment Gallery and the lady with the little Roman figurine (can't remember what it was called) she was hilarious and really informative. Great value - really enjoyed chatting about the pieces with her.",Too old fashioned in execution and layout
"May 4, 2016","We took our 2 sons (ages 8 & 4) as our eldest has covered a number of subjects in history class which are showcased in the British museum. Unfortunately, everything is still as I remember the museum (in terms of execution) from my childhood visit over 30 years ago. Exhibits behind glass, tiny labels to read with huge amounts of detail and a general feeling of formality. Unlike a number of museums in London which inform through interactive exhibits and displays-this museum feels completely retrospective and makes exhibits which should capture the imagination and give an amazing glimpse into the past, feel terribly dull.The building itself is quite lovely. It's free to enter but after only an hour, the kids were bored and I had to admit, so was I and we decided to leave for lunch in a restaurant we had spotted on the way in! Thankfully this was a much happier experience.It's worth noting, the mummy's in the Egyptian section scared the life out of my 4 year old and in hindsight, we should have been more selective in what he was shown as not only did the museum bore us to tears, it also left us with nightmares!Won't be back in a hurry-Natural History museum is in a different league!",Interesting 
"April 30, 2016",This museum is filled with interesting and unique artifacts from around the world. I felt like I had a world history refresher course! It wasn't too crowded -  there was plenty of space for the crazy photographing tourists and those who actually wanted to enjoy the museum. I really enjoyed seeing the Rosetta Stone and the Parthenon artifacts. Add this to the list!,world class museum
"April 25, 2016",So many things to look at! I wish I have more time to spend on this amazing museum. You can easily spend a day there. ,Not to be missed
"April 24, 2016","You cannot visit London and not visit the museum that displays artifacts from all aspects of human history.  There is something for everyone, although the Rothschild's collection is amazing, and of course you cannot miss the mummies.  Leave plenty of time for this museum because there is so much to see.",Always nice to visit
"April 19, 2016","We just love this museum. There is so much to see. Especially for our 8 year old, she would be so disappointed if we wouldn't visit the British museum when we are in London. ",Very Cool Place
"April 10, 2016",Visiting from America.  One of the best museums we have ever visited.  Cheers to the Brits for presenting history so well. Should be an example to the rest of the world.,The real challenge isnt to own artefact but to keep them safe.
"April 3, 2016","A huge amount of antiquities of quite all civilisations, its one of the best museum of the world,(but cairo have many more egyptian stuff).The history is hard for antiquities, quite all famous wonders or library have been burned or destroyed...and today its ironic to see that the first known Library (Ninive) is also the islamic state capital of obscurantism, and it is the large amount of pillaged and gathered object during the colonialism who save these treasures for us...So if the safiest way is to remain burried, the clever way could be to take more care of our heritage.","Fantastic and educational, if you have the time."
"March 30, 2016","This museum is so jampacked with incredible pieces of history, that you have to allot quite some time to appreciate it. Simply popping in to view the architecture is impressive! And you can also check out the Rosetta Stone and Elgin marbles during a quick visit. To indulge more, you really need a full day.I travel to London yearly, and pick just one thing (Ancient Greece, Victorian era, or jewelry for examples) that I would like to learn about each time. While in the area check out the Hunterian Museum for a little bit of creepy-cool. ",Quiet space
"March 30, 2016","We arrived tired and hungry on Easter Sunday. The crowds were unbelievable, no room to sit down (and we needed it!). Then we saw signs to a conference room/classroom down the stairs. Go down there and there's a huge empty space with comfy seats. We sat and ate our sandwiches in peace before going round the museum. Plus there are toilets down there with no queues....nobody seems to bother going down the stairs.",World History Tour
"October 7, 2015","From an outstanding collection of Greek and Egyption artifacts to the World famous Rossetta stone, this is one of the best museums in the World.mif you are in or near London you MUST make this a have to visit. It will take you at least 2 hrs just to,see the highlights, but it will be time well spent.",A Must See In London!
"October 6, 2015","An amazing museum with historic pieces from all over the world. Wherever you're from there's bound to be a piece or collection representing the history of your country and culture. Although quite overwhelming once you enter, It's not too difficult to find your way around the museum, being divided up into regions with plenty of maps everywhere to see where you are and where you would like to go next. It's safe to say It's one of, if not the most important museum in the world! And It's FREE!",Worth trying the ‘highlight’ tour.
"October 5, 2015","This Mother-of-all museums routinely has some 80,000 objects on display - you can't 'do' this in a single visit. So consider an investment in a 90 to 120 minute highlight tour; a highly knowledgeable guide will instruct you in the museum's history, its ethos, and the significance of around 15 key exhibits. You can still amble around on your own, either afterwards, or on a return trip.",Great Museum
"October 2, 2015",Undoubtedly this is one of the big museums in the world. May be even the biggest.It is not possible to see this museum in full even if you spend a whole week! So please select the sections you would like to visit. We selected the Indian section and a part of the egyptian mummies. This museum has a great collection of ancient Indian artefacts. Also on display are the relics of British Raj in India. Tipu's Sword is one of that.,So much to see!
"October 1, 2015",I would recommend to take a guided tour or and audio-guide for your visit. There are so many things to see and the little information signs aren't providing enough. The architecture of the building itself is beautiful and worth a visit.,cool
"September 30, 2015",i went to the British museum very fascinated in ancient history. I got there and as soon as i walked in i was swooned into believing that i was actually in that time period. It was truly truly amazing and i definitely consider going back sometime.,"Amazing museum, amazing collection, Amazing price (free)"
"September 29, 2015","When I had some time to kill in London I went to this museum. I had heard good stories about it and its collection, and wanted to see it for myself. It is the largest museum I have ever seen, collectionwise, almost without any paintings (these are located somewhere else, I was told). There was a lot to see inside the museum and they offered free 'eye-opener tours' in which a guide took you through an exhibition hall in about 30-45 minutes. All of this without charging anything for the admission!In short: amazing museum, amazing collection, amazing price!",Awesome British Museum
"September 27, 2015",A must see museum. Just awesome with an extensive gift shop and a great place for coffee just outside back entrance of museum in Montague Place.,A place for many visits when in London
"September 26, 2015","The British Museum has massive and encyclopedic collections from all over the world. One should choose an area of interest and focus on that, or you will experience sensory overload. My favorite is the Southeast Asia collection, which features items from the donations of Mr. PT Brook Sewell. The statues are well preserved and chosen, and demonstrate the extensive nature of the arts influenced by the Hindu religion. There is also a top quality restaurant as well as other cafes. The restaurant features menus from countries for which the museum has an exhibit at the time. It has a fine wine selection.",A magnificent museum but be aware of crowds on weekends.
"September 25, 2015",Have been here during a previous visit to London on a weekday and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. This time we went on a weekend. Egyptian section was completely packed with visitors and the remainder of the museum was crowded. It is a must see attraction but try to avoid weekends.,Great Museum
"August 28, 2015",The British really knew how to steal fabulous stuff from around the world and then preserve it in this museum.,Beautiful but crowded
"August 25, 2015","The museum in itself is beautiful and very interesting. The problem we had with it was that it (of course) is so hugely popular and also there is no entrance fee (only a request for donations), that it is difficult to calmly enjoy it.","I could spend all day in here, and still not see everything it has to offer"
"August 25, 2015","We utilized the Tube and the bus system from Greenwich to get to the British Museum.  We got turned around a bit on the streets, but eventually located the building.  As an American, we are used to having to pay for culture, so when I got to walk through those doors without having to stand in line to pay it was almost freeing but at the same time I thought I was going to be arrested for failure to pay.  I did download a guide from the Musuems website to assist if you only have 1 hour or 3 hours to spend in the Museum.  We spent our time locating the Egyptian exhibits, seeing the Rosetta Stone, the money exhibit, and the African exhibit.  We saw an Easter Island face - which was pretty cool.",Can't top it
"August 23, 2015","One of the greatest museums in the world.  I went here twice on my recent visit. My only regret is how crowded it is, but of course others have discovered it as well.  The Egyptian collection and great statues of Ramesses II and Amenhotep III; the Parthenon sculptures; the Islamic rugs and objects; the finds from British B.C.; all this and more are wonderful.  Just can't recommend it more highly, except perhaps try to find a time when it's not as crowded!",Mesmerised by the collection
"August 19, 2015","To begin, I am not able to comprehend why this place is a 4.5 star and not 5 star. Its like history of the whole wide world placed together for your viewing all at once. This museum cannot be appreciated in 1 day, let alone 2-3 hours which your tour guide will give you. So avoid guided tours which will hustle you and make you run around.Its tiring so do wear comfortable sneakers. Must take is the audio guide.",Endless galleries with intriguing artefacts
"August 16, 2015","This is a must-see in London. So many cool artefacts from all over the world, especially those that were stolen/forcibly taken from other countries during Britain's colonial regime. The museum restaurant was really nice as well, although very pricey.",Expect to be there all day!
"August 11, 2015","This museum offers a broad collection of our history. You will see collections from all around the World.

Close by you will find restaurants, souvenir shops and many more stores for your convenience.",Do your homework! 
"August 9, 2015","We had a wonderful day at the British Museum. We did our homework using the BM website and chose what we wanted to see in advance.  This worked so well because it's easy to be overwhelmed by the colossal amount to see and experience. The museum staff were very helpful with our teens. The Sutton Hoo, Rosetta Stone and the sheer beauty of the place was outstanding. The quality of the displays and lighting needs to be appreciated as you stroll about the enormous displays in this beautiful building. Wear comfortable shoes though.  The food is pretty good too!  ",Overwhelming!
"August 6, 2015",This could well be the best museum in the world! it is huge! And popular. I suggest you go with plans to see something in particular or you may get burned out before you see what interests you. My son was eager to see this museum and he loved it.

I had an egg salad+sundried tomato sandwich, which was fantastic.",Amazing place - be sure to take a free tour!
"November 22, 2015","I hadn't been to the British Museum in almost 40 years, but my return visit did not disappoint!  It is a wonderful way to while away several hours, with plenty of interesting things to entertain anyone and everyone in the family.  The explanations for each of the exhibits are well-written and informative, but the free guided tours on specific rooms/topics (I took the China one) are exceptional - make sure you take at least one! Regardless of what you think about the controversy over the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon, they are very well laid out and fascinating to view and read about (they have a brochure addressing that subject as well).  Don't know how they manage to still make it free to visit, but it would be worth a visit no matter what they charged....",World class and very accessible

It deserves not just 1 visit but several if you have the time and if you are a Londoner, multiple visits year after year - and you'll still find something new to look at in every gallery , + the fantastic special exhibitions mounted several times a year. Try and see 2-3 rooms  with a particular theme or focus at one time or you'll overdose on too many  objects. The cafes and restaurant serve reasonable food and drink so there are places for you to sit and rest in between your visit. Also, the gift shops are great.",Just round the corner
"November 15, 2015","I walked here from the hotel and spent the day with a friend.  There is enough to see for numerous visits and just not enough time in a day to see it all.  The Celtic Exhibition was outstanding, as well as a brief visit to the Parthenon sculptures to seem them again after several years.",Favorite museum anywhere
"November 11, 2015","This is the one destination I make sure I go to no matter how many times I visit London. I never get tired of the most popular exchibits: Rosetta Stone, Egyptian mummies, Pantheon sculptures. But I also find something new every time I visit. The last time I ventured into the clock room right before noon, and was in the room when all the clocks struck noon. It was amazing - dozens of clocks from different eras ringing twelve times.

This time it was so crowded that it was both hard to see anything and hard to get from one place to another, that we left after 20 minutes.  If you come here, I would imagine that arriving when it opens is the time to come.",Rainy day in London

An absolute must-see is the Egyptian mummies in this museum",One of a kind and an absolute must
"August 31, 2015","I absolutely love this museum and is a must do if you are in London. It is free but a donation is asked for when you enter. There is an extra fee for the headset commentary which is well worth it. As soon as you enter, you see a great auditorium from which you enter wings of the museum. The most crowded section is on the left where the Egyptian artifacts are. Absolutely amazing and with the turmoil in Egypt, probably the safest place to view such items. The Rosetta stone is the first object you see and is surounded by everyone. The part that I thoroughly enjoy is actually on the far right side as you enter. It is in a large libary full of smaller items from over the centuries. Literally you could spend hours just in this section. There are tons of books which I could only dream of reading such all the expeditions over the centuries. I would recommend avoiding the Russell Square tube station. It is incredibly deep and the waits for the elevators can be quite long. In the past we had a harder time finding the museum as well. There is a large and wonderrful gift shop in the central atrium. Another one as you enter on the right that has many jewelry options. You can easily spend a small forture there. There is no limitation of taking picture which was nice. No ideal about selfie sticks though. So many more places are banning them. Will continue to visit here everytime we go. Enjoy.",THE museum to visit in London
"August 31, 2015","In a city full of great museums, which one to visit?  Definitely the British Museum.  Park your reservations about how the British acquired artifacts in the 18/19th century at the door and enjoy the exhibits.  The artifacts from the ancient empires are amazing, and there are free 30/45min guided tours in different sections of the museum throughout the day - just ask the info desk.  The Assyrian lions, the Egyptian reliefs, Greek marbles, Aztec jade masks, Rosetta stone, even an Ivory (Lewis) chess set ...just to name a few of amazing things to see.  You can spend a whole week in here!Like most London museums, it is Free entry.  It has 2 entrances - on Great Russell St and Montague Place.  A host of buses will drop you close to the Museum, or any of the tubes (Tottenham court rd, Holborn, Goodge St or Russell Square)Wear comfortable shoes as you are likely to be on your feet for alot longer than planned given all the amazing exhibits.  When you are tired and warn out - head to Russell square for some good cafes & food as it is expensive & average food in and around the museum.",History buffs paradise
"August 29, 2015","All of the museums in London are spectacular. In fact, I would be very hard-pressed to pick a favorite one, but this might be it. The stone antiquities are stunning, but there is so much more to see here. Plan at least half a day, longer if you can. You will not be disappointed.",Great Museum
"August 28, 2015",The British really knew how to steal fabulous stuff from around the world and then preserve it in this museum.,Beautiful but crowded
"August 25, 2015","The museum in itself is beautiful and very interesting. The problem we had with it was that it (of course) is so hugely popular and also there is no entrance fee (only a request for donations), that it is difficult to calmly enjoy it.","I could spend all day in here, and still not see everything it has to offer"
"August 25, 2015","We utilized the Tube and the bus system from Greenwich to get to the British Museum.  We got turned around a bit on the streets, but eventually located the building.  As an American, we are used to having to pay for culture, so when I got to walk through those doors without having to stand in line to pay it was almost freeing but at the same time I thought I was going to be arrested for failure to pay.  I did download a guide from the Musuems website to assist if you only have 1 hour or 3 hours to spend in the Museum.  We spent our time locating the Egyptian exhibits, seeing the Rosetta Stone, the money exhibit, and the African exhibit.  We saw an Easter Island face - which was pretty cool.",Inarguably the best museum collection.
"July 20, 2015","One of the best museum collections globally. Has exhibitions to satisfy the taste of every visitor. Egyptian, Greek and Mid-East collections are the best. They regularly organise special exhibitions in collaboration with other leading museums, the ones I visited include Vikings, Colombian Gold and Mummies. The great court is huge and is an attraction in itself. Early morning and evenings are the best times to visit as tourist numbers are small.  Having visited this place over 30 times I would recommend an average trip duration of 2-3 hours. The collection is huge so don't wander about the place because you cannot finish the whole of it in one go, pick up a free map provided and aim to see the highlighted artifacts or a section that interests you.",Loved it 
"July 19, 2015","We all loved it, kids enjoyed it, spent a couple of hours there... We loved the Ancient Egypt Section where they saw the mummies, it was crowded though, we didn't have time to look closely at everything. There is also a cafe inside, and a gift and souvenir shop, which was mostly lovely and good stuff except for some of the items that were cheaply made, especially the Indian bracelets and the Indian sparkly pens which our daughter chose, they broke the same day, we couldn't return them as we were traveling the next day. Outside the museum the kids enjoyed chasing pigeons. ",Gives a good scope of the British Empire
"July 14, 2015",Extensive collections of all kinds of things from all kinds of places.Makes you realize that England held sway over much of the globe.,Best museum ever
"July 14, 2015",It's free so perfect on a budgetEngland has ownd most of the world in her glory days so what is better den to show some of the world's history ;-) ,Fun (and *mostly* FREE!) for the WHOLE Family
"July 14, 2015","This is one of the best museums in the entire world.  It's free.  It's manageable.  It has exhibits that will interest the whole family.  It's in a great area and is easily accessible by public transit.  It is also within walking distance of great restaurants.  There isn't much in the way of great food at this museum, but they do sell refreshments. Additionally, it's important to know that while the museum is free, not all of the exhibits are included.  The featured exhibit (found in the center of the rotunda at the main entrance of the museum does have a fee and requires a reservation.  Popular exhibits will sell out quickly, so either plan ahead, or talk to your hotel concierge (sometimes they purchase a block of tickets and sell them to hotel guests at a premium.... consider this option only if you are absolutely desperate to see the exhibit).  But it is by no means necessary to buy entry into the featured exhibit... there is plenty to see with out it.  None of the major artifacts require tickets (the Rosetta stone, the mummies, etc.), so don't feel bad if you can't or don't want to get tickets.  Plan to spend at least 2-3 hours in the museum in order to hit all the highlights, but you really could spend all day there.",I lost track of time....Excellent day
"July 12, 2015",Where to start. Something for everyone.This museum has SO much and covers every segment of history.

But once again now these 2 ancient countries are proving to the world that they are really not worthy of governing their own people well and to properly safe guard these treasures.The 2 exhibits that took my eye were the 1536 Hans Holbein the Younger's portrait of Anne Boleyn and  the 1900 -1600 BC bronze age Mould Gold Cape from North Wales.Brian, from Perth.

"June 30, 2015","I visited the British Museum on a recent trip to London.  The Museum is very large and it is not always easy to navigate, but the amount and importance of artifacts is extremely impressive.  The Museum is well-labeled and maps are easily accessible, but it is massive.  The Elgin Marbles and the Rosetta Stone are some of the highlights, but there are so many important and interesting items this is a museum one should not miss.  Even for people who are not museum fans it is worth a visit, but I would not attempt to see the entire thing.  Another great feature is that the museum is free of charge.  I would recommend a visit to the British Museum.",All the World's Treasures
"June 4, 2015","Treasures such as the Rosseta Stone and Mummies from Egypt, the Parthenon Marbles from Greece (which should of course be returned to the Acropolis Museum), treasures from China, Iran and the list goes on.I often walk through the Museum corridors as I pass by - it is free and on a wet London day it beats waling in the rain.One of the best museums in London.",Essential to visit but some questions raised.
"May 26, 2015","I brought a tour group of US college students to visit the British Museum on a study abroad on the History of the African Diaspora. Of course, the museum provided an unprecedented opportunity to view artifacts from the Egyptian, Assyrian, Hellenic, African, and Asian worlds, including most notably the Benin Bronzes, the Parthenon frieze and sculptures, and the Rosetta Stone. However, my students raised questions fundamental to the museum in terms of the relationship of British colonialism to the collection as well as the continued rights of the museum to possess and display these artifacts. In turn, the students raised questions about the relationship between the Africa gallery to the other galleries. First, Egypt was disconnected from Africa implying that Egypt is not part if an ""African"" cultural and historical lineage. Africa was also consigned to a separate basement floor while Egypt was positioned in the center of the ground floor with a seemingly logical progression to the Assyrian and Hellenic galleries, suggesting an influence and interconnection in world historical development. In contrast, Africa was presented rather statically and ahistorically without close attention to regional and temporal transformations or global contributions.",British museum sleepover 
"May 24, 2015","The British museum run sleepovers for their ""young friends"" members throughout the year. We have just arrived back from the ""indigenous Australia"" sleepover which is themed around the temp exhibition of the same name. Tbh I wasn't quick enough to jump on the tickets for the ""night at the museum"" themed sleepovers but I don't regret it at all. In fact it was a better option as we always head for the Egyptian galleries when we visit, whereas this time we took away and experience of something we weren't so familiar with. Have previously slept over at another well known museum in London and found that the British museum sleepover far exceeds the experience we had previously, mainly due to the organisation, which is seamless. You arrive for 6 and can walk straight in with your booking form- you then queue outside the Assyrian galleries which will be your sleeping area. At checkin you are assigned a colour group and shown to your groups designated area to set up. At 7 pm you head off for a talk and then into your first two activities. You leave your snack food in a bag labelled with your group name at the end of your beds and this is laid out in colour groups on the eating benches for snack time at 9pm where they give you coffee to keep us adults going before the final two activities. Ends at 23.30 and lights out at midnight. What I especially liked was the fact the activities are held in galleries we wouldn't normally go in- and you have a nice walk through others on your way to the activities. In the morning you get breakfast, to go round the exhibition and they open the shop at 8am to get any souvenirs. Can't praise the staff highly enough for their friendly approachable manner and always being available for questions. The exhibition really came to life for the children after the activities the night before.Highly recommend you do this- very special. ",The world is here

"May 10, 2015",Unbelievable collection of artifacts from all over the world.  Lots of great history and exploration all under one roof.  Was there for only 3 hours and could have spent days in there as the collections are that extensive.  A must if you travel to London.  ,The perfect museum
"May 10, 2015","I love the British Museum. It has amazingly wonderful and diverse exhibits so you can see ancient Egyptian ruins the same day as Italian Renaissance Paintings. The museum is free which makes it possible to return multiple times which I personally think is the best way to the museum as it is so large. We visited for a few hours and then returned a couple days later to see most of the rest of the museum; had we done it all on one day we, well, we couldn't have seen nearly as much. Even after 6 or 7 hours we did not see even close to everything.",Please STOP TOUCHING the art & artifacts!
"May 6, 2015",This is a wonderful museum with a very interesting permanent collection (and temporary exhibitions as well). But there is one big problem with it - there are A LOT of people touching the ancient artifacts. I even saw a woman put her small child on top of a 3000 year old statue so that she could take a picture - THIS IS NOT DISNEYLAND! The British Museum should hire more staff to keep an eye on things.,Step Through Time
"May 3, 2015","A trip to London is not complete unless we visit the British Museum!  We are especially drawn to the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles and the Egyptian artifacts. We make it a point to visit a new section of the museum every time we are there.",I wonder were is England's history

"February 4, 2015","The British museum is without doubt the best museum I have ever visited. It is packed with interesting pices. The entrence is free so there is really no reason not to visit. I think you can easely spend a day or even more in the gigantic building if you want to see everything. I myself spent about 3 hours walking around and saw some amazing pices.My highest recomendations of must see pices inside is: the roseeta stone, remains of the mausuleum of Hallikarnasos, the whole egypt section with mummies and for a swede as myself I found the vikibg area very special. ",Free of charge. Full of emotions.

"January 27, 2015","I am a regular visit to this museum and have been coming here for at least three decades. There is such a variety of artifacts to see, including some of the most famous artifacts in the world. There is always something new to see. I find it good to focus on one area each time I visit. The Egyptian sections are incredible and my favourite. Of course, it is debatable how much should actually be there, rather than I the country it was found, but I'm not here to review that. A fantastic museum as it stands! ",Stil cannot believe no entrance fees
"January 10, 2015","Having visited a couple of museums round the world, it is still unthinkable that this museum is free. One may conclude that it's because there's nothing to see but you will be surprised that the collection is awesome. One should not miss the Roman exhibits, especially The Parthenon ruins collection which apparently is just as spectacular as the exhibits back in Rome.",Just Go - Tips For Your Visit
"January 2, 2015","Hard to add much of additional value that hasn't already been said in the reviews below.  So here are some very quick tips 'when you go' (not IF).- its free so go early, plan on being there at opening or as soon after as you can, avoid the afternoon if possible- research what you want to see and plan your visit accordingly- see the important things as early in your visit as practical- see the Rosetta Stone amongst the many other things, you'll regret it after if you don't- get a guide book, audio guide or real person guide to get the most out of your visit- kids love the mummies- plan to be there for 3-4 hours, take your time and learn something, don't just tick the box- and stay relaxed and enjoy the experience",Rosetta Stone
"December 16, 2014","My mission was to see the Rosetta Stone.  I took the time afterward to take a short tour of the museum's Greek and Assyrian areas (tight schedule).  My verdict....MAGNIFICENT !!.  The British Museum provides a most unique collection of cultural artifacts from around the world all in one place.  A must for the tourist, the historian, the researcher and the just plain citizen of the world.  AND IT'S MOSTLY FREE !!",Impressive!
"November 26, 2014","Astonishing collections from Ancient Egypt, many other exhibition halls. It is a trully tresure of the world's civilisation !",One of the World's Finest
"November 11, 2014","The British Museum is truly one of the world's finest museums of antiquities. Home of the actual Rosetta Stone as well as beautiful Assyrian, Egyptian and Asian scuptures, tombs and jewelry","The space, the art, the ambience"
"October 14, 2014","It is all here, art from several ancient cultures -- Egyptian, Iranian, Roman, Etruscan, etc displayed beautifully with clearly written explanatory posters all over the place.  Of particular note was the full-room display on the history of money, and of course, the Rosetta Stone, stones from the Parthenon, and their other ""greatest hits.""  Exhibits are well labeled (though only in English), rooms are numbered clearly so that you can trace your route on the map through the huge space, guards and other staff are omnipresent and eager to answer questions.  We didn't try the restaurant but the cafe in the grand indoor courtyard was spacious and offered the usual lunch and snack options.  Free tours are scheduled regularly throughout the day.  We spend 4 hours there and felt that this was enough for one visit.","Crowded, warm, overwhelming number of items on display. Needs at least a day."
"August 6, 2014","There were 3 floors in the British Museum, but the top floor with the displays from Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia appealed to me the most even though I had mainly come to see the Elgin marbles on the first floor. The Ancient Egypt galleries were quite confined with 2 main pathways to look at display cases along the walls and in the center of the room. I found this floor the most crowded and very warm, but also the most rewarding in terms of being fascinated with the displays of numerous mummies and coffins. The information about the Egyptians' belief in life after death was excellent. The Ancient Egypt display was continued on the first floor with columns and sculptures of pharaohs. The Assyrian/Mesopotamia Civilization display also took up my visiting time on the third floor with its variety of displays showing the location, warfare, and way of life. On the next floor down, I thought that the displays of early Britain were not as well done as those in the London Museum. Perhaps by this time I was sensory overloaded having looked at too may displays of jewelry and rusted spearheads. All of the items in the display cases were identified, and information about the time period appeared on the walls. It certainly was educational and, indeed, the school group of well-behaved young children I followed in one room (I was there in June) seemed to be enjoying their ""Treasure Hunt"" by filling out a worksheet after looking at objects in display cases. I saved some energy for looking at the Parthenon friezes on the first floor. They were not in perfect condition with heads broken off, missing arms and legs, or corners of blocks missing. Yet I still enjoyed the artistry. What I learned from the information boards surrounding the frieze was that this frieze tells a story of bringing an offering to the Temple, but the ceremony breaks out into a brawl when the soldiers instead try to abduct the Greek women in the crowd. Although the museum was busy, the crowds really didn't affect my ability to see the information in the display cases. We ate lunch on the main floor ""court yard"". We liked the cafeteria style service with a good selection of lunch foods as it was a very quick way to grab some food. A big bowl of soup and a thick chunk of bread was 5GBP and large scones studded with raisins were 2.50 GBP, but salads, hot dishes and desserts were also available. We printed out a map of the floor layouts to be familiar with what could be seen on each floor and used that to help us navigate the displays. I am glad we allowed ourselves all day for this visit as there was so much to see and take it. We came away quite exhausted and not really wanting to see another museum or gallery that day.",An enlightened walk through history
"August 5, 2014","The entrance to the museum is remarkable. Vast is an understatement! We arrived on a Friday afternoon with a mission to see the exhibits from Athens, Greece, specifically the Elgin Marbles and the Parthenon Sculptures. We were not disappointed!  We also saw the Rosetta Stone which words can't describe, and just looking at it is downright mind boggling. Dedicate plenty of time and take it all in.  We only had a couple of days in London and would loved to have planned more time to explore everything this museum has to offer. Everything was highly informative and interesting. We also visited the gallery with clocks and watches and how they work. It was fascinating to see! Take advantage of the later closing time on Friday evenings. We visited the museum for a few hours on a Friday afternoon and then left to have an early dinner nearby to relax.  Then we returned and stayed until the museum closed at 8:30. Also, the crowds seemed to thin a bit later in the day. This museum has something for everyone, even if you don't consider yourself to be the museum type. Go and be amazed at what there is here to see.",The reason to forgive the British looting of its former colonies
"July 23, 2014","I've always enjoyed my visits to the British Museum ever since my first-ever London visit of March 1996. And my latest visit, for June and July 2014, only strengthened my positive impressions! I have made four visits to the museum and I still am far from done.- Location -The British Museum is located on Great Russell Street, within easy walk of several Tube stations: Holborn, Russell Square, Goodge Street, and Tottenham Court Road.- Admissions -As is usual for most of the excellent national museums in London and the UK, it's free, though a £4 (or equivalent amounts in Euro, US dollars, or another currency) donation is suggested. Another £1 if I want a map of the museum.- Highlights -Many of the British Museum's exhibits are the result of British colonial occupation of the Near East and other parts of the world. In particular, the Egyptian and Assyrian collections are the most extensive in the world outside the countries of origin.The Egyptian collections consist of many old statues and fragments, spanning the many different dynasties and eras that made up 3,000 years of Ancient Egypt. Although the Rosetta Stone, which is written in hieroglyphics, a more modern Egyptian script, and Greek (and allowed the deciphering of hieroglyphics), is the most popular exhibit in the Egyptian section (and always mobbed by crowds), my favorite instead would have to be a bronze statue of a seated cat, portraying Goddess Bastet, not too far away from the Rosetta Stone. The upstairs exhibition halls have even more Egyptian artifacts, including many mummies of humans, cats, and other living things.The Assyrian collections are not as extensive as the Egyptian ones, but still awesome, with the iconic winged Pegasus-like guardians from city gates built into the modern museum structure.The Greek collection is also excellent. The highlights include the Nereid Monument, built in the 380s BC in today's southwestern Turkey, as well as the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon.Elsewhere in the museum, the Chinese and Southeast Asian artifacts are also very well covered, in a long exhibit hall toward the back (bordered by an awesome courtyard beyond it), with special emphasis on Buddhism, Hinduism, and other spiritualities of the regions involved; longtime British presence in India, parts of Southeast Asia, and Hong Kong, helped with the breadth and depth of the collections. Further upstairs, more Asian art awaits in the form of Japanese and Korean exhibits, sponsored by major corporations of the respective countries.Of course, there are artifacts covering the closer parts of the world, like Europe and the British Isles themselves. The standout of the British exhibits is the Lindow Man, who had lived around the time of Jesus, and who had been killed (possibly in a ritual) and thrown into a peat bog. He was discovered in 1984 and has been preserved ever since in his mummified state.Although there are some excellent exhibits dedicated to the Americas, Africa, and the Muslim world, I was not able to spend time with those exhibits this particular time around.- The Great Court -Perhaps the biggest change to the British Museum since my first 1996 visit would be the Great Court, formerly an open courtyard that was enclosed in 2000 under diffused glass ceiling. This area hosts some seating/relaxation areas, cafes, souvenir shops, and more.On a hot summer day, however, it more or less becomes a very muggy greenhouse.- Afterthoughts -Just hitting the ""star exhibits"" such as the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles can easily eat up a few hours at this excellent museum. And to appreciate the breadth and depth of the collection, by lingering in each cultural section long enough to understand the context of the exhibits and the history of the region concerned, can easily take multiple visits. Given the free admissions and easy accessibility, it is a good idea to visit the British Museum several times over multiple visits to London, if possible.Also I was less than thrilled with loud-mouthed Chinese tour groups (a fact of life at any major tourist destination in the world these days), in the Chinese (!) section. Honestly I don't get the point of spending a fortune to travel all the way from China to England, only to see more Chinese art, when there are better examples of Chinese art and culture back home, but that's me. Even without the tour groups (Chinese or otherwise), it does get crowded at all times of the day, so plan accordingly.In any case this museum is truly one of a kind, and a must-see on any London itinerary. I will surely be back again soon.",Disgusting toilets
"July 12, 2014",I'm usually one to not post negative unless really bad. This may sound petty but it ruined our visit. I have only seen and smelt worse on trains in India. There really is no excuse for poorly attended facilities in a first world country and a tourist destination such as London. ,"Ancient Assyrian, Egyptian, Greek and Italian galleries in 3 hours"
"June 25, 2014","We recently visited the British Museum, choosing to concentrate our efforts on the Ancient Assyrian, Egyptian, Greek and Italian galleries only.  By focusing on targeted areas within the museum we were able to enjoy a comprehensive visit, while conserving our energy by not moving around from one end of the museum to the other to see certain museum highlights. Starting with the Ancient Egyptians Gallery rooms as the museum opened at 10am, we were able to see the Rosetta Stone (196 BC), Colossal bust of Ramesses II (1250 BC) and other ancient Egyptian treasures before moving onward to the Assyrian rooms, highlighted by the incredibly detailed Lion Hunt Panels (645 – 635 BC). Onward into the Greek rooms, where you can see the the Parthenon and Elgin's Marbles (447–438 BC).  A nice collection of ancient Roman sculptures, potteries, wares and very nice mosaics (1450 BC – AD 500) were enjoyed along with a visit to the upstairs room 61-63 where you can see the Tomb-chapel of Nebamun (1400 – 1300 BC) and the collection of Egyptian mummies and sarcophagi (circa 2686 BC – AD 395) are found.  By this time, we had spent just over 3 hours in the museum and were ready to be on our way for lunch.  In the end, we found that concentrating our efforts on a smaller section of the museum had many advantages.  We were able to visit some of the very best of the British Museum and spend plenty of time, comprehensively looking over most of the collection in these galleries and rooms.   We also didn't feel as tired, not having to walk extensively around the museum in purpose of specific highlight scattered throughout. Regardless of how you decide to visit the museum, we highly recommend spending a bit of time getting to know about the museum prior to your visit.  This will greatly enhance your experience when you are there.  To help in this regard, you can have a look at our previous review which provides 'Tips on How to Visit' the British Museum.",Fantastic exhibit ruined by overcrowding and poor organization
"June 12, 2014","I have seen many Viking museums and exhibits and this was had the potential to be one of the best, except for the fact that I couldn't see any of it. Although this was timed admittance it was way over sold so the crowding was terrible. There were far too many people trying to read tiny writing located at the bottom of each case. This would have been so much better  if the print was larger and there had been some direction given to those who were tying to view the exhibit. Also too many backpacks taking up space. There was also one woman with a huge backpack leaning over the exhibits while chowing down on her smelly and messy sandwich !  Really !  Isn't that why they were checking my small purse ?save your money. Don't bother with this exhibit",Viking Exhibition
"May 27, 2014","Just to clarify. My comments are for the Viking exhibition only.  Please avoid, it's not worth the time, money and effort. Where do I start? First of all it's nearly impossible to get the overpriced ticket. The exhibition is not being held in the usual space in the central part of the building, so you have to go round the whole area through the crowds before you figure out where to go. Once you are in you see people's backs which is normal for a blockbuster exhibition.   However, the worst thing is the exhibition itself.  There is very little to see.  I was done in 30 minutes.  Do yourself a favour and book a holiday to Scandinavia for the real thing.",Too crowded
"May 23, 2014","Visited the Viking exhibition today after booking a slot online several weeks ago and coming to London especially to see it.   We were very disappointed as there were so many people we could not see the displays very well.  When we entered the exhibition it was so crowded we were left confused as to where to start or where to go.  We felt oppressed by the greyness, the lack of direction and the number of people.   When a space in front of a display did become available we found others sometimes pushed in front of us.  We also felt the displays we did see were a little bland. Based on our experience and the cost (over £40.00 for three) I would definitely NOT recommend this as a day out.",Viking Exhibition
"May 15, 2014","What a huge disappointment this exhibition was. So crowded, poorly labelled, lack of content. There was no flow, the cases were surrounded by people listening to their audio guides oblivious to everyone else. It was almost impossible to read the case labels. The artefacts were not individually labelled. The timed entry was meaningless. Do not waste your money. ",Viking Exhibition
"April 22, 2014","If you are thinking of going do a little research first and it will be much more enlightening - see if you can find the Culture Show's documentary by Andrew Graham-Dixon, which is a fab programme on it's own!  The exhibition is in the new exhibition centre, more spacious than the old Reading Room but still, in my opinion, badly laid out.  Instead of flat on display cases they should try angled ones so more people can see the items.  Although it is a ticketed exhibition there were too many people and those listening to the audio guide were particularly annoying, standing in front of a display for up to 5 minutes...take a step back people and let others see!  Putting all this to one side, the exhibition itself is wonderful.  There are some amazing things to see and you learn so much about the people of the northern countries (it isn't really correct to call them all ""Vikings""!!)Go if you can and enjoy and learn - the British Museum at its best.",VIKING RAID
"March 17, 2014","There were some amazing objects to see at this exhibition if you had the perseverance to wait to get a space near the cabinets and spend most of your time invading other people's personal space or them invading yours.  Many of the objects were small coins etc. How could so many people enjoy them at once?MAIN PROBLEM:    Far too crowded....if you let too many in at once this is bound to happen.  The assistant at the door advised us to ""go past the first couple of rooms and then come back""....luckily we didn't do this as it would have been impossible to return to the first room against the flow of humanity pouring in.DISPLAY ISSUES:   Why were the information panels so low down on the cabinets forcing viewers to get up to close and blocking the view for those behind?    Did the designer of the exhibition expect small numbers ??  The info panels should have been higher or perhaps repeated on the side of the cabinets.  Many of the exhibits could have been more at eye level.Why so few photo panels extending the information available.Has the designer/curator tried to see the exhibition since he set it up....maybe he could learn a few things about displaying small objects and the relevant information.   For one thing why weren't the objects numbered so that the relevant pieces if information were easily found?SORRY BM.

"March 17, 2014","This exhibition could have been made for me and my daughter. This was a birthday surprise for her and much anticipated. I had booked my time slot and received an email to remind me not to miss it etc. This made me think that visitors would be staggered - if they were it made no difference. Over-crowded - constant bottle necks of people listening to headphones. Bare minimum info on the exhibits - a heap of cash in a cabinet could have been worth tuppence halfpenny for all I know. Staff bossy and not user friendly. Presentation seemed dated in style. Cannot tell you how disappointing this was, and I really like the British Museum. Definitely did not live up to all the hype. Go by all means but keep your expectations low.",Viking exhibition scrum
"March 16, 2014","This is the third recent exhibition we have been to at the British Museum but it could be the last. The first problem was the shear number of people being admitted at one time. This was compounded by the people standing in front of the exhibits listening to the audio guides. This continued for the first half of the visit, the crowds thinned out towards the end. By that time my wife had given up and had gone to find a seat. The exhibits themselves did not compare with the terracotta warriors or Pompeii.  It seemed that the museums greed in maximising visitor numbers spoilt what should have been an interesting visit and turned it into a scrum.",Vikings
"March 16, 2014",Deep down this exhibition was shallow. BM visitors can handle more information than was provided. The most challenging aspect was coping with the large number of visitors the museum tried to squeeze through the doors. I expected better.,Vikings at the BM
"March 15, 2014","The British Museum is a wonderful treasure and exhibitions from Tutankhamun to Pompeii stay positively in my mind. But the Vikings, which promised so much was spoiled, as all previous reviewers here have said, by overcrowding. Where small and intricately beautiful pieces of jewellery deserve close examination it was either practically impossible to see or one was jammed by the slowly shuffling crowd in the gap between exhibits. The entrance was planned so badly that there seemed to be two diverging routes but no way to view the alternative path. The remains of the boat are also disappointing, with far more new metal skeleton than genuine timber.I agree with previous reviewers that the BM has tried to maximise its income by allowing too many people in to the timed session and in so doing has spoiled the experience for us all. A great shame, so I shall be watching the television programme about the show tonight with interest to see what I have surely missed.I think I will then start planning a return trip to The Viking Ship Museum at Bygdøy, Oslo (entrance fee £3 !)",Vikings Awful
"March 15, 2014","The worst of a series of increasingly expensive  (£17.50), crowded and sparse exhibitions.  The Vikings has been hyped beyond it's value.   Every 10 minutes another 25 people were admitted to the gallery,  where we stood for another 20 minutes before trying to see a 2inch brooch, along with another dozen people.  Most of the exhibits were coins.  Just try to examine 20  10P coins with elbows gouging into your ribs, school parties scrabbling around with their note sheets. and the temperature/humidity reaching tropical levels.    We will not be attending any more BM exhibitions until these problems have been solved.",Allow at least 2 hours for the Vikings
"March 15, 2014","Our tickets were for the last slot on 14 March (7pm) and the entrance area to the exhibition was extremely crowded at that time.  We chose to be patient and let the crowd clear and then worked our way around the exhibition which was very good.  Unfortunately, this tactic meant that we were unable to finish the exhibition before we were uncermoniously thrown out at 8:30.  I think that the BM should allow 2 hours from last entry, especially given the overcrowding issues which make progress slow.  The person who took responsibility for removing the last reluctant visitors from the exhibition was unnecessarily rude which reflects badly on the BM.",Viking Exhibition - Great if you're not in a hurry.
"March 14, 2014","Brilliant exhibition, but overcrowded. 20 minute slots would have made it better. No it's not a cheap exhibition, but the exhibits are priceless, and the quality of the displays and security would not come cheap. The descriptions against each exhibit were small and some were difficult to read (especially if you had several people between you and the exhibit). They could have been bigger and higher. One reviewer was disappointed that the ship was just a few planks of wood : to please 'non-archaeologically-minded people it would have been good to have a scale model (maybe a fifth or sixth of real size). Despite the crowds, I was in no hurry, waited for the people to move on, and took around 3 hours to see everything. The price for 3 hours entertainment is not so expensive.",Viking Exhibition a Frustrating Experience
"March 14, 2014","To walk into an exhibition - to which you've travelled a long way (in our case from Dorset), and paid to see, and looked forward to seeing - and find that you can hardly get in the room for the crowds, is extremely disappointing and anger-inducing.  It seemed that the British Museum were being far too greedy.  To then find that you can hardly see the exhibits because you are craning your neck or simply completely blocked from viewing them, and that you cannot read the information about them because someone is leaning over to shadow them or simply blocking them completely, is even more frustrating.  Even when we did get to read the info, the descriptions of what was on show were very basic and simplified, so one didn't find out much about them anyway.  It was like the BBC dumbing it down.  And as for the writings on the walls - some of these were barely legible in the shadows because they were in dark script, and when they were readable their sources weren't listed.  One verse looked to be genuine poetry but one couldn't be sure.  There was no mention of the literature surrounding the Viking era; and as an example, even when the Battle of Maldon was mentioned, there was no reference to the Old English poem from which we glean our knowledge.  The curator should be sacked and so should the interior designer.  In all, this exhibition doesn't deserve even a glance.",Viking Crush
"March 14, 2014","What is the point of selling advanced fixed time entry slots to so many people at once? Groups of people were just milling about in the entrance, so sharp elbows were needed just to get in. Everyone using one of the electronic guides (which the Museum charges extra for) stands blocking each exhibit while they listen, groups just stand around chatting and pushchairs - why are they allowed? In fact, the show was so crowded when I went yesterday (Thursday) at 1pm I got out as fast as I could. I hate being so hemmed in and couldn't see a thing anyhow, so gave up. I am only glad I have an Art Pass and didn't have to pay the full price. I love the British Museum and I go several times a year, but it is now so busy now the whole visit is too much of an effort I am not sure I will go again for a while.",Turning back the hands of time ... 2 million years back
"February 2, 2023","There are 8 million works in the Museum systems collection; it represents the history of human culture, or at least its objects and antiquities.  The exterior is beautiful Greek Revival architecture and the interior Reading Room is a huge food court with a rotunda of glass in the ceiling.  The museum occupies 990,000 square feet.  There are 7 levels to the museum.Seven categories of geographical locations divide the areas of exhibits: Africa, Americas, Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and Rome, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.  Additionally, there is a category called ""Themes"" which is further divided into 7 topics.  The Museum is open at 10 a.m. and stays open until 5 p.m. (later on Fridays).  It is free, get there plenty early as it really gets crowded quickly.Less than 1% of its artifacts are on display (about 50,000 items).It was said that the British Empire was so vast that the sun never set on it, as the sun would always be shining somewhere in it.  One can imagine that the British were everywhere and in no small part were involved in the aspect of collecting.Some personal favorites were the depiction of the double-headed eagle which represented the Holy Roman Empire (not from the Russian Romanoff's as I would have imagined), a soldier pulling the wing off Cupid (it is a political anti-Medici statement), the dying Lioness (so painful to see her riddled with arrows while she drags her body), the face of the fisherman (how much uglier could he possibly get?), the Battle of Adua (Ethiopian queen is holding a huge revolver!) and the beauty of Ganymede (object of Zeus' affections).But there was so much more.  Can't wait to get the chance to come back.  Could spend a week here!  It was so helpful to have little write-ups next to the displays so we could appreciate the item in context.",Amazin
"December 31, 2022","Great museum with incredible displays.  One could spend days here.  Organization was a little confusing.  Best to come with a game plan if possible.  Also, crowds were ferocious.",Nice

"November 24, 2022",Visit to their Hieroglyphs Exhibition which explains how their were translated using the Rosetta Stone and other objects. Wonderfully done with a great collection of Egyptian artefacts from around the world,Very instructive and interesting
"November 21, 2022",We saw evidence of the turbulent and diverse past of the entire world in one place. We want to go back because there is so much more to see.,Visited only a tiny portion
"September 28, 2022","We planned to see the Rosetta Stone and some of the Egyptian exhibit, that was overwhelming in itself.  This museum is huge and houses more treasures that imaginable.  ",Very good
"July 17, 2022",One of the best that I have ever visited and it a good area too which is easy to get to be transportation. We will be back when we return to London one day,Great Museum
"July 15, 2022",We saw the long line of people waiting to get in before it opened - so we walked around for about an hour or so and came back and then no line.  Great museum - terrific snack and gift shop.,Massive and Massively Amazing
"July 11, 2022","I wish I could’ve returned back to the British Museum after my first visit on my second day touring London. This is an outstanding facility befitting one of the classiest, most beloved cities on the globe. The grand atrium, with its stunning glass-paned ceiling, is bright and welcoming, despite the throngs of fellow tourists during the unprecedentedly-busy summer season. From this atrium, one can access every other part of the museum, making navigation relatively confusion-free. I encourage everyone to take their time at each exhibit, reading the plaques and learning from this incredible collection of art and history.Contrasted with the National Gallery, which I kind of consider the “sister” to the British Museum in a way, this museum offers ample dining/snack options at affordable prices, as well as with ample seating areas. Moreover, the restrooms and other public facilities are very clean. And did I mention that it’s free here too?!There’s not enough time to list all the wonderful attributes of this top-notch London icon. I recommend a visit ASAP!",Touble Security
"June 21, 2012","Nice place with a lot of wonderful things to see. However,  security is a joke. No one to check anything coming in or going out.  My wife and I were having lunch, purse by her feet and it was taken.  Passports, credit cards, money, rail passes driver's licenses, all gone.  There was CCTV which the police reviewed but of the poor quality the police could not ID the ones who took her purse and we were told the CCTV could not be used in their courts. We saw other sites and museums that had much better security and warning signs posted.  They were no warning signs at the British Museum. This type of thing is happening all over London the police told us and they expect it to increase do to the OlympicsMy advice is to only carry what little you need.  Be aware there are scams, be aware of your surrounding at all times while in London, especially in crowded places, such as the British Museum",Overwhelming!
"June 15, 2012",Have a plan when you visit this museum.  There is so much to see!,Plan on spending three very worthwhile hours
"June 13, 2012","One of the better museums across Europe, the British Museum focuses mostly on Egyptian, Greek, and Roman archaeological artifacts from around 500 BC to 1000 AC. While it is not the same in content or architectural design as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Louvre in Paris, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, or the Museo del Prado in Madrid, it is comparable in the quality and content of its exhibits so as to be considered world-class. It also is free to visit, and contrary to some other ""free"" museums in London, such as the various Tate Galleries, this one truly offers mostly all of its exhibits for free. The hours are somewhat limiting, as is the case for most attractions in London. When visiting in June of 2012, the museum was only open until 17:30, except Fridays when it closed at 20:30. Some notes:- Do visit the upper levels toward the rear of the building. They are listed as levels 1 and 2 but they feel more like levels 3 and 4 if you are using the stairs. There are elevators but they are slow and small. These upper levels contain some wonderful Asian collections, mostly from Japan and China.- Do not eat here. There is one cafe somewhat separated from the hustle and bustle of the museum at the end of one of the wings. There is another in the main rotunda. Both serve what could only be considered food by those who are truly starving. There is also a restaurant on the upper level (go up the stairs in the main rotunda). We did not try it, but the menu was quite limited.- There seems to be enough space to walk around and not feel congested. Even though the museum is free, there are no hoards of people as one might expect at all times. Photography and videography (amateur) are allowed. There is no bag inspection (security may not be as needed or perhaps they only stop people with certain size bags). - Do not miss the Rosetta Stone, the Statue of Ramesses, the Minoan Bull Leaper, and the Parthenon sculptures (which likely the Greek government would like to have returned).Do allow time to see the museum with care. It took us about three hours just to walk through all the exhibits without dedicating too much time to each, which included about 20 minutes in one of the aforementioned and forgettable cafes.",Museum for kids
"May 28, 2012","If you are travelling with your kids, ask for the kids packages. They are great, they need to look for clues depending on the section of the museum you choose. ",Toilets a disgrace
"February 21, 2012","The museum was brilliant and the sandwiches in the Court Cafe were amongst the best pre-packed sandwiches I have ever had. But, oh ! the toilets were a disgrace. Most of them were blocked and clearly had not been cleaned for a considerable time. The museum is a magnet for overseas visitors, I dread to think what sort of impression it leaves with them to take home.",Best in the World
"January 9, 2012","Because of the rampant colonialism experienced by Britain in the 19th and 20th centuries, they were able to amass the most impressive collection of Eygyptian artifacts in the world. Now that the reading room is completed, it is an un-forgettable expereince to wander through a space used by Twain, Emerson and others. What makes it the best? Its free!",Booty
"December 19, 2011","The reason I give this museum two star is not because the museum is bad, it is because most of the stuff in this museum are not belong to Britain. I feel weird when I saw Egyptian,Chinese and Greek artifacts in a country that are not belong to them. This is just my personal opinion.",Boring
"December 5, 2011",Enjoyed the performers outside more than the displays inside.,"Great collection... best of all, it's free!"
"November 20, 2011","Great collection of sculpture and other objects from human antiquity. We especially liked the Rosetta stone, the Parthenon marbles (which we had been looking forward to it since our earlier visit to Athens), the statues of Egyptian pharaohs, the Lewis chessmen, the pre-historic reindeer sculpture, the Amaravati limestone reliefs, etc. Be sure to donate a small amount and get yourself an audio-guide and map at the entrance.",Incredible Museum with so much to see!
"October 4, 2011","We spent a complete day at the British Museum and it was not enough to be able to see everything!  It was wonderful though. There is so much to see from so many different eras of time and countries that even one who is not a 'museum type' would find it extremely interesting and enlightening.  The Egyptian rooms with the mummies and artifacts are fantastic as well as the Greek, Assyrian friezes, the Rosetta Stone, the Obelisks (monument pillars) telling the defeats and history of the people.  Also, the guides showed how many things corresponded to facts in the Bible. Until the last century, it was not believed that many of these persons or places existed but artifacts found in the last century which are displayed at the British Museum have changed their view of the Bible as being very factual.  There's also several places to eat lunch or have tea and the food is delicious!  Overall, it was great!",Loved it!

"April 5, 2022","Controversy of the exhibits aside, the British Museum is a must for anyone - living or visiting London.  The exhibits are truly awe-inspiring and there's so much that each visit can be completely fresh and new.  I can't recommend coming here enough.",Stonehenge Exhibition spoilt by lack of information when booking online.
"February 28, 2022","We booked tickets to the Stonehenge exhibition online in good faith.  On arrival, we were informed by a surly security guard (rear entrance) that wheeled luggage was *not allowed.  (We had one 10kg suitcase between us.)   Nowhere during the booking process did it tell us this.  In fact, it was only through searching afterwards that we found the rule - on a downloadable word document.  We had to click three times on small print to find it.  Having travelled across London especially early for this exhibition, four hours before our train home, this was disappointing.  No sympathy from security guard - only a sarcastic 'read the small print.'  No apology from staff when we asked for our tickets to be refunded.  Why is there not a pop-up alert on the booking page?We ended up at the rather wonderful Charles Dickens museum on nearby Doughty Street,  where we were able to store our small suitcase f.o.c. If we'd travelled especially to London to see the Stonehenge exhibition, I would have been livid.British Museum  -  please make it abundantly clear on your website and booking forms that wheeled luggage of any description cannot be brought onto your premises.We would have left our suitcase at our hotel.",Must visit place in london

"October 4, 2021","I'm sorry to say I was really disappointed by my experience here. On arrival, we passed through the bag check area quickly, then expected to have our pre-booked tickets checked at the door. Nope. There wasn't a member of staff to be seen, therefore pre-booking our tickets (which we were more than happy to do, since we believed this would limit numbers and increase Covid safety) was completely pointless. We wandered straight in to the building without so much as a greeting. No maps or literature to be had, so we didn't know where to start in such a huge place. We headed off and just hoped we wouldn't miss anything. It quickly became apparent the place was busy - too busy - and since many people weren't wearing masks, or were wearing them incorrectly, we quickly felt uncomfortable as it wasn't always easy to distance. Because of feeling uncomfortable, it was difficult to relax and enjoy the exhibits.I was also disappointed with the staff. Most of the ones we saw acted like they didn't particularly want to be there. They didn't seem to engage with visitors, not even a smile or a nod. In fact, one was so intent on playing with her phone that she almost walked right into me, and another was sitting down doing a Sudoku.The one good point was there was plenty of hand sanitiser dotted around - but that's not going to help very much if there are too many people around.In the end, we were so disappointed and uncomfortable that we only did half the museum, then left. There is so much to do in London, and we chose this place thinking it would be great, and that care was being taken re: Covid, only to find that isn't the case.",Love the medieval artefacts.

"August 25, 2021","The British Museum is vast so you need to plan if there are specific areas you wish to visit. I thoroughly recommend the exhibitions. There is a charge for them but they are exceptionally well curated. Most recently I visited the Nero exhibition which set out his biography, his place in the dynasty of emperors that started with Augustus. Its main focus was to engage you with Nero's reputation. Was it deserved or was it an historical character assassination after his downfall.  Artefacts that illustrate his military campaigns, his building and public works and his turbulent political and married life were clearly displayed and signed in an order that made it relatively easy for the novice to begin to understand the period and the issues that were relevant to the understanding of Nero's reputation.  The Museum is just a wonderful place and the exhibitions are always worth the payment.","""Where we keep all the stuff we stole Museum"""
"August 3, 2021","Great place but should be called ""Where we keep all the stuff we stole Museum""When we visted Egypt the answer to many questions was no you will find that in the British Museum and how right our guide in Egypt was,this place is full of plundered stuff from other countries,I am not saying give it back becuase it was great to visit when these places are considered to be no go areas until the pandemic ends.A well laid out museum,not confined or  claustrophobic like the National History museum and well signed.","Crowded, hot, stuffy, unhealthy"

"March 11, 2021","Like New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art and Paris' Louvre, the scale of the British Museum can only be appreciated in person as pictures don't capture the building's sheer size and scope.  The famed cultural institution is so large, it's best to plan on visiting it over a few days.The famed institution's collection easily exceeds 8 million objects and pieces of art. Some of those are controversial as they were obtained during the height of the British Empire and their ownership is contested by other countries.It's almost difficult to comprehend this glorious institution originated from a collection of art objects and books bequeathed from a single individual, that of Irish doctor, Hans Sloane.  Over 2 centuries later, the building, which still exists on its original site, has grown and is now home to more than 8 million pieces of art.",Experience

"May 12, 2020",Easy to spend the day taking in history from all around the world. Beautiful building and a must for any trip to London.,Free access to unparalleled collection
"May 2, 2020","This museum is described as the oldest museum in the world, with an “unrivalled collection of antiquities”. Hard to argue with that! It is indeed a massive museum, with dozens of galleries dedicated to various countries, regions, and eras. Too much to take in during one visit, not just for the time it would take, but for how overloaded your brain would become. We reviewed the floor plan and list of galleries, and selected three sets of galleries, along with “Enlightenment”. We had two hours, but didn’t keep to just the three selected galleries - there was always something in the next room that drew our eye. We didn’t read as many labels and descriptions as we perhaps should have, but we still learned a lot. An unexpected treat was the Enlightenment room, built as a library for King George III, it now presents a contemplation on the emergence of scientific research and discovery, and the establishment of institutions such as the British Museum. I didn’t come across anything that acknowledges that some of the research and collection of artifacts was conducted under circumstances involving racism, exploitation, occupation, and oppression, all of which co-existed with the ideas and ideals of the Enlightenment. Amazing that admission is free to the permanent collection. So many attractions in London charge absurd entry fees.","Fresh, airy museum, good at the social distancing"
"October 4, 2020","Fresh, airy museum, good at the social distancing, lots on Greek/Egyptian history. Spent about 2.5 hours here.",Ground floor open only.
"October 3, 2020","Slightly disappointed we couldn’t visit the upper floors. Booked online, and one way system operating here, start with Egypt with the Elgin marbles can get a tad busy here, spent a few hours visiting the ground floor with a coffee break £3.40 a bit expensive,on the ground floors you have Africa, and the America’s all very interesting.",Tantra exhibition
"October 2, 2020",Poked nose around the door at 230pm. Hot humid and comparitively crowded given that we are all supposed to be socially distancing. Not safe in my view. Avoid or go at a quieter time. ,Slightly strange but well organised
"September 24, 2020",It was a novel experience a return in very different circumstances but the reason for this was obvious and well managed. Personally I would have relished greater freedom but I fully understand why this new system was nexess,This is a British Museum without many British artists and exhibits - all colonialism
"September 22, 2020",Great colonial museum. Family-friendly and gay-friendly. Very pricey when it comes to food and souvenirs.,Let’s go see the mummies 
"September 16, 2020",One word Massive! Very organized and clean. There was oh so much to see and I fell more in love with the artifacts and the history behind this massive building. Would love to go again especially for the museum. ,Amazing Museum!

"February 13, 2020",I have never been interested visiting museums but since I had spare time on last day of my visit. I found it beyond all imaginations. A must visit for all travellers.,A Top Museum in London
"February 12, 2020","I love the British Museum. It has everything a history buff like me could hope for. It is clean, well-organised and has helpful, well-trained staff. I especially love the egyptological exhibitions. I do realise that many of the artefacts have been stolen from other countries (Greece and the lost marbles, anyone?) and I don't think it's right, but the museum itself still is well worth a visit. I have visited this place many times throughout my life and it never ceases to take my breath away!",Excellent
"February 12, 2020",The British Museum is the world’s oldest national public museum and is the best spot of the world´s History. Just amazing!,Super fun

"February 11, 2020","One day is not enough, but is free!  Everything is amazing and well organized. Regularly have privated paid expositions.My recommendation is, bring confortable shoes and arrive early. ",Well worth a visit
"October 9, 2019",Whilst the web site says it opens at 10 you can enter the court yard earlier and go through security and collect you maps and audio guides. I recommend you do this as then once it turns 10am you are ready to go straight to the areas that most interest you. There is loads to see and the layout is a bit confusing so be prepared to walk round for a couple of hours. Some areas will be really busy.,Wonderful exhibitions
"October 9, 2019","Fantastic display of Egyptian, Assyrian, Mesopotamia sculpture, pots etc on the ground floor. So much to see there but you do need a lot of time. Great little gift shop with good range. Easy walking distance from hop on hop off stop.",AMAZING
"October 9, 2019",I was impressed with the museum. Worth to visit well organised and very informative. A perfect place to spend a few hours.,Outstanding museum
"October 8, 2019",Suggest getting there at the opening as the crowds later in the day are overwhelming.  So many artifacts to see.  Suggest purchasing the audio guide and review the floor plan for the location of certain exhibits prior to visiting so that you can design a plan to see those that are most interesting. ,signage not great
"October 8, 2019","whilst packed with a huge amount of artefacts particularly Greek, Egyptian and Roman - there are hidden gems such as variety of clocks and timepieces.  It would be helpful if the description of galleries on the museum maps matched the signs on the walls ! Possible to send huge amount of time looking (some of the descriptive labels are too small) but also possible to ‘nip’ and find one particular item and return many times.Donations are welcomed - but there is no charge to look round the museum although specially staged exhibitions do carry a cost. ",So Much to See
"October 8, 2019",What an enormous collection of history.  You can spend a couple of days here but you're usually wiped out after a few hours.  I recommend buying tickets online to avoid lines.  Try to go early before the tour and school trips arrive or later in the day after they leave.  I recommend taking a break halfway through.  We had audio guides but found we didn't need them because we just read the displays.  I found the Ancient Egypt exhibits to be the most interesting.  ,Plan a long visit
"October 8, 2019","Not what I was expecting for the British museum as most of the artefacts are from other countries, I thought it would be British history through the ages. That said it is amazing with so much to see. We only had a couple of hours which was nowhere near long enough, I would say at least half a day is needed. Very claustrophobic from the sheer amount of people at times but nonetheless worth a visit.",WOW
"October 8, 2019","I have visited London many times, and have been to several museums, but never to the British Museum until my last trip here. All I can say is WOW and AMAZING! London has some incredible museums and art galleries, but as of now, I think this may be my favorite. I was further being stupid in not spending enough time here, but that is a mistake for which I will not make again on my next visit. This is an absolutely incredible museum. ",A travel in Time

"October 8, 2019","So I went twice in the last year- once with my 6yr and 8month old. The second time was with just adults. I will focus this review with visiting with kids.  MOBILITY:If you have a small stroller take that! Just make sure you can fit your goodies in a good under-basket. They do have a few elevators, but it’s easier to lift if you can.FOOD: I was able to feed and give snacks at a few locations. You can go in-and out from the museum to the outer courtyard, that freedom was great. They also have a cafe area where you can stop a few times, nurse or snack. I brought my own snacks, the cafe did not have a great selection of kid friendly food. PREPARE:I wanted to see everything. It helped before visiting, to map out the different things they have. My 6yr old picked 4 things she really wanted to see- and then I told her we would do one thing I wanted, then one she wanted. Having clear expectation, and making her an important part of the planning was crucial. Taking turns in what she wanted to see was a great heaven sent idea. She had a blast, and the whole family was able to see most of it. Plan for at least 4 hours. ",True history....
"January 25, 2020",Had a quick look around but you probably need a week to do it properly. The museum is laden with artefacts from all over the world. It felt a bit too much to comprehend but obviously a must do when in town. Enjoy......,brilliant

"January 6, 2020",Plan for at least 4 hours if not more if you are interested in visiting the important artefacts / sculptures.,"this was a museum visit from hell,"
"January 3, 2020","the very long lines for security plus long lines to leave the museum. trying to get near the Rosetta stone was impossible. Why would any parent in their right mind take a child to a museum like this, we witnessed a child frantically looking for his parent, he did not speak English, I tried to get him to stay where he was out side the Rosetta stone exit where we had seen him frantically pushing through the crowds, but of no avail, not a  museum members in sight. However, once we managed to squeeze past the blockage in front of the Rosetta stone we enjoyed a quite nice visit to see the Elgin Marbles, I had a thought that maybe the some of bodies could be reunited with the heads in Athens, seems a pity that at least they could at least be reunited! We also visited the Persian exhibit, a very nice young guide took us to the area as it seemed to be in an obscure area.  Lunch was good, we were lucky to get a the last reservation at 12:30, after that time no reservations, a long lines.  However, many small eateries around the museum, you will not starve. Once again I notice wait staff and guides all foreign, all very pleasant, and with good command of the language, where are all the UK workers!",Best museum in the world

"December 18, 2019","We were only able to scratch the surface of the marvelous collection. Your choice is scan quickly and try to see about 50 percent or come back two ior three times and savor the quality of the treasures inside. There were a great number of people trying to do the former and could get in the way of your enjoyment, but let them hurry by and take in the cultural history this museum affords.",A realy great museum!

"December 18, 2019","The museum has introduced an extra security level and queuing system to enter. Security guards are checking bags and then a line of youthful employees encouraging you to give £3.00 to enter and support the upkeep of the museum. I had pre-booked tickets to see the exhibition ‘Inspired by the east’ and found myself in the fast track queue without the request for money. I thought the exhibition was an interesting insight into how the Ottoman Empire was reflected into the West when Europeans began travelling. Some of the art was beautiful. It was worth going. I love this museum it’s wide, open and light central court with all the exhibits radiating off at the different levels. At busy times there are not enough seats, so grab one of the portable ones from beside the information desks.There is a useful cloakroom, £2.00 for each coat. Bags are £2.50 on wet cold days it’s good to be able to wander around in the warmth without heavy coats.I’ve already got my ticket to visit the Troy exhibition next.",A Must See
"December 17, 2019","It’s a beautiful place even without going to see an exhibition! (Though the exhibits are amazing and well worth seeing).

"December 15, 2019",I went to see the exhibition of Ancient Roman and Assyrian stone statues. I had seen the Assyrian Winged gate guardians in Berlin and came to see the originals in London. The exhibition was so good. So many top quality examples of ancient cultures. The original Assyrian statues are so impressive and there are several sets on display with different features.

"December 14, 2019","Yes, entrance to the British Museum is free but the Museum does charge a handsome fee for its special exhibits. I wanted to see ""Troy: Myth and Reality"" more than once (plus relax in the serene Members Room) so I joined for $78 (a few dollars more than the pre-Boris pound would have yielded). Also, the 20% discount on the excellent and extensive offerings in the shop comes in handy before Christmas.",The building alone makes it worth a visit!
"December 13, 2019","The British Museum really is a must see in London. I've been there several times and it still impresses me!It contains countless treasures from around the world, and yes it looks fairly normal from the outside, but the glass covered central court is just stunning.

Recommended for all ages!,a great place to visit
"September 30, 2019","City museums are free in London, so if you have time to visit any of them, spend as much time as you can to see both art and historical exhibits.

I was very impressed with the size of this museum and all that it contains. Beautiful displays and a nice gift shop.",Crowded

"September 30, 2019",Even though there were huge crowds today the museum really caters for them. Plenty of things to see. We just didn’t have long enough so only saw the clocks special themed rooms and the mummies. I felt sick and Sunday (name) a security guard was very helpful. ,Remarkable
"September 30, 2019","A visit to the British Museum is a visit to the history of England.  The collection of objects gained (taken? stolen? acquired?) by the Empire is amazing.   Wherever the British went, they returned with all manner of art forms.  Whether it was Egypt, India or some other far away land, treasures were brought back and are on display in the halls of the museum.  One can spend hours or days and still not see all that there is.  Truly an impressive museum.",Private tour recommended
"September 30, 2019","We took a private 2 1/2 hour tour because the museum is huge with thousands of artifacts.  The guide was extremely knowledeable, friendly and took us directly to the exhibits we wanted to see the most and then some that were very interesting as well.",Full day trip
"September 30, 2019","We went there for couple of hours as we were using London Hip Hop bus tour so we had to cover other attractions hence could not visit the entire museum. I must say this is a full day trip, lot to see and lot of information to go through.Do not use Hip Hop bus tours to come here, you will not have enough time to visit other attractions.",intersting Museum
"September 30, 2019",The british museum is one of the biggest museum in term of the collaection that represents different history and cultures all over the world. the ancient egypt section is really interested with mummies. the section of watches and how it was developed in early ages also worth the visit.,Wow!!!
"December 5, 2019","The artifacts, displays from around the world and ages is outstanding!!!I didn’t know I would ever see Cleopatra in my lifetime and there she was mummified!Such a treasure and something for everyone. Lots of school children can be there- so if you have a headache or are overstimulated be sure to bring ear plugsI do suggest planning ahead if you need to use the toilet... lineups can be astronomical!",Don't go tired...like me
"December 4, 2019","Since it's free admission (donation suggested), you should at least splurge on an audio guide if you're not part of a guided group tour.  Then just wander.  My biggest mistake was leaving this spectacular institution for near the end of a long day. So after the Egyptian, Assyrian, etc galleries near the entrance, I was already exhausted and intimidated by what lay ahead.  After about 2 hours I barely got through 20% of what was worth seeing.  You can easily spend a whole day here.",Troy exhibition another big success
"December 4, 2019","We are members and visit all the major exhibitions.  Troy was amongst the very best.  It included the story of the myth, finds from archaeology and artworks.   Explanations we accessible.  Allow two hours",Wonderful
"December 4, 2019",Visited many times now and never tire of it. Best visited for 2 hour visit in early morning leaving the rest of the day to avoid crowds and do something else.,Must visit
"December 4, 2019","Finally got to visit the British Museum. Excellent exhibitions,displays n collections. My teenage son n I especially enjoyed Kathe Kollwitz's prints exhibtion and the Egyptian collection. Visit the Great Court Restaurant on the upper floor. Excellent food. A good place to take a break! ","A must, the museum of looting"
"December 3, 2019","A poignant experience always, the British made swum has emblematic pieces, torn from various corners of the world. Literally grabbed, cut out, hacked out. Some of these treasures are almost painful to look at, such as the Elgin marbles, last room on the left at ground level. They were robbed from the Parthenon by lord Elgin’s men, cut and carted out. In spite of the horrid damage caused by their hacking and cutting the marble out, the friezes of the horses, and other pieces are breathtaking. I still think they ought to be where they belong, as half of the pieces, or at least pay for them. My teen endured it well.",Amazing artefacts but a nightmare to get around
"December 3, 2019","If you want a one stop location to learn about the history of the world then this is the right place. However, even with a map, it was difficult to navigate through all the different floors and hallways. You also need a lot of time to get through each section so if on a short holiday, perhaps either limit the things you'd like to see, or skip this altogether for a time you're on a longer stay.",My kids really enjoyed it.
"December 2, 2019","One of the best museums we've been to as a family. Extensive collection, some of the highlights include the Ancient Egypt mummies and the King's Library. Has good amenities and souvenir shop. Will go again",Nice Place
"December 1, 2019","I visited with my father, whom uses a walking stick was allowed to avoid the queues to enter the museum by a security guard. I enjoyed seeing the Egyptian and Ancient Greek and Roman but I didn’t stay long I will have to spend more time in the museum next time I visit.","Excellent, although crowded"

"November 30, 2019","Went with family friends, mostly because I wanted to see the Rosetta Stone. It was free, but after a long walk we were already quite tired. some incredible artefacts but we had just been to Rome, so they often paled in comparison.","Very vast, lost of things to see."
"November 29, 2019","The museum is very big, and there is lots of interesting things to see inside, in various different topics. All the information is laid out very nicely! Leave a bit of time to go thorugh all interesting areas.",I believe this is a one-time failure 
"November 29, 2019","The experience I had at the British Museum  was not as I had expected.I came on a Sunday, probably the most packed day, but also the most legitimate day to visit.I was trying to get some guidance or help at the reception, but mostly got a “DIY answers”.The general daily tour ran out of places (you cannot pre-reserve) and no one was trying to help with an alternative. I left after an hour.I assume if they would take some charge from everyone and gave minimal service, my experience would have been better.",DISAPOINTING
"November 29, 2019",I love the British Museum so decided to visit their restaurant. A great disapointment. It was very expensive and the portions were very small. With all the compettion locally I thought it would give better value.,Sculptures and Artifacts from Yore
"November 28, 2019","The museum is huge and full of amazing art and artifacts from across the world. However, I did not get a whole lot out of it by reading the little write-ups. I would recommend going on a tour with a guide to truly appreciate the beauty and the offerings of the place. ",holymoly much to see.
"November 28, 2019",suggest following the recommended sites in the map first. then backtrack to other items.  the rosetta stone a big hit of course ,Worth a visit
"November 28, 2019","This was the third time I came to London and finally I got the chance to see this Museum. It’s a big place so you have to spent more than half a day there if you want to see everything. We like the Egyptians mummies and the Chinese exhibits. Even if there are a lot of visitors, you won’t feel crowded. Definitely worth a visit and remember, it’s free. You pay only if you want to make a donation to the museum. ",Incredible Architecture
"November 5, 2019","Definitely worth a visit but go early as the crowds are ridiculous, especially in summer. Free entry which is awesome but the security line is SO long at peak times. Architecture of the building is amazing. Well set out museum and the Egyptian section is incredible. The Rosetta Stone is a highlight too.",History
"November 4, 2019","I absolutely love the place massive building feels like never ending ,,,,,,,collective items from all over the world",Fantastic
"November 4, 2019","Really good museum, so much to see you could spend days there. Lots of amazing big rooms with high ceilings, very grand. You can see why it's one if the most visited places in London. Definitely a must-do!",A wonderful place
"November 3, 2019",If you come in London you have to visit it. You can find most important artworks. It's amazing to see Stele di Rosetta or real Rapa Nui. You can walk in the history from ancient age to modern time. We took audio guide for exploring better all artworks that are there. A fantastic experience. ,Fantastic visit with 11 year old son.
"November 3, 2019","We had a fabulous day exploring this wonderful museum. Before visiting I had done a bit of online research of artefacts we would like to see, which I recommend you do before visitng.   I also discovered that you can hire an interactive family guide for £6.   On arrival we queued up and hired the family guide and bought a map. The family guide was brilliant, we were able to get round most rooms and focus on a few key pieces rather than wandering around aimlessly and becoming overwhelmed. My son really enjoyed the game aspect of the family guide, as it allows you to compete with other family members and score points. I highly recommend hiring a family guide if visiting with children over 7yrs.We spent almost 3hrs here and my son came away with a new appreciation for history and had a wonderful time.",A must see when in London
"November 2, 2019","We love the British museum for its display of artifacts from all over the world. Although we struggle with the reality that the British took these relics from their ""colonies"" we do enjoy visiting all the mummies in particular. They are fascinating, especially if you have not been to Egypt. All their exhibits are well done, well displayed in an inviting, vast and beautiful building that was recently remodeled to include an interior cafe, bookstore with a glass cover over the courtyard inside. Sadly we are so old we were here before that courtyard was covered but the building remains iconic and beautiful!  Their bookstore is always worth a visit too!",Mummies and the Rosetta Stone!
"November 2, 2019",Heavy on the Greek and Egyptian theme displays but well worth a visit.  Don’t bring a bag and your quene will be much shorter.,Lots of useful information
"November 1, 2019",Its an easy museum to stroll through.  I really enjoyed learning of the fire in 1666 and how the city recovered.  ,Not all exhibits are sensitive to other cultures and their needs
"November 1, 2019","As an Indian, when I last visited, I was appalled by the way that several ways in which statues of importance to my culture, such as the statue of Hindu gods, were displayed in a way that does not honour how we see them or respect that a religion is not an exhibit, It means something to those who practise it and this blatant placing of such holy statues in a museum was not respectful of my views. We see statues of god as being as holy as our gods in their physical incarnations. I am sure that others may have felt the same way as my family members agreed. I think some of the things there should be revised and returned to the countries they came from to be honoured and respected dutifully.",Must see
"November 1, 2019","This is a World’s class museum. Must see. Museum building is spectacular and spacious. Great collection of art , artifacts , sculptures, etc from every corner of the world. ",Great afternoon out
"November 21, 2019",Fab afternoon out at the British Museum. Was so much to do that we will need to go back again to do the 2nd floor! Recommend the Ancient Egypt section in particular,World Class
"November 20, 2019","One of the best in the world. So many critically important artifacts, although questionable if they should truly be in British procession. Just ask any Greek if they believe the Marbles should be returned to Greece. That said, it's a must visit, the range of works is incredible.",Met up with my American pal
"November 20, 2019","It's always a good educational experience, no matter how many times I have been, my friend & I had great time. A must visit, perfect for all age groups  ",Wanted to do a museum
"November 19, 2019","We headed to the British Museum on Saturday it was really busy and when we got inside I could see why. The displays and different artefacts where vast, it was really interesting and the building inside is stunning!",Spectacular 
"November 19, 2019","I enjoyed every minute in the museum , it’s truly one of the best in the world and contains the most rare and interesting pieces I have seen. In particular their Egyptian and Greek rooms are the most spectaculars and crowded of them all. ",Fantastic museam
"November 18, 2019",We visited to see the Egyptian mummies and artifacts. We also visited as much as we could walk around until our legs felt tired.We have made visits many times before and every time there is something new to see. Great for every age.,Africa Room 25
"November 18, 2019",While visiting London I set my sights on going to the British museum to see and show my companion the copper heads of the Yoruba tribe from Nigeria.  It was a must do and also a better understanding of the culture. We did not have to read much on what the sculptures of art were telling others. We were able to read through the messages of the different tribal work.  It was at times overwhelming and by the time we were done we we really did not want to see any other part of the museum. While the history was enlightening for us it really was a sad to see the messages told to us through this art work. The main message I received in most of them were that our African people had no idea what they had agreed upon once the trade of of a nation started happening. You could clearly see the aftermath of the message through their artwork.  God Bless the motherland.,"Visit, take your time and enjoy...it is worth it!!!"
"November 17, 2019","It has something for every member of the family and could be a great place for kids to learn!  This is a place to visit with time, if you are like us and want to be able to read everything and grasp it, my advise will be come early and try to set a plan prior to your visit.  There is no possibility to look at everything in detail in just one visit.  Make peace with that reality!!  This place needs a week to itself to walk and see everything.  The building itself is a beauty and the are  where it is located is booming with cafes and souvenirs shops.  Accessible via bus and tub, it is free, and you can decide if you book a tour (paying) or not.  There are two cafes and one restaurant, that we saw in inside the building.",So many excellent exhibitions worth seeing!
"November 17, 2019","The British Museum has free entry and multiple floors of exhibitions. There is something for everyone. I really enjoyed the indigenous cultures exhibition, I learned something about the wonderful indigenous cultures through the world. The Captain Cook exhibition was also very informative. The gift shop had a great selection of books and gifts, if only my checked baggage limit could be increased.",One of the WOnders of the Woerld
"November 16, 2019","This Musuem is one of the great museums of the world.  It is tough to explain it but in addition to the great Egypt collection, it also has Assyrian collections and other great world treasures",Great experience!
"November 11, 2019",The museum is free and you can enjoy lots of free tours! You can learn a lot about the history of the world!,Great Museum
"November 11, 2019","I have been to the British Museum countless times. It never gets old and there are amazing exhibitions all tear round. Every time friends from abroad visit me in London, I always suggest they spend some time among the Egyptian Mummies or the Roman ruins, at this spectacular establishment.One aspect I would change though, is crowd management. I would allocate slots through the day, in order to limit the number of visitors at any one time. Some people are rude and inconsiderate and would physically push you out of the way, in order to get the perfect selfie near the Cleopatra Sarcophagus or the Rapa Nui Moai.Please visit but maybe try to go during the week, definitely not on a weekend!",Hours of fascinating exhibits and history
"November 9, 2019","This is must-see. We recommend the audio guide even if English is your first language. It's helpful when you approach exhibits to hear and learn a bit more than what is available to read. Take your time, wear comfortable shoes, and learn as much as you can. We especially enjoyed the ancient near east exhibits.",Visit
"November 9, 2019","Was not happy having to be put in a queue then made to feel crap been asked to make a contribution, I am a British  tax payer who no doubt  have paid  a hell of a lot into the system.  The tourists  should pay  like I have to in other countries.",Must Visit
"November 9, 2019","This is a ""must visit"" in London.  Incredible location and you can't see it all unless you stay for the day.  Be ready to fight the annoying, picture-taking crowds around the popular displays. But it's worth it!",Enthralling visit
"November 8, 2019",Private tour of the Chinese section of the British MuseumIt was fun getting into the museum an hour before the weekend hordes arrive. We were treated to a tour of the highlights of the Chinese section of the museum. I had been to this gallery before bu the guide we had made it much more interesting and informative. There some real treasures there but the best is the 3D type video of a Chinese scroll painting - enthralling.,One of the world's very best museums
"November 7, 2019","Accumulating centuries of conquests and donations of private collections, the British museum is an astounding repository of human artifacts. Far too extensive to complete in one day, you need multiple visits to start to embrace the enormity of its collection. At any one time, only a small fraction of its total collection is on exhibit, so you need to visit on multiple occasions and return frequently to take in all the magnificent items on exhibit. It has multiple cafes, restaurants and resting places, as well as great gift shops for the wearly.",One of my favorite places!
"November 7, 2019","This is truly one of my favorite places on the planet.  Most of the museum is FREE, though they do have donation boxes around (which you should do anyway).  The special exhibits have a ticket charge, but they are well worth it.  I never get enough of the permanent collections though, and can easily spend hours here.  I've been here twice and will visit every time I'm in London, for sure.",Fantastic Musuem
"November 7, 2019",Very busy and really warm so put your coat in the cloakroom.  You can get a childs guide to the museum which was really useful for my granddaugher who loved finding different objects from the list and getting her stamp at the end,Beautiful and diverse
"November 7, 2019","As a lover of art, culture and history, the British museum was one of my favorites things in London. The Egyptian section was amazing, and I would highly recommend the Japanese section to. Also right outside there are a lot of things to do also.","So many, many things to see (and then they hustle for donations)"
"October 29, 2019","Wonderful museum stuffed to the brim with interesting things to see, that you cannot possibly finish even within a day. When we visited on a weekday, the Egyptian exhibition rooms with the mummies were chock full of people, leaving the other areas much more empty and enjoyable to explore, like the fascinating Roman section. One caveat - there was a row of young museum staff literally hustling for donations when you first enter the museum, which was fascinatingly tacky for such an institution. I mean, these enthusiastic folks were literally shouting at people to donate, and saying passive aggressive things like, ""That should be the way!"" when someone came forward. I didn't see this in any other museum we visited during our UK trip. At any rate, donation boxes were everywhere within the British Museum, and we were more than happy to drop in the suggested 5 pounds each before we left (without being coerced). If the British Museum decided to charge that amount, I'm sure people would willingly pay to see such world-class exhibits.",Absolutely amazing 
"October 29, 2019","Unbelievable beautiful. The history, the artifacts, the building itself. If you go to London this is a MUST SEE. ",Lots to see and take in
"October 29, 2019","I have been several times to this museum and always forget how much is inside, the outside is wonderful with the pillared entrance and then you come across the Rosetta Stone. Each gallery has amazing artifacts, and you spend far longer looking than you'd think, personally it needs more than one visit to do it justice. If you don't have a lot of time, then you must visit the Egyptian rooms and the Elgin Marbles are must sees. There are places to eat and several gift outlets.There is always a special exhibition on so check the website. Not too much in ""the hands on"" mode for children, but interesting all the same. The queue to get in is usually long from the word go, so be prepared.",Don’t miss this one
"October 29, 2019","Great day at the British Museum! Antiquities from all over the world. If you’re in London, don’t miss this gem.",So beautiful.. But 
"October 29, 2019",So many things to see in the museum but so many people in the mummy's part. The others parts are Interesting too but with less people so you  have time to enjoy your visit,Brit
"October 28, 2019",Really a lot of things to see and a lot of walking. Excellent! This Museum has a lot to offer. You need a lot of time to explore everything and you won't be sorry,Finest Archaeological and History Museum in the World
"October 28, 2019","The British Museum is probably the finest, most comprehensive and extensive museum of the history of not just Britain but humanity located anywhere in the world. The collections are immense and enable the visitor to gain a really perspective into the evolution of both society and civilisation from the earliest man right up to the end of the classical period from all continents of the world. My 13 year old, who wants to be an archaeologist when he grows up, was absolutely in raptures and could have spent a few days taking everything in. My younger 2 children, however, were somewhat overwhelmed by both the crowds and the sheer volume of exhibits so my advice to anyone who has younger children that are likely to tire after a couple of hours, have a plan around the key artefacts and exhibits that they will be interested in such as the Egyptian Mummies or the Acropolis Freeze/Elgin marbles and focus on these!",World class
"October 27, 2019",So much to see.  I took self audio tour and did top 10 must see.  That was 2 hours and didn't even see a quarter of exhibits.  ,Great museum

"November 6, 2019","The British Museum is a must see. The collections are fabulous. It tends to get very crowded so suggest you look at the private tour capability. For a small amount of money you can have a docent with no more than 20 people focus on a particular area of interest without the crowds.

"November 5, 2019","The entrance is beautiful and the exhibits are worth visiting, plenty of amazing pieces and lots to inspire the Artist within. If you are an Artist like me, very confident you would find inspiration here. For me, it could lead very well to my next piece, my next creation! ",Amazing place
"November 5, 2019","The museum is full of items acquired from other countries over the years, a collection of wealth from the empire.  Every room is fascinating.  There are some famous pieces such as the Elgin marbles which are a must see.  Free entry.",Great Islamic history and artefacts
"November 5, 2019","We went to see the Islamic section of the museum, which we all loved as a family. My children loved learning about the history of different countries and areas of the Islamic world and learning about the different types of people that make up the Muslim nation. They loved the ones that had information that you could scan and hear extra facts and songs and first hand narrations from people like Cat Stevens, who is now called Yusuf Islam. It was a great afternoon had by all and I think we will go back again to see the rest of the beautiful building.",Family trip

"November 5, 2019",This was my third visit to a specialist exhibition. Great exhibits which were nicely displayed  and lighted.

"October 26, 2019","Awesome museum, very good experience.You can find everything about World history, the collections are amazing. ","ANOTHER Unpleasant, Unexpected Experience - Beware!"
"October 25, 2019","The matter described here duplicates the events I described in a review of October 2018. Part one of our annual visit to London for a birthday celebration involves an afternoon at the British Museum. Last year I described how visitors are being pressured into giving a donation and the upset it caused. Well, as it was the same this year, I must assume the abuse is systematic and institutional. On both occasions, after passing through the security search, my wife was DIRECTED to go to one of the desks and make a donation. Let me repeat what I said in October 2018: entry to the museum is free and such pressure should not be being applied, especially by the sour faced girl who glared at me after I came to my wife’s assistance. This year I went to the Information desk and asked to see a customer service manager. An extremely professional discussion followed where it was agreed that the events as described should not have taken place. Crucially for this post, I was encouraged to make a complaint in writing to such a forum as this because senior management would otherwise take no notice. I have (generously) given money to the museum over many decades but pressure applied to so many people unfamiliar with this magnificent place must surely do it nothing but harm.",Lots to see in a quick visit.
"October 24, 2019","Having only about an hour and a half at the museum, we first went to the major highlights (Rosetta Stone, Easter Island Statue, The Pantheon Sculptures), then wandered to see the other exhibits.The museum is very well laid out, so it's easy to get from one exhibit to another without having to backtrack.",Rosetta Stone
"October 23, 2019","Wow, seeing the Rosetta Stone as you walk in is truly amazing.It is hard to believe how important it was in deciphering Egyptian writingsTo us the next impressive exhibits were the Elgin marbles that were removed from Athens.There must be some controversy with the Greeks since it was the Turks that gave permission to remove them.You can spend countless hours walking the halls and it will help if you explore the website and try to narrow down the exhibits you have a particular interest in seeing",British Museum
"October 23, 2019","My daughter and I enjoyed the beautiful British Museum with its expansive ceiling and design. It houses many artifacts of interest and I suppose it is good they are in one place. However, I side on the part of the countries, specifically Greece, who have requested the stripped artifacts from the Parthenon and other buildings at the Acropolis be returned to Greece. With that mindset, it was difficult for me to admire Elgin's Marbles and other items of great Greek importance. However, the overall experience of the Museum and what it offers viewers is a good one. We finished off our visit with an afternoon tea in the museum restaurant up at the top near the expansive ceiling - that was a nice experience!",Plan ahead for best results
"October 23, 2019","This mighty, huge Museum contains so much that if you just go in without at least a rudimentary idea of what you would like to see, you will get 'gallery fatigue'.

"October 22, 2019","If you’ve read my other reviews of multiple restaurants / venues you’ll see I’m resoundingly positive . Though the museum is stunning as a building and as a place of awe and education today the service and signage was lacking . I came with a colleague after work about 415pm having had an act of Parliament passed for our shifts to coincide and for her child care arrangements . We walked up the security check in and the mans desk and aisle  on the other side of the railing was clear so I went to himAs my side was occupied. He sent me backAnd then invited someone else from further back in my queue . Having worked with the public for 38 years I didn’t find this big funny or clever and briefly politely told him so . We entered the building to see the Islamic art exhibition , saw the poster for it and walked up a big staircase to be told we couldn’t buy tickets there , went down to an information desk and got a smarty pants reply when we asked for tickets and were then directed to a ticket office tucked away . We were then told that it was£14 each and it was closing in an hour so we declined as we needed more than an hour . Very poor signage .we came in through the main entrance and to a blank wall facing  us. At this point we then wandered around the regular exhibits . English is my first language , I pity people for whom it is not",Too crowded to enjoy
"October 22, 2019","We looked forward to this so much and expected it to be one of the highlights of our visit. We even stayed nearby because we planned to spend a lot of time there. We were only able to spend two half days there though because of the crowds. The second day we left by early afternoon because it was so hot with so many people that I felt lightheaded. Mind you, I live in Texas, and I'm used to high temps! Overall, it was pretty disappointing. ",What a great museum
"October 13, 2019","It is not too big, but is packed of ancient history. We were really impressed with the content of the museum. A lot of pieces from Greece, Rome, Babylon, among other areas conserved almost perfectly.",The place to go for a day of learning
"October 13, 2019",We landed in London early and because we were unable to check into our hotel we decided to spend the day at the museum.  It was a great choice.  An amazing collection and something for everyone.  The only thing I would say is do not go on a weekend.  We went on'a Sunday and it was a mob scene.  I could not get over how many people were touching the objects - that was not pleasant to see.  Staff tried to keep them off but the lack of awareness of the value and fragility of the objects was disappointing.,Lots of artifacts taken during British expeditions
"October 13, 2019","The museums collection is impressive.  Many ancient world treasures in 1 location, most acquired over the course of England's imperial history.  They now have signs saying it is better for the artifacts to remain in England and could never be safely returned.  Would the other countries agree?",Great museum
"October 13, 2019","We visited on a rainy day, worth noting - the queue is long and your exposed to the elements. Families with children can go ahead in a separate shorter queue.We decided to go around the museum in a clockwise direction. This starts you off with the architectural based sections such as ancient Egypt. There is an awful lot of sculptures and architectural elements, bare with it, there's plenty more to the museum.The museum has numerous restaurants and cafes. The pizzeria is small, so don't count on being able to eat there.We had a great time and got tired before we completed the museum, so we rusheda bit. We'll definitely be back to take everything in.",Great range of artefacts from europe and beyond
"October 12, 2019",The British museum has an incredible range of artifacts and objects from all over the world arranged according to the period they originated from and the country or region. It is a fabulous way to get an idea of how civilisation progressed through history. It would take several days to see everything they have here so perhaps read up on what interests you and plan your visit accordingly.,One of the very best
"October 12, 2019","I love Egyptian history, the British museum didn’t disappoint. It was truly larger than expected and I could have done two days there...  I did it the day before the V&A, it was slightly better while both are greats.  Also... free is a bonus!",A great day out
"October 12, 2019","The British Museum was fantastic.  There is so so much to see there that we couldn't take it all in.   Loved the Egyptian room, The North Americas, the various private collections",...AND IT’S FREE!
"October 12, 2019","This amazing place is the jewel in the crown of London museums, possibly the best museum in all the world!  If you only have one day to visit (this London visit for us) then you have to be strategic in planning your time there.  You can spend days here and not see it all.   We focused on 2 areas we had not seen for many years: the original rooms - the oldest collections- and the Sutton Ho exhibit.  We also took in the African collection which is stunning.  And did I mention that, like many London museums, the entry fee to The British Museum is FREE! ",Too crowded
"October 12, 2019","A lot to see, but the lower level was crammed full of so many people we had problems moving.  I see timed tickets in the future.",Great place
"October 11, 2019",Love this place. Wish i have more to time to explore. Artifacts were so nice. The only museum that I’ve enjoyed so far (haven’t been to a lot though 😂),"Excellent,  we downloaded the plan from website "
"October 11, 2019",Also getting to the clock room at midday was excellent too. The layout is great but some clocks badly lot.  ,BRITISH MUSEUM IN THE GUTTER
"October 10, 2019","It’s been atleast 10 years since I have been to the BM and I thought it would be a lovely idea to visit and look at England’s / Britain’s history from Mediaeval to the Stone Age.   There’s a lot here that’s wonderful but I have had such an appalling experience I thought I should warn others who may come here.By the way it’s definitely worth a visit infact more than one as you won’t do it in one hit. Despite a beautifully designed modern structure inside the Georgian neoclassical building, the Museum collection on display is really still a hang over from the days of Empire and full of things rich aristocrats plundered from other countries .....some of course like the Egyptian Collection is rivalled only by Cairo Museum and the Louvre but frankly you would think the British Museum would be primarily celebrating well Britain and us The British.  If you want this you have to go to level 3.  It’s not signposted.  Nor is it signposted from the nearest Tube Tottenham Court Road.  On arrival you are forced to go through a ridiculous zig zag chicane like at an airport only much worse as there about 40 Barriers.  Then you are bagged checked and have to go through a ticket office style arrangement despite the fact the Museum and our heritage is supposed to be free.  I feel strongly about this as an historian and yes I know there are Govt underfunding but I don’t then expect a mouthful of abuse from a young female guard for not paying. I then had to empty out all my luggage and put in two separate containers as they said my bag was too big ...Really why it was an overnight bag surely they can cope with these they charge enough to mind them for an hour.  The East European woman in the bookshop snatched my money. Many new toilets were out of order but the worst thing of all is when I actually got to L3 to see English history ad archaeology there was nothing beyond 80 bc. It literally stops at the Bronze Age with a few Neolithic hand axes on display.  What about our amazing Mesolithic finds and even Palaeolithic instead you get another exhibition about some poor country we have plundered which is totally incongruous.  Also there is Sutton Hoo, the Milden Hoard, why can’t they build a replica of a Iron Age roundhouse or a Viking Longhouse  for people to go into.  Often when you to a Museum like Lewis there is a sign saying the BM have taken most of the best exhibits and left reproductions well why are they not on display.  Too many signs saying removed for study.  Well replace them then with something else.  The lighting is also poor. Coupled with noisy disinterested guards and boisterous and giggling school children who were not being kept in check by teacher and extirpate cafe prices otherwise excellent.   Cmon we can do better inBritain than this.",A fabulous place
"October 10, 2019",Each time I visit the Museum it has new experiences to offer in every department. I am always blown away by the range and quality of permanent exhibits and the wonder of the special exhibitions. It never ceases to amaze me at the level of craftsmanship of all Mankind dating back thousands of years and fills me with hope that the ingenuity of our species will prevail for solutions to present and future problems.,Huge museum
"October 10, 2019","Must go if you have the time and you love history. Plenty of artefacts to view, hours and hours of viewing. ",The best museum EVER
"October 10, 2019",No matter how many times I go there it’s always a pleasure and every time I discover something new. Even if you think you saw all rooms of permanent exhibition there is always some temporary exhibition waiting to be discovered ,Lots to see!
"October 9, 2019","If you’re going to be in London for a few days, definitely go here. For one thing, it’s free so why not?!  There is a lot of different exhibits, and plenty to see for all types of people. There is a cafe inside if you need a beverage or snack. Beautiful building to snap a pic of as well. You can spend a couple hours here or all day, make it what you will!",Extensive Museum
"October 9, 2019",Blown away by the artifacts and history on display.  This will occupy a few hours of your day if you want to troll this treasure trove of History,Excellent museum
"October 9, 2019","Went to this museum because my son wanted to see the mummies...he had been reading about them...We wandered for a while through the museum after not waiting very long in line, and were mesmerized by all artifacts we saw.My son also loved it, especially the mummies and the big Egyptian statues. We as adults loved it as well, moreover since muses are free from admission in the UK which is great in itself!",MESMERIZING ANYWHERE YOU GO
"October 9, 2019","We were blown away by the experience of wandering these amazing galleries. We split up so we could absorb exhibits without distraction, then met for lunch and revisited our favorites. Five transformative hours; could have spent at least another day there. Great people watching as well. ",British museum
"October 9, 2019","For me was OK,  not to my taste, but if you like bits of history , Egyptian artifacts and the like, you’ll enjoy it.",Fantastic!  Wish we'd had more time!
"October 7, 2019","We were here for 4 hours and it was not nearly enough.  Would loved to have had the time to come back another day, didn't even make it to a quarter of the museum.  The exhibits were fascinating.   I'm sure you could do it faster, but, if you like going at your own pace and reading and wandering about, set aside a good chunk of time.  Great stuff. ",Treasure haul of empire
"October 7, 2019",If you can get past the obvious issues with items of great cultural import having been taken from across the globe .. Could easily spend a day here and be left feeling you had just scratched the surface. Planning your trip ahead of time to make best use of your time is recommended.,Fascinating
"October 6, 2019","It’s obviously the British Museum. What a wonderful opportunity to see such sights from antiquity. So many things to see. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit and spent most of our time looking at pieces from Greece, Rome, Mesopotamia and Egypt. ",Wow!
"October 6, 2019","An amazing museum with tons of stuff to see.We used a guide which was a two-hour tour and hit some of the high points.  This was a good idea with the opportunity to go back on your own and see other things.And there is so much to see!  Plus, the entrance to the museum (not the tour) is FREE!",Outstanding
"October 5, 2019","The British Museum lived up to its stellar reputation.   Simply an unbelievable collection in an outstanding facility.   We went on the early morning tour, which really helped in getting set up for our visit.    A must see in London.",London's Treasure
"October 3, 2019","There are so many treasures to appreciate at the British Museum! The exhibits were well displayed and the narratives informative. We enjoyed our exploration of the museum and would recommend it to other visitors. Don't let the surly attitude of the cashiers at the gift shop and food services put you off. You're here for the exhibits, not the service providers.",So much to see!
"October 3, 2019",We spent 3 hours here before becoming ‘museum blind’. Free to enter so you could return several times if you lived near enough. Beautifully presented artefacts. The mummies were exceptional. ,Amazing but allow a lot of time or make several visits.
"October 3, 2019",This place is so large and has so much that we know we will need to go back next time we visit London because we barely scratched the surface.,One day here is not enough!
"October 3, 2019",Here are so many items and artefacts to see that a one day visit is not enough to explore them all. It's a wonderful place to go to admire 6.000 years of human history (both good and bad things!) Note that the queue to get inside can be a very long wait... We had Afternoon Tea after our tour: A very pleasant experience (we had ordered beforehand).,"I have mixed feelings about all of the antiquities that England ""saved"" from ancient cultures  ...."
"October 2, 2019","We tried to go to the museum at 10am on Saturday and the lines of people at the front and rear entrances would have literally been a 3+ hour wait. We gave up. But we returned to the museum on Tuesday, which was our last full day in the city. At 5pm we waited in line a few minutes, rather than several hours.It is impossible to see everything in this vast museum in a single visit. The 70 galleries are organized by geography, history, and theme. The amount of ancient artifacts they have from Egypt, Syria, Greece, and Asia is mind boggling.",IF YOU ONLY HAVE TIME FOR ONE SIGHT
"October 9, 2019","This museum is well worth the day we spent there, and we could have stayed another day or two to see it all.  Had a private guide whe made the place come alive!  ",One of the world's greatest museums.
"October 9, 2019",Not to be missed.  The only drawback is that it could take you years to really explore all the wonderful collections.  I have visited many times over the years and still haven't seen it all.,AMAZING
"October 9, 2019",I was impressed with the museum. Worth to visit well organised and very informative. A perfect place to spend a few hours.,Outstanding museum
"October 8, 2019",Suggest getting there at the opening as the crowds later in the day are overwhelming.  So many artifacts to see.  Suggest purchasing the audio guide and review the floor plan for the location of certain exhibits prior to visiting so that you can design a plan to see those that are most interesting. ,WOW
"October 8, 2019","I have visited London many times, and have been to several museums, but never to the British Museum until my last trip here. All I can say is WOW and AMAZING! London has some incredible museums and art galleries, but as of now, I think this may be my favorite. I was further being stupid in not spending enough time here, but that is a mistake for which I will not make again on my next visit. This is an absolutely incredible museum. ",去不了埃及來這也行

"October 7, 2019","The second obligated aim of our London tour was visiting of The British museum. We were most interested in seeing of Greek and Roman collection of  art work and main thing to see Egyptian collection. Earlier we saw Egyptian collections in Metropolitan (New York), Louvre (Paris), National Gallery (Сairo).  Each of them was amazing and splendid but we expected that London collection will be the best.   Unfortunately we can not say it now. Yes, the London collection of Egyptian artefacts is   great but other Egyptian collections are no worse, and in some ways even superior to it.Collection of Greek reliefs, sculptures and vasas is super.",So much history!
"October 7, 2019","The modern atrium in an old building is spectacular. Inside, there's so much to see, it's overwhelming. I would choose one period or country in history and save the rest for another day.",Unbelievable Treasure Trove
"October 7, 2019",My husband and I visited the museum in early September.  It's hard to believe that this is free considering the quantity and quality of treasures it holds!  Plan to spend at least a couple days here...and still you won't see everything!  Not to be missed while in London!,3 day vacation in London 
"October 7, 2019",This is a must visit when in London. Pick a rainy day and stay for a long time. The entrance is free. Audio device is 5£. We did not get any since they ran out of devices. The Egyptian and Persian section was fascinating. Particularly the Cyrus cylinder the king of Persian empire the first human rights declaration and replicas of Persepolis walls. If you are a museum buff half a day is the minimum time. ,One of the most comprehensive museums I've ever visited
"September 3, 2019","One of the most comprehensive museums I've ever visited. The museum is huge, you need 4 to 5 hours to explore every section. Their iconic glass dome is beautiful and put some artsy touch to the building.They have Egyptian mummies, modern artifacts, Easter Island's statue, you name it! Avoid weekend and holiday because it can get very crowded.",Loved it!
"September 2, 2019","You need 3 to 4 hours to enjoy this. All I can say is I could have spent 8 hours here. Take your time to ensure you do not miss anything that is on display. The history is outstanding . Very easy to get around, well laid out. ",Amazing 
"September 2, 2019",I am Greek and 50% of the museum has Greek art. You should return the sculptures back to Greece. Also there is art from other countries ,"Amazing exhibits, a must-see in London!"
"September 2, 2019","This was my first visit to the museum and I wish I could have stayed all day. We went mainly to see the Egyptian collection which didn’t disappoint but the other collections were very good as well. Amazing to see the Rosetta Stone in particular, that was the real highlight for me.",Worlds histories artefacts are to be found here
"September 2, 2019",Spacious museum with wonderful artefacts plenty of things on ancient Rome and Egypt but also from the Arabic world and wonder Asian cups made  of shells,Very exciting - as always

"September 1, 2019","It’s a great museum to visit because of their extensive collections, from Greek artifacts to Egyptian mummies. You can spend a whole day here if you visit everything but if they have listed the highlights if you have a very limited time. Best of all, entrance is free! Don’t get discouraged if you see a queue outside, it’s just for security check. ",World class museum
"September 1, 2019","Free admission to a hugely impressive building with fabulous roof to the Great Court.  With so much to see, August is definitely a month to avoid as its incredibly busy, but worth it.  Must sees include the rosetta stone, parthenon marbles, lewis chessmen, the Rothschild bequests and the egyptian mummies.",Great visit
"August 31, 2019","This place is huge and has so much history from mummies to the Rosetta Stone. It offers so much as each one of our kids had something on their list they wanted to see there. We didn’t have the whole day to spend there, but will have to go back next time we’re in London. ",Whole world under one roof!
"August 31, 2019",architecture from outside is impressive enough but inside much better. The representative photo is where you stay at entry. There were a lot of historical pieces also from Anatolia (Turkey) and Persia which of course interested me most. Also ancient Egypt was impressive. What i didn't like was there were too much restaurants inside and the open kitchen created a lot of smell. This can be solved in better way I think.,Absolutely amazing
"September 4, 2019","The British Museum is huge. I didn't have time to look round everything. There was a Roman section with statues of Roman Emperors, an Egyptian section, all different sections from different times in history. The antique jewellry was amazing. The building itself is an arcitectural masterpiece.",Ashurbanipal exhibition
"September 4, 2019","Superb, creative and innovative story telling brings this ancient civilisation to life! Lighting of displays was ingenious!",Wow! Something for everyone here.
"September 4, 2019","This is perhaps one of the best museums in the world. Free to enter and floors of exhibits (benefiting from years of British Colonial activities). My husband and I separated to look at our own areas of interest and were both blown away by the range and quality of exhibits. Set in a light airy build, easy distance from Russell Square or Holborn tube station, well worth a visit. ","""Manga "" and  Edvard Munch."
"September 4, 2019","Manga was a perfectly organized exhibition. I was imptressed by the introduction , as there were many info that I didn't know. I enjoyed the circular presentation of the artworks and I think it was a very good choice to have a red wall, to show the illustration better.",LONDON - The British Museum
"September 4, 2019","WELL WORTH THE ADMISSION FEE. Britain is steeped in History, from the Kings & Queens to Winston Churchill. Undefeated in 2 World Wars.",Amazing
"September 4, 2019",Just a whistle stop tour of 2hrs at the end of the day so only focused on Egypt and Greece but still amazing. The museum is vast and the main atrium is incredible. Will be going back to take in the rest soon.,Great Museum
"September 4, 2019","This is a very impressive museum, with amazing exhibits from all around the world.The main auditorium is very impressive if a little sparse.The gift shops were well stocked with high quality items.It would have got five stars but for the lack of seating in restaurant areas.",Stunning and Enormous
"September 4, 2019","Amazing works of art, including The Scream! The museum is physically stunning but it’s vastness is almost overwhelming. It’s a place you could easily spend several hours wandering through and leave knowing you missed a lot. If you enjoy art museums you should visit this one, it’s well worth it.","AMAZING, do not miss!!!"
"September 4, 2019",Anyone even remotely interested in history should check it out! I mean it’s free! You could spend days here looking at all the artifacts. I would very highly recommend checking it out and spend as much time as you feel compelled to!,One of the worlds must see museums 
"September 4, 2019","What an amazing place to spend a rainy day or indeed any day! We visited specifically for the Manga exhibition and so we skipped the queue as we had pre booked tickets. We have been many times before but always notice something new.  There are the most amazing artefacts around every corner. This time I was transfixed by the Mexican day of the dead papier-mâché statues and the sculptures from a Hindu temple.  My daughter really enjoyed the Manga temporary exhibition and it was an education for me as I know nothing about Manga or its history. The cafe is very expensive and not great so be warned, you will need some sustenance if museum foot kicks in (you know that slightly dead foot feeling you get in the 2nd hour of a museum visit)!

"September 4, 2019","This museum is very big, so give yourself time probabbly 5 to 6 hours going at a good pace. It has different shops, coffee shops, restaurants and bathrooms through out the building. Sundays is free entrance and you find lots of tourists and locals incoming from the time the museum opens. Very well put with permanent and itinerant exhibits.",One of the Best Museums
"September 4, 2019","The British Museum is one of the best museums I've visited. It is huge so plan no less than half a day so that you don't rush. There is simply a lot to take in. If you're visiting during the high tourist season, go as early in the day as you can to avoid as much of the crowd as you can. Ideally go after the summer season, although I understand there are still crowds, just not as overwhelming. The Museum is on our list when we go back. ",Could spend all day here
"September 4, 2019",There was a line for bag check but moves fast.  There so much to see I didn't cover it all in 3hrs.  I ate there & had an English Tea.  It was good plus as others said I considered it a donation since its free to see unless you want give 5 pound donation but I say save your money and eat there.  I didn't get a map but I should have gotten one because I wonder thru the same areas several times.   I some how missed the center of museum but enjoyed it alot.  Go see it,Absolutely amazing

"September 4, 2019","What an amazing collection of artifacts from almost every part of the world spanning almost all of time. You could spend days here and still not really take it all in.Everything is very well laid out and displayed with great detail, the write ups have a good amount of info without going into too much detail. It's just incredible how much is here, there truly is something for everyone. Though the circumstances of the appropriation of many things is questionable we are lucky that they did as much wouldn't have survived back where they came from and that it is all provided without an entry fee makes the history attainable to anyone who wants to see it.",Amazing artifacts
"September 3, 2019",Other than the fact that many of the most amazing artifacts were stolen from Egypt this place is full of amazing history. I’m sure Egypt is sorry they gave this all away for nothing but it is surely England’s gain.,Amazing Spectacle
"September 3, 2019",Amazing things to look at.  Leave hours to see it all (like 4-5 hours) especially with the crowds. Very eclectic selection AND it's free!!!!Was a little warm for this American in summer but not unbearable.,Something for everyone!

"September 22, 2019","After three hours, I thought I had seen everything but after I left, my son informed that I missed several important objects, including the Flood Tablet. Ugh! I went at 2pm on a Sunday and had to wait in line to get in. The museum closes at 5:30pm, except on Friday they stay open later. There was quite a crowd but not overwhelmingly so. Much more organized and pleasant than The Met in NYC. I enjoyed seeing the Rosetta Stone, The Royal Game of Ur, and the Astrolabe. Plenty of shopping with very nice trinkets and gifts. I will return again!",Must see

"September 22, 2019","My visit to the British Museum was to see the Rosetta Stone.  I was not disappointed!  Due to limited time available, I saw the highlights that were outlined in the official brochure.  The Assyrian Lion Hunt display was brilliant and I would say be sure to spend time looking at this remarkable piece of art work.  Highly recommend this museum.",Make a day of it
"September 22, 2019","We spent the day in London and decided to come here. We left our bags in the cloakroom, the charge was dependant on weight - is this a London thing??? It cost £7.50 for two bags.  There were lots of visitors present but as the building is so large no area was crowded.  The building was very clean. There are some sections that are free and others where there is a charge. We visited the areas without charge including the Egyptian mummies which was extremely fascinating. The shop we visited had a wide range of unique products including jewellery, crystals and soft furnishing. It was like an exhibition itself. I really feel you could spend the whole day here which is what we will do in the future. ",Must visit 
"September 21, 2019",It's very nice and historical but it is very crowded and noisy. Not very comfortable for people on the spectrum There should be some sort of wall isolation to fix that issue ,Always fun

"September 20, 2019","Housed vast collection of artefacts collected during the British Empire. I was particularly drawn to the Greek, Roman & Egypt collection. I was also surprised to see a Pompeii section. The internal circular architecture is impressive. ",Don't miss this
"September 20, 2019","We traveled in early September, after the summer rush and before college students arrived in London, so there were no lines and it wasn't over crowded. We spent about 3-1/2 hours there, but you could spend days. It is one of the world's big 4 museums. Don't miss this if you're in London.",Really neat interior architecture
"September 3, 2019","So i wasn't necessarily here for the exhibits. I was photographing the interior (just look at the ceiling!) with my brother and came up with some interesting patterns/compositions. Really liked it. I have only heard great reviews about the exhibits, so will have to visit this museum again for that next time.Well worth it.",Great family activity
"August 27, 2019","We did the British museum as our first excursion in London.  It didn’t disappoint.  It was very busy but there was a special queue for families with young children in prams.  There was also a superb children’s Centre with great changing facilities, lockers and a picnic area.  There wasn’t a baby feeding area but theChildren’s Centre was quiet and spacious enough to allow for this.The museum is also host to enough attractions for a wide audience of children ranging from teenagers to toddlers.Really well laid out to handle crowds and great for all ages.",Always worth visiting

"August 26, 2019","For those interested in archaeology, the British Museum will not disappoint. Here, there are the classical antiquities of that of Egypt and the ancient Near East as well as that of ancient Greece and Rome. There are also displays of indigenous civilizations from other parts of the world. This is a five-story building which has a varied souvenir shop and a small restaurant. This museum could rival that of the Pergamon Museum in Berlin and a half to full-day tour here would be recommended for groups of people.",Much too hot on a hot day
"August 26, 2019","We came to see The Rosetta Stone and the sides of the Parthenon. It has amazing artifacts, I must say. But amazingly it is not Air Conditioned!!! It was an amazing facility but it became an endurance contest to see how long you could last in the stifling heat, madeWorse By lack of air movement.",Popular place
"August 26, 2019","We got there 10 minutes before opening, so had a coffee. 10 minutes later a huge queue. But it moves fast. Museum itself is fascinating and lots of very helpful staff. We needed a wheelchair - free and easy to grab. Signage not brilliant so great having staff everywhere. Exhibits fantastic of course. But two hours brain not coping any more. Nice snacks available - on a hot day iced chocolate was wonderful.",A must see museum in London
"August 25, 2019","This is an amazing museum....its a must see even if you have a short stay in London. There was a long line when we got there on Sunday about noon.However the line moved fast...took us half hour to get in. First thing we did is get the museum guide. We then headed to the the Egypt section on 1st level. We saw the Rosetta stone, wrrtten in 3 languages about year 300BC. This is a stone has writings in three languages, hieroglyphics, ancient Egyptian, modern Egyptian and Greek. This stone writings allowed scientists decipher hieroglyphics. We saw the mummies, African, Ethiopian art and artifacts.Probably the best collection of artifacts and antiquities in the world.I highly recommend this museum if you're in London.It will be worth it if you rent the head phones which explain each of the artifacts.",Stunning! 
"August 25, 2019",Amazing building and loved looking around. The exhibitions were really good and fantastic value well worth the donation. A Must visit! ,Totally worth it
"August 25, 2019",Beautiful building with great exhibitions. Temporary exhibitions are kind of pricy but rest is free. A must when visiting London even if it's not for a long time.,British Museum - not just the Rosetta Stone
"August 25, 2019",The British Museum is where the Rosetta Stone is but there is a lot more in the Museum than the Stone.  There is a vast collection of antiquities. I suggest that you go on line and explore what's there before you go; that way you can plan what you want to see.  It can be absolutely overwhelming because of the depth and amount of objects.,Don’t miss! 
"August 25, 2019","The British Museum was not on my agenda when visiting London, however my 12 yr old daughter really wanted to go after seeing lots of recommendations on social media.  I was happy we gave in and went.  It’s a beautiful museum.  Just the building alone is awe inspiring. The exhibits are organized in a pleasing manner.  The museum is huge and there is no way you could see it all or even a fraction in a few hours.  We read up in the highlights and a few others my daughter wanted to see. We were there for about 3 hours.  We will definitely go back someday.  Getting in was easy.  There was a long security line, but it moved quite fast and efficiently.  It was crowded as was every single place we visited during our 6 day stay.  There were many tour groups.  My only peeve with the tour groups is that they crowd around an item with their guide and don’t move aside for others to see.  This is everywhere.  So annoying but not a reason to not visit this museum or any other sight. ",Wonders of the Wall
"August 18, 2019","I went here as ""something to do"" with a friend, his wife & 2 small children.It's a fantastic under-advertised attraction (I've lived in London all my 30yrs & had never heard of it).I enjoyed all the interactive aspects & learning all it had to offer do much I returned a month or so later with my father & partner.While there we heard announcements advertising the guided walk of the Wall. So we jumped @ the chance & Daddy & I enjoyed ourselves immensely. (Partner, less so tbph, but tyg, not his style).I would (& have) recommend visiting the museum to anyone looking for ""something to do"" with children & the Wall walk to any person interested in the history if London.",Amazing
"August 17, 2019","Possibly the best AND biggest museum I've ever been to. Amazing collection of historical items going through 7000+ years, all the continents and numerous cultures. I've been already twice and will go again.",Human history museum
"August 17, 2019","You can see ancient Egypt, Asean, Greece, Rome , etc. Recomended two  or three half day visits . It is intense and can get tired, a lor of stairs.The best The Rosetta Stone!!!","Wonderful Museum, too many people."
"August 17, 2019","Great collection of art and artifacts from all over the world, but in front of each piece there are always 25 people taking pictures. Ideally the museum sells admittance times other wise it is impossible to enjoy.",what an amazing experience
"August 17, 2019","We went there early morning on a rainy day, it turned out such a nice place to visit even though it was really crowded.",Voyage in the past
"August 17, 2019","Fantastic as usual, the British museum is one of the biggest museums and it’s free, a MUST to learn history and get full immersion in the past",Great collection of unique treasures
"August 17, 2019","Huge museum, we only saw a part of it, including the Greek-Roman and Cypriot collection, the Egyptian one and of course the Marbles of Parthenon. World wide legacy antiquities require our fully attention and respect. I would definitely  pay another visit next time I am in London and I strongly recommend it to everyone visiting London.",Breath taking
"August 17, 2019","A place  which connects times , and in which u can find and learn so many  interesting thinks , I would come back :)",ancient treasures badly displayed
"August 17, 2019","Amazing museum with pivotal ancient treasures, definitely not to miss!! free entry really appreciatedunfortunely the different sections and paths are very badly organised, all pieces are piled up one on the other and no one really valued! really a pity",Worth a visit 
"August 16, 2019",If you enjoy history then this is the place for you. So many wonderful exhibits! Wish we had had more time to spend there. The exhibits on Assyria & Mesopotamia were quite fascinating. Check out their website for a list of all their exhibits - too many to mention in the review. ,Amazing!
"August 7, 2019",Free museum! Just say yes. If you love mummies and world history this is the museum for you. You could spend an entire day here but I recommend at least 3 hours. Bring water. You can't bring food or drink into the exhibits but you can always refill a bottle at the water fountain. The food is expensive but it was tasty.,Visit the Mummies
"August 7, 2019",Awesome showcase of antiquities from all over the world.This is a real treasure trove! I can spend all day there.,History of the world in 100 objects!
"August 7, 2019","The collection is so vast -- and they do an excellent job of presenting everything.  There is something for everyone (all ages, all interests).  If you get tired of reading, you can do a ""hands on"" experience (the money room offered one of these).  Or, take one of the ""pop up"" tours (given by volunteers) -- check with the information desk near the entrance.  Or, if you have time, do one of the extensive audio tours.  I spent 2 full days here, and could easily spend two weeks without getting tired!  (By the way, entrance is free!!! -- but they do encourage a modest contribution to allay costs..)",It’s a must
"August 7, 2019","If you visit London, The British Museum must definitely be on your to-do list. It’ s amazing how many things from all over the world you can see.",The largest museum in the world
"August 7, 2019",Probably the largest museum in the world. One needs at least a week for visiting the important galleries.,Beautiful museum
"August 7, 2019",The museum is a must when visiting London. We went on a Sunday and the the lines were not too bad. The exhibits are fascinating and well organized. The central area of the museum gets quite crowded so be prepared.,Great Afternoon Outing
"August 7, 2019","Fun looking through the history and art of UK.  The museum was very busy but that was ok.  Staff very helpful, you could disappear inside the museum for days.  So much to see ",Too popular for its own good
"August 7, 2019",So difficult to get in.. what are all these people doing? The displays lack information.. I went to see the Solomon show.. disappointed.. saw more in the main exhibit in the big hall. The Chinese gallery now has removed the fabulous Burmese and Thai and Sri Lankan.. oh I know the excuses.I could go on.. so sad . The BM was 40 years ago a wonder house.not any more,Wonderful collection of artefacts
"August 6, 2019",Spent a couple of hours and probably only covered half the museum. I love history and classics and this was just the job. Lovely ambience but navigating between the exhibits can be a challenge. Recommend taking the map so you know where you want to go. Lovely cafe in the old reading room area.,British museum
"August 6, 2019",We have been to the British museum every time we go toLondon as t is one of our favourites. This time we decided to skip the Elgin marbles and Egyptian section. The regular collection is quite interesting and we had a wonderful time.,Excellent special exhibitions -- Munch (last days) and Rembrandt -- Good accessibility
"August 11, 2019",This is a substantial museum with a major collection and excellent temporary exhibits.  It is also easy to access for disabled people.  There are reserved parking spaces and a ramp at the entrance.  Lifts to upper floors.,Amazing museum and free
"August 11, 2019","Wow this museum is amazing. Now it’s not as big as the Louvre in Paris, but this will take you at least half a day to look through everything, plus it’s FREE. Clean and if you come in the morning, you can avoid the crowds.",A visit to learn
"August 11, 2019",It was so interesting to visit the museum. You can see and learn a lot. But you need to go to the museum earlier as it takes some time to enter. Keep in mind that it takes a whole day to examine every exhibition,Not worth it
"August 10, 2019","It was the hottest day of the summer in London so we decided to find activities that had air conditioning. The British Museum seemed to be a good choice.  I lasted all of 10 minutes and had to call it a day. Firstly, the museum seemed sort of run down although it was hard to see much given the seemingly hundreds of tour groups traipsing through the museum which was the second problem.  There were so many tour groups that it was impossible to see any of the displays and difficult to walk around the museum. The attractions weren't impressive enough to make it worth dealing with the crowds so I would skip this one. ",Manga exhibition!
"August 10, 2019","Visited the British Museum for the manga exhibition and an exclusive showing of studio Ghibli’s the wind rises! We spent the whole day going round the manga exhibition and exploring the other areas of the museum, took us all day! Such a great day out for families and couples, would definitely recommended going! We did have to pay for the manga exhibition meaning we skipped the security bag queue which was ridiculously long so make sure you arrive early! ",A must see
"August 9, 2019","This is of course amazing, but please consider putting some sort of traffic direction on the Rosetta Stone as they do, for example,  at the Tower for the Crown Jewels; at the moment, it's impossible to view it in any detail without hords of  photo-snapping ****** getting in the way. On that topic, I was gobsmacked to see someone get excited about a stunning piece, but rather than look at it 'in the flesh', they took a photo and then showed that to hs friend and then got excited about the image!! ",Fabulous - but don't go on a rainy day in the tourist season!
"August 9, 2019","I have lost count of the number of times I've spent many hours at a time at the British Museum and there is still more to see. It is a wonderful repository of international history which is truly awesome. However, I would advise avoiding busy times if possible.On my last visit it was a very wet day and I felt the museum was very overcrowded - it was completely impossible to see the Rosetta Stone for example! People posing for photos and the use of selfie-sticks didn't help.The number of visitors also meant huge queues for food, drink and the shop. Nevertheless it is an absolute must for Londoners, UK visitors and overseas visitors. Fabulous!",3rd floor in The British Museum
"August 9, 2019",Ir is so wide show of human history and also contemporary items that one could use days in this venue. I focused this time to 3rd floor only - seeing the times fron ancient Egypt and Mesopotania to European Enlightment. Free entry is making this a very popular venue to visit.,Travel the world and back in time 
"August 9, 2019","I arrived at the museum at 11:30, only an hour and a half after opening and the museum was already packed as you would expect. There was a helpful member of staff at the main entrance towards the back of a rather long entry queue who said it would be quicker to get into the building via the back entrance-this is on Montague Place. It appeared the main reason for queuing was for bag checks though no bags were looked through so everyone just went right in. I would recommend taking a free map of the building and firstly scouting for your preferred areas of interest. You could quite easily spend several days here and still not have seen everything so find what you most want to check out and then look at everything at a leisurely pace. I did not do a tour on this occasion but this may be something I do in the future as I am sure it would allow for more of the museum to be seen in a day. I was here for several hours enjoying the permanent pieces and free exhibits. There were some areas which felt a lot like a sauna. Unfortunately the only option for cool air were some large fans in the corner of rooms and with the amount of people there as you can imagine, especially on a hot day in August it was necessary to take a few breaks standing in front of the fans. My favourite sections were all the rooms about east Asia (so much ceramic), the Middle East including Ancient Egypt and Prints and Drawings. Don’t forget to check out the King’s Library. I enjoyed the free exhibitions about Captain James Cook and his voyages. This closed on 4th August 2019. I would highly recommend the museum to anyone who loves to learn about history, art, different cultures and loves jewellery- there was plenty to see. One tip- take plenty of water.  Another visit in the pipeline to explore more of what was missed. ",Amazing visit!!!
"August 8, 2019",Had such an incredible day with my daughter. We walked our socks off all over the museum and were sad when they actually closed and kicked us out lolThe investigation exhibit was absolutely incredible- we spent 2 hours in there alone. Go into the garden and have a peek at the plants and pond! Beautiful. Food is overpriced which was expected but would recommend packed lunch if you don’t want to spend your pay check on chocolate brownies and lattes!!Can’t wait to go again!,Very Interesting
"August 4, 2019",A must-see location. This museum has many artifacts that will have an interest for a vast audience. The culture is never-ending and is a great insight into ancient history.,Cultural visit
"August 4, 2019","It's free and an amazing Museum GO NOW trust me 😊 The lobby just makes you feel welcomed, you could skip all and just stay there enjoying some coffee",Wow
"August 3, 2019",Totally stunning and endless collections of artifacts and original works from all over the globe and all through human history. Amazing.,British  Museum
"August 2, 2019",You need many days for seeing all the Museum. It is spectacular. The room of the mummies is the best.,The Best
"August 1, 2019",What ever angle of history you're interested in YOU MUST GO Here. Give yourself lots of time or plan your walk well. Too much to see in one attempt,Fun for all ages
"August 1, 2019",This was the first time I had been to the British museum in over 10 years and also my first since starting a family. We were not disappointed! any museum/gallery can be a tricky thing with young kids but I would thoroughly recommend this one.,Typically British understatement 
"July 31, 2019","A very hot July day, unusually hot so I hoped for some respite inside the museum, however it was very hot and staff warned visitors to take water.A fantastic display of artefacts, I suggest investing in the audio guide if it’s the first time o have visited the must.Well stocked gift shop and nice teashops.A must while in London.",Challenging
"July 31, 2019","Possibly a victim of its own success. The place was overcrowded which made it difficult to move around and keep together as a group. The displays and content were very interesting however, spending time at most spots was difficult due to being swept along in the flow of visitors. We had to cut our visit short because of the crowing and difficulty moving about. Groups of visitors, including school groups, were sitting on the concourse floor and on stairs, again making access and movement problematic. There seemed to be as many people sitting and taking a break as there were attempting to navigate around them. We would have liked to have stayed longer and seen more but it proved too difficult. We had a person with a disability in our group and they found it very difficult to cope. I witnessed rude and inconsiderate behaviours between visitors barging, pushing and shoving. Families with younger children and buggies also appeared to be struggling. What a pity that such a treasured resource should be reduced to a combination of a January sales rush and the Tube at rush hour.Prepare for battle...............",All that missing stuff
"July 31, 2019","So there was all the stuff missing from all of the other museums around the world. We spent two hours in the museum just in the Egyptian, Assyrian, and Greek collections. A very good display of a small selection of the huge collection and even something as important as the Rosetta Stone didn’t disappoint. The museum could have gone on for days but it was laid out in a way that was manageable and not overwhelming. If we had time there are so many more areas to see, we just didn’t want to spend all day there. I would certainly go back for the Asian collection alone. The Elgin Marbles were amazing too, how awesome would a fully intact Parthenon look?!","Amazing Museum, but not on a hot July day"
"July 30, 2019","One of the world's great museums no doubt. So much to see and such great examples of everything. Purchase terrific map which shows how to get to highlight items. But be forewarned, everyone else in museum also has a copy. Or perhaps they just don't have somewhere else to go, because there were SO MANY people in many galleries that it was impossible to move. The Elgin Marbles were mobbed. The Rosetta stone was barely visible between the hundreds of craning heads. The Egyptian galleries were packed and hot enough to be in Cairo. The ancient Britain galleries were actually quite comfortable and not as crowded.I don't think I would have missed visiting even if I had known how hot and how crowded it would be, but try to plan to visit when more children might be in school and fewer visitors in town, if you wish to take your time and see many of the items.",Exceptional but not British...
"July 30, 2019",There is no doubt that the British museum is an exceptional one but there is not a variety of exhibitions about Britain's history.  Most of the exhibitions are from Greece and Egypt . In general the museum is big and there is no entrance fee. You can donate an amount of money if you'd like. ,Best Museum
"July 30, 2019",Absolutely amazing museum!  You can't go to London with a stop here!  Treasures from all over the world!,Enjoyed - long overdue
"July 30, 2019","Despite 10 plus visits to London, never had the time to visit the British museum. Nice place to spend 3-4 hours - good central place to view things found in museums of Greece, Egypt and Rome. Suggest you focus on 10 most important items first and if you are not tired of walking approach other exhibits.",History of whole world is in your hands
"July 30, 2019",The museum is huge - it will take a week to see everything - history of whole world is in your hands. The upper floors are narrower and overcrowded. Gift-shops has a great selection of souvenirs and gifts. Admission is free.,Always a delight!
"July 30, 2019","This museum never fails to delight and astonish. We love the written descriptions of each exhibit that are missing in other places such as the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The only failure is the cafes lack any gluten free options and for drinks, there is no such thing as an ice cube in ",Manga Exhibition
"July 30, 2019","After a full day in London, my partner and I ventured to the British Museum to take a look at their manga exhibition and what it has to offer. As an avid manga reader, I was excited to see what they have in store for us. From the start straight to the finish this was jam-packed with everything manga to the origin story of manga to modern-day production and the top mangas at the moment. I will highly recommend this to anyone who reads manga as you can spend a while in here reading all the information they have to offer.",Incredible museum with about a week's worth of stuff!
"July 29, 2019",We did the highlights tour as that was all we had time for. The highlights tour is very recommended--it gives you insider knowledge and appreciation of about 10-12 different items around the museum. I could come back and visit this museum every day for an entire week. Maybe I will have to do just that!,Probably the best museum in the world
"July 29, 2019","This is probably the best museum in the world. It's sheer scale rivals that of the Louvre but it is much easier to get around, much better designed and free for everyone to enter!It's worth noting that the BM (in the past) has been accused of acquiring its collections using less than legal methods, so a moral question remains of whether to support the institution. ",My Favorite Museum 
"July 29, 2019",What a treat: a free Museum of international acclaim.I headed to the Egyptian displays on 2 floors and could have spent a week looking at everything.Do not miss going to the museum.,The history of the Western World under one roof
"July 29, 2019","Loved this museum, massive collections, the Rosetta Stone is a must see, fantastic objects, well presented","A Great, Nearly Overwhelming Adventure"
"July 26, 2019","The British Museum is a comprehensive experience offering a widely diverse exposure to historic cultural artifacts and displays. You could easily spend a week here and fail to see all that is essential. Use the map to get the highlights. If you are in a hurry, but want a “condensed version” - make tour way to the King George III Library. You get an exposure to sculpture, manuscripts, art, and history in a beautiful, quick setting. By all means, take the time to do it right!  But if you just can’t, visit the Kings Library at a minimum. And if you do have time, enjoy afternoon tea upstairs!",Very interessing museum 
"July 26, 2019",Impressive museum in which you can learn a lot about culture and human nature. The children realy enjoyed our stay for more than two hours yesterday! ,It’s free! 
"July 25, 2019",You can spend the whole day there and still not be able to see everything. It’s very busy so get there early as possible! ,Excellent museum
"July 24, 2019",It's helpful to get an audio guide to access the tours of the major pieces in the museum.  Unfortunately it was very crowded when I visited in July so was only able to see the major pieces of art.  Also the cafe in the main area is very good.,It's a museum
"July 24, 2019","So it's one of the greatest museums in the world, but it's still a museum. Lots of walking, lots of crowds, pushing to see, etc. I loved museums as a kid, but these days, my electrate tastes demand more (bells and whistles? interactivity?) There's a long security line in front, so be prepared. It's free, but I'm sure that the audio guide would be worth it to provide some of the context that I was missing (guided tours are also available, both from the museum and from independent guides). If it were just me, I'd give it a 3*, but I know it has cultural treasures, so reluctantly pushing it up to 4.",Intriguing museum
"July 24, 2019","Free admission, however, you can donate to them. Roughly 5 floors of different eras including Europe, Asia, Egyptian, Greece and Roman (to name a few!)It’s worth a look and you can certainly stay in there hours on end! ",Just too much to see!
"July 24, 2019","Enjoyed our time here, but so much to see and so little time. The cast Museum was pretty spectacular. Saw my ancestor Isabella of Angoleme  here. Was stoked!!  Was saddened by the stripping of the marbles and the Assyrian artifacts. ",A Must Visit
"July 24, 2019",Whether you live in London or are simply passing by this place is a must visit. Best day to visit would be on a Sunday.,Need a whole day to make the most of it!
"July 23, 2019","This museum is great, there are so many artefacts that it’s hard to keep track of what you’ve seen and what you haven’t. Would recommend for anyone visiting London!",Busy
"July 23, 2019","Had brief visit, mainly for the Egyptian treasures. So busy had to view closely as too many people! Next time will choose term-time when hopefully not so many tourists ",I like to visit museum

"July 22, 2019","My adult son and I spent a very pleasant late afternoon here, both looking at exhibits and enjoying the cafe. Most memorable is the beautiful enclosed courtyard. As many others must mention, note there is not much indigenous to Britain itself. Still a great collection and worth your time.",Plenty to see
"July 22, 2019","Had a lovely time visiting this museum. They had alot of things to see and I enjoyed it. If visiting, spend the whole day and you can walk around","Go with a plan, and it will be great."
"July 22, 2019","You should definitely figure out what you're interested in at the British Museum before you go. It is a massive museum and you'll be over it after about an hour or two, so pick out the exhibits you want to see and do them first! For example, I wanted to see the Rosetta Stone first. I suggest going at off-peak times because people are everywhere and it is really packed.",Amazingness never ends and jaw-dropping exhibition in every section!
"July 22, 2019","Was staying in a hostel right next to the museum, making it super convenient to visit the place from time to time. Not only that I enjoy the in-door exhibitions a lot, but I was also amazed by the outdoor exhibition activities during the weekend. The only pity was that I never get to finish going through all exhibition rooms... There are simply too many to see!",Make a selection before you go in
"July 22, 2019",With over 8 million pieces it's impossible to see all of it. My advise for a half day visit would be to select one section. I selected the Egyptian section and was surprised at the amount of statues that you can get close to without any glass encasing. Some top pieces are protected but most are very open. Entering the museum was quick even though nowadays there is a security check. The entrance is free. Donations are welcomed. Tip if you want to fast-track; buy a ticket to special exposition and you have a shorter line to get in on busy days.,Just awesome 
"July 22, 2019"," Came primarily to see the Rosetta Stone, but then got absorbed by the Greek, Roman, Egyptian wing as a whole, just wonderful.There was a pamphlet justifying the holding for part of the Freise from the Parthenon as the Greek Govt are claiming it back, and we found their reasoning a little weak and self serving.Only other downside was the huge number of people attending but that is to be expected, just take your time and go with the flow.",Spent a memorable day at the British Museum
"July 22, 2019",Had an amazing day just wondering through the museum. No planning and just a walkthrough. Went to see the special Edvard Munch exhibit and it was so nice to see the SCREAM.,"If you love history, this place is best to find out more"
"July 21, 2019","I am honestly not a mueseum person.Hence , not much comments. Well maintained place. Lot of places to eat inside. Lot of benches to sit and take rest for a while. Guides to explain. Washroom on all floors.Helpful and courteous staff.",Great family day out
"July 21, 2019",Museum quickly got us through security check. For a Sunday it was relatively quiet and we went straight into the specialist exhibitions. Manga - Great stuff we all enjoyed. By 2pm it was busy but the catering served us quickly and food was excellent. Engaged staff who were very helpful. Got tickets to see another exhibition and afterwards went and looked round Japan exhibits. All really interesting. Exhibit rooms nicely cooled on a warm day. Left at closing time having had a great day.,Really nice meal in the museum restaurant.
"July 11, 2019",Top quality beetroot and monkfish risotto.Love the big glass ceiling. Blew my mind to find out that each piece of glass is individual. No two are the same!,Fast fee and easy to see.  Daughter loved Rosetta Stone
"July 11, 2019",We arrived at 10:15 on a weekday at the Montague entrance. Waited about 15 minutes behind a couple of groups - moved fast. Great to arrive at that hour - grade straight tonRosetta Stone.  Museum Map is great in pointing out “must sees” if you have 1 hr or 2 hrs. ,Interesting
"July 10, 2019","Loved it. Not completely organized as one would expect (sometimes just a little confusing). Tons of people checking out the Egypt colletion, other parts not so crowded. Beutiful museum, I just wish people took a little more time watching the exibition, reading about it and not be taking soooo many pictures all the tim",Amazing and Free
"July 10, 2019","We were told not to my the British Museum during our first trip to London and it was great advice.  The place is huge and I could easily spend several days in here.  The Lobby is breathtaking.  We had three kids of different ages and each one of them got to do an activity which the other kids enjoyed and was very informative.  The staff members were very friendly with the children and helped them figure the activity they wanted to participate in.  I cannot believe the amount of artifacts and all for the public to enjoy for free.  There are donation boxes and we felt it was worth giving to this institute.  We did go early in the morning and were in without any waiting, however on our way out we did notice that there was a line.  This is a fun place and well worth the visit.  ",Very good
"July 10, 2019","This place is very interesting, however on our visit i think every school in the local area visited too!The exhibits are very good, definitely worth a visit!",Fantastic Museum
"July 10, 2019","From start to finish, an excellent museum to see!  Entrance is free and there are programs you can donate a couple pounds to have.  I found the programs super helpful - there are suggestions of the top highlights to see which guided me and I was able to see them all!  The map is easy to navigate and the museum is so well labelled that I had no difficulty making my way through the museum.  From the Egyptian collection to the Rosetta stone and the Japanese Gallery, there is something for everyone.  A must see when going to London!",One of the Worlds best museums
"July 9, 2019","One of the Worlds best museums, a must see location, fantastic content through multi-periods, very busy in high season.",British Museum 
"July 9, 2019",Friendly staff. So many different collections that are worth visiting. The standard collection is free to visit. ,"Great museum, wonderful artifacts"
"July 9, 2019","We visited in March. Entry to the British Museum is free, though they will accept donations. When we arrived, the line was long to enter, but after someone incorrectly directed us to a second side entry that was not open, the staff at the entrance more than made up for it by directing us through the member line (a quick walk in and done). Get a map when you enter. The first item of note when you enter is the famed Rosetta Stone. Once in the center rotunda, there are three or four floors with wings off each floor for displays, for all periods of history. The sections on Egyptian, Assyrian, and other ancient cultures are outstanding, and there is so much more. The biggest regret I have is not being able to go back for the several days it would take to take it all in. Food is available in the center rotunda. Great way to spend a day (or more).",British Museum
"July 9, 2019",Absolutely loved it! So much to see and do! Could spend a few days there!!! Several floors divided by time period and genre. Definitely recommend for the family. Something for everyone,Great at night time 
"February 16, 2020",As pass holders we didn’t need to queue but at 8pm the queue is minimal anyway. Took my 4 year old up and he loved it. A great view over London at night with the lights shining. Definitely worth it ,Views of London
"February 22, 2020",The London Eye is good for viewing the skyline of London but the length of the queues makes it almost not worth it. Getting a few pictures of the Eye itself from a distance is great but it's really just a once off trip. Consider investing in the fast pass of it's busy or you may spend more time in line than on the Eye.,6 stars
"March 20, 2020","I would give six stars if I could! I booked fast track for an evening view of London, and I was not disappointed. While fast track did cost more, me and my boyfriend were straight past the long line, searched and into a pod within six minutes of arriving. Well worth the extra money in my opinion. But the views? Simply breathtaking. Seriously, the pictures and videos don't do justice. It's so peaceful being that high up, yet you see the city still bustling below. The pod has so many clear windows for excellent photo opportunities and is spacious enough for many people inside without feeling claustrophobic. The pace was just right and not once did I feel uncomfortable. I've seen people saying this is a ""tourist trap"", but I couldn't disagree more. As a Brit myself, I can't recommend you do this attraction enough and hopefully it will shine a light onto why I'm raving about it so much.  A truly unforgettable, spectacular experience.",View in the sky
"February 27, 2020","Surprised how quick we accessed the Eye.  We were booked in at 4.30pm and had arrived early because of possible queues but got on the ride within 5 minutes and had actually finished our rotation before our allotted time.Superb views over the city, so many sights to try and identify.  The Eye will always be a popular tourist attraction, next time I want to see the city by night.","The Shard has better views, but this is a great attraction"
"December 1, 2021","Had an enjoyable dusk/night time ride on the London Eye. The queue moved slowly as not all pods were being loaded, plus you have to navigate the usual Merlin green screen photo opp, but once on board it was a great experience. Not too many people in the pod, although not much in the way of mask wearing. The views were spectacular. Highly recommend a night time ride but probably not for your first/only ride because it can be difficult to pinpoint specific landmarks as it's a carpet of lights below (which is truly spectacular). No problem with glare or visibility and taking photos even with my smartphone was easy.The ride itself is beautiful - you can tell it was a passion project for the architects. Even though it's been beaten in terms of height, it's still the most beautiful. It's extremely smooth, and you can't feel when it starts/stops to load disabled people.I feel the Shard offers far better views (it's almost surreal looking down on London Bridge) plus not time-limited like the London Eye is, however the London Eye is still great, easy to do and a great icon for London.",Nice family flight
"February 18, 2023","It is what it is.  A big Ferris style wheel above London.  The organisation here is at least well polished and professional (compared to, well, nearly everything else we did this week) and you feel safe and secure.  We had a 5:45pm slot, which was the last slot of the day and as a result the man loading the pods placed out family of five in our own pod.  This made for a really special time as a family enjoying the flight and views of London and allowed a nice calm chilled experience.  I would definitely recommend booking later on in the day as when we arrived at the Southbank around 10am it looked fairly busy then.",Amazing views
"February 26, 2020",Such a unique experience. Costly but worth every bit. The movement of the eye is slow and steady so your elevation is not a sudden jarring one. Fortunately we had a clear afternoon with little wind so there were no disappointments with our ability to see the view. Easy to book online (we booked before our trip to ensure a spot because it was half term in London) and fast check in. Photo opportunity at the start of the ride and a great souvenir at the end. Each compartment contains around 15 guests so you don’t feel claustrophobic. Truly a fantastic experience.,London Eye
"March 1, 2020","Went on the London Eye on Friday as part of a school trip. Participated in a workshop in the pod as we went round.  Great thanks goes to Will, who was one of the Eye’s workshop leaders. He took time with the students, engaging their attention, and bringing the experience to life. I’d really recommend this experience.","Nice, but for the price I preferred The Shard"
"January 16, 2020","The London Eye became famous after the entry in the new millennium, and stayed after its success, for years to come (while we visit, it's celebrating its 20th anniversary).The views are very good, but you'll find more or less the same impact in the Tate Modern museum, which is free, or the top of the dome in St.Paul's Cathedral.Also, the queues can be huge, and if you choose fast track, then the price is not worthwhile. I would prefer to pay more to go to the top of The Shard, which at least gives you a unique perspective, and where you can stay as long as you want while drinking and sitting.The wheel will rotate only once for about 30 minutes. that's it.I'll let you decide for yourself, of course, but take into account the alternatives.","Disappointing experience, great view "
"February 19, 2020","London Eye delivers the view it promises; however it’s very disorganised. We purchased our tickets via website, with the binoculars. The queue has groups, families and general public all mixed up. We had a group of 30+ people skipping the line numerous times. Our binoculars were not given to us, and we realised this when we were ready to board the cabin. When we asked for the binoculars, we were told they are given at the entrance (where the person admitting us never told us) and that we should  “try get the ladies attention” so she handed it over to us. When we complained the experience was being terrible, we were just told “so sorry. Please step to the side” and there we were left trying to get the binoculars lady attention.With the groups, our kids were constantly bumped into and walked over. Very disappointed q the overall experience. ",Incredible Displays
"July 9, 2019",There is far too much to see in one day.  To view everything would probably take at least 3 days.  Check their web site before you go to see what's on display and then prioritize the area(s) that you are most interested in.  It's well worth spending a day there and is something that you don't want to miss.,Greatest Museum!!
"July 9, 2019","You will need lots of time to view it all, book more than one day if you like history, 03 at least :)",Overwhelming 
"July 9, 2019",You need several visits to even scratch the surface. The finest collection of antiquity we’ve ever seen. ,A must see
"July 9, 2019",Marvellous building and marvellous exhibits.Well worth going to however short you London visit.Lovely part of London.,Can't Miss
"July 9, 2019","When in London, don't forget to visit the British Museum. I had fun touring the place when I was on holiday there .It's free and they have a huge collection of permanent artworks so you can take selfies alongside them if you like. I was there before lunchtime and there's not a lot of tourists yet. If you love art, you can't miss this.",The British Museum is great but not in all in one go
"July 8, 2019","Like many Londoners,  I have dragged my children or rather been dragged by them around most of London's museums. Especially this one, the grandest of them all. And it's a bloody marathon. I learned long ago to decide in advance what to see and get in and get out without being distracted. Now my kids are adults and I have a granddaughter. And one day I shall show her my favourite place in the entire museum where we can sit and enjoy a relaxed lunch - the peaceful room housing the Elgin Marbles. If you don't have time or this is your first visit please pace yourself. Ideally, it's better to remember the exhibits than the slog. ",Very rice history 
"July 8, 2019",As expected it is a place to learn about all the world history and civilisations. You cannot cover it fully in one visit .. so bug and have hundreds of items. Free to access which was great thing. Some items and it's descriptions were hard to match. , A very good  experience 
"July 8, 2019",We went to this museum  to look at the history for fun.  We were desperate to see Mummy  because  it was shown on the films. We also like the section on Greece because  of the story of Tory.  The section of China was a little bit boring. The area on the section of Solomon  island  and Syria  were very hot so we could  not stay long. You couldn't  finish it in one day if you were lover of history. There was no entrance  fee so that you could come again and again .,Ye olde mummies of London
"July 8, 2019","We felt that we had to come to the British Museum when in London. The map has a very handy key code of ""items not to miss"". This really helped us as it is so big we wouldn't have been able to bring the kids to each exhibit. There are some really fascinating exhibits here - particularly the Egyptian section. But I just couldn't get away from the fact that I felt they should be in Cairo. I didn't think that I would feel that strongly before going - but lots of the items just feel out of place in the ""British"" museum. However - it is still a great place to visit",Historical Artifacts Galore
"July 8, 2019","If you like history, this museum has amazing artifacts from many civilizations and eras.  It’s free!  Definitely purchase a map and hit the highlights if you are in London.  You cannot go through it all in one day - information overload.  It is an amazing museum!",Great VIEWS
"February 21, 2020",Perfect place to see all of London. Coca Cola did it right. The pods are deceiving from pictures. They actually fit upward to 20+ people in them. Line ups are quick and the entire adventure took 45-50 minutes. Kids loved it!,Great views of London 
"February 26, 2022","We are visiting London for the half term break, we used the coupons off the Christmas selection boxes which allows children on free.. we absolutely loved it, first timers so wasn’t sure what to expect but we all were amazed at the views. Only down side was the queue, he had booked to be on at 4pm it was about 4:30 by the time we reached the front, luckily it wasn’t raining but we did enjoyed it ",WOW! What a view.
"March 17, 2022","All I'm going to say is I can tell why it's such a big tourist attraction, defiantly worth the journey to go and see it in person, it's amazing to watch at night too. When I went on the eye the skies were blue so I got some good views of the city. I could see Buckingham palace from the top!- Great experience.",Commemorative Mugs Are Poor Quality
"August 2, 2023","I enjoy visiting the London Eye when I am in London and their views are lovely.However, during my latest visit in June 2023, I purchased 3 commemorative mugs. I have several generations of the mugs and these ones are simply poor quality. After just one wash, the mug is chipped and ceramic embossed design cracking.I contacted the Guest Services over a month ago and they are incredibly slow to respond. Each email has had a 5-10 day lag in between.They offered to send a new mug, which was appreciated, but can’t send to an international destination (only UK and some Europe). I opted to have one mug sent to a European address for forwarding but wanted to purchase another mug so it wasn’t a dreadfully expensive exercise. They simply have no means of any remote purchasing and can only offer a refund. We reached this point after a month or so of discussion.Terrible product, terrible customer service. Incredibly disappoints.",Naked Eye of Attraction
"July 22, 2022","Based in the heart of London, South Bank, if you've never been to London, I would recommend the opportunity to see it from a different perspective. Slowly travelling up the wheel, taking over an hour to complete a 360, this iconic feature allows many to absorb and admire London today. The pods have a central seating area, so should you get tried at any stage, you are more than welcome to rest your feet before popping back up to gaze over the city once you reach the peak.Unlike many wheel go rounds and rides, this tourist attraction essentially never stops moving. As a result, visitors are advised to to hop on (and off when you leave) promptly to avoid missing your booth. The continuous rotation also means when you are securely locked in, one can experience a seamlessly smooth ride climbing up 443 feet.If you have a fear of height, I can only say depending on your anxiety, that you are safe from falling. And because you are safely locked in, I would suggest you not go if you are highly likely of a panic attack. Having that said, regardless, this is an attraction not to miss out on and you can always stay in the centre of the pod when you feel a little light headed.","Pub pod @ The London Eye, absolutely amazing"
"December 3, 2021","I just had to come & review our experience on Sunday 28th November. We booked the pub pod experience at 3pm. We were asked to arrive 15mins beforehand & were directed inside to the bookings office to the VIP desk. On arrival we were met by 3 friendly members of staff. We were given a goody bag & asked to take a seat while we waited for the pod to come round. The staff were all so friendly & chatted to us while we waited. When it was time to go, Arnie led us to the front of the queue & after a few minutes the pod arrived. It was decorated with a Christmas theme & it looked fantastic. We were given a passion fruit martini, which was lovely. There was two of us plus another 3 people in the pod, it was great to have room to move around freely & take some amazing pics. Arnie pointed out landmarks, took pictures & really made the whole experience great for us. I cannot rave about him enough, he was fab. 😊Then we had another drink, absolut passion fruit vodka & lemonade. Again this was lovely.The whole 30 minutes was full of laughing & chatting & I dont think it could have been any better. Thank you to the whole team for a great time & especially to Arnie. We will definitely be back for more pod themes.",Enjoyable
"February 21, 2020",We have Merlin premium passes and pre-booked a slot for £1. We were able to use the fast pass qqueue though both queues moved quickly. Great views on a reasonably cloudy day and we all enjoyed it. Visited the 4d cinema after which was ok too. Next to Sealife and Shrek so ideal for Merlin pass holders ,Well Maintained 
"February 10, 2020",Not the best view in London and a bit of a tourist trap. The area around the eye is dirty and busy. The eye itself is well managed and maintained but better views can be obtained free in Parliament Hill and Royal Greenwich Park or head to Monument it St. Paul’s for good views of the city.The Eye is managed by Merlin Group and is over commercialised so expect theme park up sells of ride photos and loads of Coke branding everywhere. ,Overpriced Save your Money
"February 16, 2020",Where to start?? Massive queues so paid £40 each for fast track. One revolution of the London skyline over the Thames in a pod full of people!! If you want to treat your partner bring them to bar one instead for food and drinks because that’s at least reasonably priced and you get something for your money. The reason it’s even getting the 1 star is the 4D experience was entertaining ,A Special Experience
"March 7, 2020","I do not like ferris wheels.  I don't do well with heights.  But this was something different.  First of all, buy your tickets ahead of time.  We ordered online for a specific time and had no problem getting onto the ride.  Each capsule is closed, with a wide bench in the middle for those who wish to sit.  There is a railing all around the inside for those who stand. The wheel movers verrrrry slowly.  it took over 40 minutes to go around.  So I didn't feel fear and actually enjoyed the scenery.  it was a clear evening and you could see all of London from the Eye.  There is a also a short film about the Eye and the places you can recognize from above.  Truly a positive experience. ",Well worth it for the wonderful city views
"December 16, 2023","It was a grey November morning and being ""off peak"" season, the queues were not very long and the process was flawless. I found the ticket price hefty at around 40 quid, especially when compared to the ZAR, however it was a wonderful experience and the first time I've seen London from that vantage point. It put the city's lay out into perspective and as one who has travelled London largely on the Underground, I loved seeing the above-ground view. Well worth it for the wonderful city views. The audio commentary also gives some nice tidbits of info and points out some of the landmark buildings.",Expensive but beautiful
"December 15, 2023","Sick but a bit expensive, go at night since it’s better and lit up the price online is much cheaper then going there and buying it! It’s good but if you go in the morning there is no point just go at night!",Worth once if...
"December 14, 2023","Worth once if you don't mind the expensive price and the short viewing. The spacious compartment is commendable. Try your luck, go on sunny day. The panoramic view of London is breathtaking. ",London eye tour

"December 13, 2023",Very easy to use! Quickly moved through the process and enjoyed the view and experience. Thank you. I would recommend this trip advisor offering,We arrived 10 mins late and couldn’t go on so 
"December 12, 2023",Due to unseen circumstances on tube didn’t get there till 10 mins after our time which couldn’t be helped we did try to call no signal people was very rude when we got there I called trip advisor and asked if we could rebook as we couldn’t help it they said no so we lost 150 quid could of rearranged it for us unhelpful money for nothing never booking with them again ,SOMEONE SCREAMED HELP AND MOULDY UNCLEANED ROOM
"December 11, 2023","Our room was disgusting. Used towels in the sink, unwashed sheets with stains and bed not made, the bin was overflowing and hadn’t been emptied, damp walls, windows were broken so it was freezing and heater didn’t work, mouldy glasses and shower was broken so we couldn’t shower for our stay! The staff were rude when we asked for our room to be cleaned and were very unwelcoming. On our first night we heard someone getting beaten up outside our room and screaming ‘HELP’. We had people knocking on our door all hours of the night throughout our stay looking for their room because it was so unorganised. The front door was never locked so anyone could come in and our hotel room door had damage on the lock so we felt very unsafe staying here. It was noisy and the walls are hollow so you can hear everything all night. We would NOT come again and recommend anyone staying to ask them to change your sheets as it is obvious they do not clean between people, we saw people leaving hotel rooms and within 10 minutes another person was staying there. Disgusting and scary experience. ",Couldn’t see much
"December 10, 2023",My wife and I went whilst on our honeymoon. It was raining outside which wasn’t the best (I know that’s no one’s fault)  but what ruined it was the condensation on the inside. By the time we got to the top we couldn’t see. In my eyes it was a waste of £90.As you can see by the photo. No one was that interested because they couldn’t see out.,An attraction on our London attraction itinerary
"September 12, 2021",Booked on line. No long queues and got on the attraction very quickly. The pods were being cleaned and sanitised before anyone was allowed on. The pod was clean and the views for brilliant. The ride lasted around 45 mins and was worth the price. In a brilliant location and easy to get to,Great Views 
"March 7, 2020","You get some great views of London from both sides of the pod you're in. Considering the amount of people that use the Eye it is quite expensive, the best thing to do is log on to 'Days out London' and get buy one get one free, which makes the trip £30 for 2 people, a lot better than £60 for 2. You also get to see the 4D show, it lasts for about 5 minutes and is well worth it. Would recommend but only 2 4 1.",2 attraction ticket
"March 11, 2020","Wheelchairs are catered for and staff in ticket office were very helpful. Making our way through the roped queue system we found ourselves faced with uphill ramp to get to the pods. 2 members of staff saw us as we started up the ramp. There were some stands and rope providing 2 access routes. However neither were wide enough for the wheelchair. As my husband pushed me and the chair up the ramp I had to lean and try to move each bollard so we could get passed. The 2 staff just watched, smiling at us. Neither had any sense of moving to assist us get to the top. Once at the top my husband and bag were checked. I wasn't!! So if anyone had been watching it's clear how to get a device onto a pod. Everyone needs to be checked. Enjoyed the ride but personally was a bit underwhelmed. ","Good, but is it priced too high? "
"August 19, 2020","Myself and my partner visited London on a mini break and decided we would go on the London Eye. It was my second time being on it so I don’t know if that made it less exciting for me or not but to me it does seem over priced for what you actually receive. You are also put into a pod with other people but I think there is an option to have an exclusive pod at a higher price.For us the cost definitely overshadowed the experience and would really only recommend if there is an option to do it at night, I think this would help with the wow factor and help justify the price, on a standard day it was lacking something for us. Staff were very helpful and pleasant, and good covid 19 protocols in place.","Excellent view, but expensive"
"January 3, 2020","Great view and experience in the cabin- there is plenty of time to look around and take pictures.The 4D cinema 4 minute movie is also great and worth doing (quick to do).However... victim of its own success, look at the picture of the standard queue (even if part is the passing foot traffic). I couldn’t face it and we took fast track, where there was also a wait, but its okay (less than 10 min roughly when we were there). And most of all, fast track or not, its very expensive! Around 80 pounds for two for a total of 25 minutes capsule time (fast track).On balance, it’s one of those things to do as part of the London tourist trail that you can’t get elsewhere. It’s down to what you are ready to pay..",Eye got a bargain...
"November 17, 2020",On my visit to Madame Tussauds I was given the opportunity to buy a reduced price ticket for the London Eye. The ticket was only £4 so was an absolute bargain. I visited during October half term. I was early for my pre-booked slot but was able to make my visit earlier. The queue wait was only about 10 minutes. Due to social distancing there were only very small groups in the capsules which meant there were lots of opportunities to take great photographs. I visited due to the bargain ticket but I do feel that there are better places to get views of London now. I particularly like the Sky Garden which is completely free. ,Great view - expensive and a long queue
"October 4, 2020","One of the main attraction in London, and you should definitely view it. However, I recommend booking a slot online in advance, so you are able to skip the queue. It offers a variety of premium options, that may also be of interest. Overall it is a pleasant experience, with an amazing view. Although it states that the ride is 45 minutes is it 20-25 mins in total.",a must do
"July 1, 2020","would highly recommend doing this. isn't too expensive, your on it for a decent amount of time so not too short but not so long it gets boring. can get fab pics, would deffo recommend going just before the sun sets so you get daytime and nighttime pictures. ",All experience
"August 25, 2021",Very good experience all in all. The pre booked ticket allows you to join the line and there were no issues with that. Staff very friendly and helpful. The queue was very long but was constantly moving so it didn’t feel like we were there very long before we were getting into the pod. The pod was rather busy and getting to the best spots to see stuff was a bit challenging at times. The adults in the party had a great time and the kids started out with enjoying it but after 25mins of looking at everything they soon burnt out. I’d advise just bringing a little toy for young kids just in case. All in all a good experience,The most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom
"July 2, 2020","The London Eye on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. It is an observation wheel that offers amazing views of the city from above.  It is also the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom and over 3 million people visit it every year. But this time it was completely empty and the area deserted due to the coronavirus lockdown. I have to say that it is definitely worth visiting. During this unusual time, you have time to stop and enjoy the beauty of what surrounds you. Especially if you are lucky to be there when the sun is shining.",Pub experience- keep your money.
"July 24, 2022","We paid for the VIP pub capsule trip - very expensive, but thought it would be worth it. Wrong. The VIP area to meet was a dingy little corner area, cannot be called a room or lounge, expecting to be given our first of two cocktail drinks, prior to boarding the Eye. Orders for cocktails were taken, but no drinks appeared, as we were suddenly rushed off to board. The guide/attendant rushed off into the crowds waiting beside the Eye, (must have been a few hundred people queuing to board on Standard tickets). We had to somehow follow him pushing passed the crowds of people, who obviously gave us some looks as to who are these people pushing passed us. There is no separate entrance for VIP ticket holders, just squeeze by those waiting patiently to board. With much pushing and smiling to placate people we arrived at the front of the queue to board the designated pub pod.  There were 10 of us in total who managed to keep together to reach the pod.  It was only then that we received our first drink, though it suggests you have that  before boarding. This was in plastic cups not glass!!. Then the 2nd drink quickly followed as the entire trip is only 30 minutes long. When leaving, we could not take our unfinished drinks with us ( who knows why not) but either had to down it in one or leave it behind. All in all a very, very expensive poorly organized  rip off.",Never felt so unsafe!!
"August 13, 2021","My young grandson and I went on the London Eye this week and I have never felt so unsafe since COVID began. Having been 2 years ago and experienced the crowds, I wrongly expected, in the midst of a pandemic, that there would be a substantial reduction of the numbers allowed in each pod. Not so!  Even though our tickets were timed, the queue was long and no social distancing. No reduction in the numbers in each pod and despite a couple of small signs to wear a face covering, I was the only person doing so!I realise I could have refused to travel but as I was with an excited 9 year old and did not see the lack of masks until too late, we went ahead. Going into the shop to collect our photos, it was so crowded that they were asking people to leave if they weren’t picking up their photos.  We got out of there as soon as we could!Obviously money means more to this company than people’s safety and I will boycott anything they are associated with in future!Shame on you!!",Chaotic Organisation!!
"July 30, 2022",Appalling queues despite booking time slot which incidentally only allows you to start queuing so you book for say 3pm and if you are lucky get on around 4pm. Incredibly unhelpful staff who were far more interested in getting peoples photos taken than assisting.We were 2 pensioners with a helper to little girls of 7 and 5 and a 1 year old in a pushchair. The ride of course was spectacular but absolutely not worth the cash or hassle to get on!!,Always amaze’s me
"March 24, 2020","Went for a weekend up in London before it all went into lockdown for the corona virus and the place was empty.We had merlin passes anyway but didn’t have to use to fast track que. walked straight on with out stopping, the team were whipping everything before and after people got into a pod while also keeping numbers low in each pod.Want to go back at night and when it is a clear day, we went with it being cloudy .

"August 9, 2020","Three of us went on a sunny Saturday 28,28 & 4 years old. While me and my wife had been before our girl had seen the “big wheel” and wanted to go happily oblige. It’s good to see her little reactions to going round and seeing the different sites of London & the staff again really good with her given the situation with Covid. Only thing I’d say is for two adults and a child it was £87 and felt it was expensive for what it was BUT if you want to do these things obviously have to pay and so that being said her little face made it worth while.

"February 17, 2020","3rd time on the eye , first for a few years and the best yet. This time we went for the VIP champagne experience with the host and also had a wheelchair user in our party. We couldn't have been better looked after with a host escorting us to the wheel so we didn't have to navigate the long queues with the wheelchair and were able to wait at boarding area for rest of group booked in same time slot as us for the Champagne experience. Staff were very helpful, friendly and patient when boarding and disembarking which they provide a ramp for to make it easier.As for the actual ride, just as amazing as ever, always new buildings to see in the ever changing London Skyline!!

As it's August and we have just come out of lockdown it was very crowded! Hand sanitiser available before and after  the experience. It was good to see the pods being cleaned before we got in. Aircon inside pods. Some pods were fuller than others ours had around 12 people but easy to stay apart and move around. ,Not worth the time or money
"May 16, 2023","My Wife and I did the London eye. We basically did it just because we didn't know if we'd regret not having done it if we didn't .  It's definitely not worth the money . $100 U.S. for 2.  It was just ok , nothing special. We went on a Monday evening about 5:30 PM. We didn't have a very long line at all and what line we had moved quickly. I really would have not been happy  if  we had spent a long time in line and spent $100.

"January 5, 2020","Would highly recommend the Champagne/VIP experience to anyone. The price difference over a standard ticket isn't that much, but you get a better experience overall. We arrived early and headed upstairs to the Eye Lounge. Staff greated us and allowed us to sit down and enjoy the bar despite being early. We had a quick drink and enjoyed the views from the window of the bustling streets. When our time arrived a member of staff gathered everyone together and guided us to the Eye. We cut out all the queues and were straight on in less than 5 minutes. Once moving the champagne trolley was opened and we were all given a glass. We also had a 360 view piece of card with all the sites on so you knew what you were looking at. Pod wasnt crammed with people so we could get nice photos and the staff onboard were knowledgable and gave us some history on London.

"January 3, 2020","Outstanding experience! The entire Champagne experience is about an hour.  Spend the extra money and add the predeparture cocktail to your package it was well worth it.  If your going to London , the London Eye should be on the top of your list of things to do",You should try it !!!
"February 25, 2023","The most famous tourist attraction in London after Big Ben.The London Eye is a location that everyone should visit in UK.It's in the center of London and easy to find. Located next to Westminster's Underground station.The price of visiting it , it's between 27-30euros per person for 30mins.The staff is really helpful and kind.The view is the best part of that attraction.Definitely the best photos should be taken in there.....",definitely worths a ride
"November 24, 2022","My boyfriend (now fiancé) proposed to me at the London Eye last Monday, 14th November 2022. He booked a private pod at 5:30pm. It was amazing and unforgettable! We sincerely want to thank all the London Eye team members who helped us during 5:00-6:00pm on that day.My fiancé and I met in Hong Kong and have been dating for seven years. This was our first time coming to London together and the proposal was truly surprising!  He said that without the help from the London Eye team members, the proposal wouldn't have been that successful.Your members tried their best to help my fiancé to hide the truth for bringing me to the car (until one of them said a warm ""good luck"" to us before entering the car, which made me start suspecting haha)! When we finished our ride, the team members at the ground also congratulated us cheerfully.London eye definitely worths a ride! Thank you so much again.",Not COVID safe
"December 19, 2020","We were hoping to enjoy a trip on the Eye for our daughter’s birthday and having read the website we felt confident that the COVID safety measures in place would mean we were able to do it without worrying. Unfortunately, beyond the temperature check at the entrance, there seemed to be few safety measures actually taking place. Staff members were wearing masks incorrectly, telling people to take their masks off for photos and not encouraging people to put masks on or wear them appropriately. I don’t remember seeing any hand sanitising stations in the queue and although there were markings to encourage social distancing on the floor, no one appeared to use them. We were ushered into a pod with three couples (so 10 people in total), which felt like a large number of individual groups in a relatively small space where we were supposed to stay a safe distance apart. Sadly, while we would’ve loved to have been able to enjoy the trip we were too preoccupied trying to keep ourselves and the people around us safe. Definitely a one and done experience for us! ","Well organised, covid friendly!"
"August 29, 2020","Went to the London Eye this week, two adults and four children, ages 3-11. Arrived well before our prebooked time slot and just sat and watched the Eye going round for a while. We asked if we were allowed on before our time slot as it wasn’t very busy, and they said yes. We went through security (bag search) and then went up to join a very short queue. There were hand sanitizer pumps all around, which were being used by the majority of people. Before we entered the capsule, four people quickly went in and did security checks with long handled mirrors and wiped all the handrails down.Then onto the Eye capsule with two other people, so eight of us in all in one capsule, which we felt comfortable with. Adults and over 12s had to wear masks, which is normal now!I felt really comfortable and secure on the ride, and although it was slightly cloudy on the day we went, the views were amazing, we all thoroughly enjoyed it and the 30 minutes went really quickly. We opted not to have the “official” photograph taken as we took plenty of our own.Great experience!!",Overpriced 
"March 9, 2020",Great views but way overpriced.30 pounds per adult and 24 pounds for kids is way too much.15 pounds per adult and 10 pound per child is more than adequate ,Well worth doing once
"September 23, 2023","Well worth doing when the weather cooperates. We were there on a beautiful sunny  Sunday afternoon and had a great view.  It was very crowded, but they did a pretty good job of organizing the lines.  As others have mentioned, the time on your ticket is the time you are ""allowed"" to get in line.  Because it was so crowded, they were sending different time groups to separate roped off areas to queue. Ultimately that worked well. I was a little jealous of the fast track people, and it may be worth it if you're solo or maybe a couple., but it gets very expensive for a family.  I think they say they put 25 people in each pod, but we had 30.  It looked like the fast track groups had under 20.  Even with 30 people we were able to easily move around the pod and get all of the photos we wanted.We were there on an extremely hot day, and I was concerned that inside the pod would feel like an oven despite the claims of air conditioning.  Happy to say that wasn't the case.  If you stand on either side of the pod you can be in the direct AC flow, but even at the ends it was cool enough.Within my group, we had one person who is afraid of heights and another who suffers from motion sickness. I'm happy to say neither had any problems on the London Eye.  The wheel moves so slowly that motion wasn't a problem (the pods don't move freely), and no problem with the height.",A bird's eye view of london
"May 26, 2020",As long as you don't have a fear of heights then the Eye shouldn't be too daunting for you; once you get through the waiting line you simply jump on the moving cars and soon you rise above the whole city of London. From the top of the huge wheel you can see Big Ben and Westminster palace and other sights like the headquarters of MI6. On a clear sunny day you'll see London for miles and it's a good way to plan out your trips since you can see where everything is.,Amazing view of London!
"May 12, 2020","We loved this ride, it was calming and breathtaking. The kids enjoyed the break from walking and I could get all the photos I wanted of the city. Must go and buy tickets online ahead of time to avoid the lines.",Good attraction spools by poor Covid measures
"July 9, 2021","We choose a trip on the Eye in advance of the recent rising infection rates, however their website suggested good Covid measures and reduced capacity. This translated for is reality to a non socially distanced queue for more than 40 mins, where by we were put into a cabin where by a group in there preferred the selfie taking pleasures rather than masks. There were 12 in the pod which is a reduced from the normal 28 however they only chose to fill less than half of the pods meaning there were at least half of them empty. Over all the Eye is a great experience but the Covid measures in place means there is no internal monitoring  of the cabins, no mask enforcement and you have more people in the pods then there needs to be, a great experience negatively impacted by poor Covid safety measures. ",Eye really liked it!
"March 18, 2020","My wife, teen son, and I found this to be a great attraction.  It was our son's idea, and our first activity of the day.  We had a skip the line ticket.  Still, all riders need to pass through security, and be careful - the Eye does not stop.  You need to step into/out of the pods while they are moving, but they move slowly.  Potential participants with mobility concerns may want to think this through ahead of time.  Once aboard, the pod is spacious, and has seating.  Many London icons are visible from the glass-in enclosure, and the Eye moves slowly enough to take pictures.  At the end, you are offered pictures of your family and souvenir items, which we chose.  We got a book about the Eye, and it included two photos, a magnet, a key chain, and other items.  Souvenir shops await you at the base, and this attraction is convenient to the Hop on Hop of Bus, which stops here.",Memories for a lifetime 
"October 27, 2021","As Merlin pass holders, this was our first time and Wow! What an epic experience.We were happy that we were let on at 10.30am even though our time slot was 11am, and more than happy to be put into the fast track queue, we didn't expect that.The views were clear and it really is a memorable experience.The pods are clean, and are being cleaned for covid every time a pod is emptied.I feel there could be a few more facts around the pod, a book perhaps of what you can see or audio description would be cool.Thankfully we went early as it looked super busy towards lunch time. ",Needs Commentary
"February 26, 2020","No doubt it’s iconic and I guess you kind of have to do it if you’re in London but I reckon that if you have to wait for more than 30 minutes to be able to get on the Eye, it’s not worth it. The view is great but there are better vantage points of the city, such as The Shard. The full trip around lasts just under 30 minutes. I was disappointed that there weren’t any graphics or commentary in the capsule talking about London or the buildings/landmarks you were seeing. I think that would markedly improved the experience. ",Amazing views!
"June 30, 2020","We had an incredible time on the London Eye.   Our pod was not very full so we had plenty of room to move around and take pictures of all the spectacular views.  We went in the evening and seeing the city in lights was from the Eye was stunning.  The ride does one full circle and took about a half hour.  So glad we did this, well worth it!",A MUST SEE
"March 8, 2020","I've been on the london eye many times, purely because I've lived and grown up in London. Everything some of my friends from abroad come over it's always exciting to show them around d london and take them to the london attractions. The views on the london eye are splendid, especially in the evening (I recommend this) as the whole of london is lit up like a crystal ball. It's amazing ",Amazing view
"January 5, 2020","The view was just amazing. There is only one tour but it is more than enough to take all the pictures yo u want. To avoid long long queues, it is better to go at opening (Before 12 preferably). Unforgettable experience !",Great attraction to get full view of the city 
"January 14, 2020","My son loved the ride, and was so enthusiastic to find  all the monuments all around the city. Lines can get real long, it was pretty long even on a very cold weekday early morning. Early as in early even before they open. Its  worth splurging for fast track ",The Eye
"August 27, 2022",The London Eye is a ferris wheel that is along the Thames and gives you a view up and down the river. The lines were long and it cost you $35 per person to do the ride. If you got there early to beat the lines it might be worth it.,Great city views
"June 7, 2022","A great way to get city views.  I was relieved that they limit the number of people in each pod and our fellow riders were good about sharing the good viewing spots.  Not a cheap attraction though so probably a once in a life time experience.  We spent extra for a Fast Track  ticket which did avoid the very long Standard Ticket line, but there is still a queue.  Thankfully it didn't take too long to get to the front of the line.",Seems to Poke Out of the Horizon Everywhere You Go!
"July 15, 2022","I didn’t actually ride on the London Eye, but I admired its presence along the peaceful Thames and loved that its height let me take little glimpses of it seemingly everywhere I traveled within London. Recognize that the Eye is among the most touristy endeavors you could possibly do here—that’s not necessarily a negative thing, but with the common notion in people’s minds that the Eye is quintessential London, there WILL be hoards of people wanting to get on, probably even during off seasons. So expect to dedicate at least an hour standing in line if you really wish to ride it over the summer. Despite not going up on the Eye, seeing it up close and catching it poking out of the city skyline was enough of an experience for me to walk away satisfied. Make sure you really weigh your options and priorities before choosing to actually ride the Eye or not.",Beautiful views of London
"March 1, 2020","My friend was visiting London from Australia and wanted to do ""London things"". She suggested the London Eye and despite being a Londoner for over 6 years of never actually tried it. We bought tickets on the day from the office and went straight onto the eye without having to queue which was great. I was a little apprehensive about the experience as I've recently developed a bit of a fear of heights nothing paralysing but enough to feel a bit panicky. That being said I absolutely loved the experience, we were lucky enough to have timed it at sunset and saw London in its most beautiful light. The information in the pods is very helpful in explaining what all the different buildings are and the pods are big enough to not feel claustrophobic even with a few people in. But I'm glad to say they tend not to overcrowd the pods leaving enough space for everyone to take nice photographs and to feel comfortable. I'd definitely recommend it to visitors and Londoners alike. ",Great views
"February 14, 2020",We pre-booked tickets purchased using Tesco Clubcard vouchers. Otherwise quite expensive at £27 per adult.However the wheel provides an amazing view of London in all directions. It was not too busy and so there was no waiting. There's an encouragement to have photos whilst in the queue and also on the pod. We resisted that!There was also a short 4D film which was quite clever and worth a visit if not too much of a wait.,Single pods 
"September 8, 2020",Having worked all the way through this horrible pandemic we had managed to get some time off together so came to London for a few days. Bought a 3 attraction ticket for 45.00 really good value for money. We arrived at the eye about fifteen minutes early so partner asked if we could queue up early no problem at all. What was nice was due to covid they where only letting people go in in their own groups so we got a pod all to ourselves. Wonderful views over London. As we were waiting to get off there was a group of cleaners ready to board the empty capsules all masked and gloved up to wipe ever where over. Would recommend for a lovely half hour ,A lovely farewell
"February 26, 2020",I’m not a fan of heights but it feels very secure and stable the whole way. A very smooth ride. It is quite expensive (30 pound for an adult or 40 pound for a fast track ticket) but it’s beautiful. A lovely view. I recommend doing it towards the end of your trip. A nice way to farewell London. ,Not that exciting or worth the money.
"January 4, 2020","My kids had been dreaming of going on the London Eye.  It was fine, but way overpriced for a pretty average experience.  There was no guide on the eye that told you what buildings you were seeing, or even a recorded voice to guide you where to look.  It was pretty crowded and I felt like we were jockeying for places at the window to look out of.  Wasn’t a highlight for me at all.",Dual ticket with Madame Tussards online so saving.  Booked times for both online
"July 31, 2022",There were 4 of us and we wanted to do Madame Tussards as well and so purchased online the dual ticket which saves money.  Booked a time slot for London Eye the late afternoon the day we arrived in London and Madame Tussards for the morning soon after it opened to give us time to get to it on the tube.  We didnt queue for long and got in our pod and it was a clear day and dry so that was good.  As 2 of us had been about 12 or so years ago being our first time and it was a rainy overcast day so the views had not been great on that occasion.  We had good views and good pictures and enjoyed it.,Awesome experience 
"February 22, 2020","Never thought I'd get onto this as I hate heights bit my ten year old convinced me to so we did. Absolutely incredible views, went on at half 5 so was perfect so seeing the sunset and the views of the London lights.. Was very spacious and there was no wobbling or anything so it didn't make me nervous about the height. It's worth it. ",Ridiculously Overpriced
"July 7, 2021","Passing the Eye whilst strolling along South Bank we decided to give the Eye a go. The ticket office during the day was closed and the only way to obtain a ticket was using the booking system on-line. Adult prices were a whopping £31 each. The queue was not that long in numbers but it was slow in boarding. The ""kids"" that decided who got on board didn't seem to follow a fixed Covid friendly numbers game so some cabins had 3, some 6 but mine 12 or possibly more. Sometimes a cabin passed with no-one admitted. As for the experience - worth it if you haven't already been up the free Sky Gardens but it really hurts the wallet to pay these supercharged ticket prices. Even if they charged £10 a ticket that might be high for what you get.",Skip
"May 25, 2023","Visited with a fast pass that included any time of day entrance.  While that definitely saved us time, the actual experience was not enjoyable. You are crammed in with other people and when one of them is screaming to get off as employees watch the doors close, you wonder what they are possibly thinking.  So because they ignored the screaming woman we all had to experience the London Eye while she had a full blown panic attack the entire time.",Amazing service considering we were so late!!
"August 2, 2021","We had booked for the London Eye for 1.45pm, after struggling to find parking in London, we didn’t get to the Eye till around 5.15pm. We thought we’d try our luck, expecting to be turned away as we were so late. Spoke to a lady and she said that we were able to still get on! My little girls were so happy and so were we, especially as it’s so expensive. The lady reassured us, and then within 5 minutes came back with some London Eye Binoculars for the little ones. Such lovely customer service, she literally went above and beyond!",Better than expected! 
"February 11, 2020","The missus has been on about visiting the London Eye for years, so we had the opportunity and went. As we arrived, so did about 100 French kids and I nearly binned it, however, a staff member took us both aside and moved us into the fast track queue so we didn’t have to be with screaming 10 year olds which I though was a very nice thing to do. Really appreciated that gesture, so kudos to the staff. Views were better than I expected too! All in all, a decent trip and recommended. ",Amazing time on the London Eye and River Cruise
"August 16, 2022","We had a lovely time on the joint London Eye/River Cruise experiences. Both were always going to be great, but what lifted it even further was the wonderfully informative and humorous commentary by Elliot on our cruise (Saturday 13th August). We thoroughly enjoyed our day.",If you want views a trip to Tate Modern is better
"March 1, 2020",It really isn’t worth it for the money. Better off going to Tate Modern level 10 Viewing Platform for a great view of London skyline and it’s free entry. You could couple this with a river boat ride,Fantastic views
"January 7, 2020","Visited as a family of 2 adults, 9yr and 13 yr old. We got there just after 10 on a Saturday and luckily there was barely a queue. We walked past a few hours later and we couldn’t believe the queues.I think you can have up to 25 in one capsule but we had about 12 and felt that that was just about enough. The views are spectacular! What I liked was that you can sit or walk around the capsule which makes the 30 mins literally flyby.Yes it’s a bit pricy but I would definitely recommend it. I’m hoping I can persuade the family to visit again at night.The only negative was that no one informed us of the 4d experience, I only stumbled across this when looking for a toilet. ",Loved the views
"March 22, 2023","We had a great time on our London Eye Champagne Experience. Arnie, the VIP concierge was super helpful in explaining what we were to expect in the capsule, helping us bypass the long line, and explaining what we were seeing throughout the beautiful city and it’s views. Those views! Cannot imagine a better place to get pictures and a 360 degree vista of London. We were in the capsule with approx 12 people and enjoyed the champagne and conversation. Arnie even gave me hints on how to take portrait photos on my iPhone and on how to edit them. I believe that all those aboard enjoyed themselves and the champagne experience. My only complaint is that we only had enough champagne for one glass per person which seems to be a company policy. Other than that, it was a wonderful experience and we highly recommend this tour.",Total rip off! Not worth it at all!
"April 30, 2023",Really not worth the money. A maximum of £15 might have been ok. Totally underwhelming and feel robbed!! We paid for the fast track to avoid queues but that wasn’t worth it…the standard ticket queue was only twice the length of ours. Would NOT recommend this attraction in London with all the things there are to do in London!,I take all my visitors here!
"September 27, 2020","As a Londoner, I take anyone who visits on the London Eye.  I've been so many times now, but still don't tire of it.  Worth doing anything you can to pre-book and beat the queues however, because it can be a bit of a long wait....",Amazing views
"August 6, 2021","Fantastic views all around London, would highly recommend this experience.  Get there a bit earlier for your time slots and queues can get quite big during busy times.  Well organised and the handrails on each pod are cleaned before the next group get in.",Great Views of London
"August 15, 2021",We pre booked online before visiting and picked an early slot as know it gets busy later in the morning and afternoon.Glad we did have a 11:00 slot as by midday there was quite a queue.Was an amazing experience especially as it was a clear day.We had my elderly parents with us and the staff were very attentive and supportive in getting them on and off the capsules.,Must see attraction 
"September 6, 2021","The whole family loved the London eye. Spectacular views of London. Was a little expensive to pay on the door, but if you book in advance or hunt around the internet for deals you can make substantial savings. We pod £55 for a family of four.",You have to visit without doubt
"October 21, 2022","We have booked standard tickets and we were lucky because the queue was not long, hence we get in quickly. We do not believe that is worthy to spend money for fast track. The speed was acceptable , hence we spent about 30 minutes on the air . The view was incredible even the short showers. My children were really enjoying picturing London from top. The height is long for some of us a bit scary but it’s worthy to do it",Quick London trip
"June 19, 2021",Booked for 11 so to be in the first turn of the wheel - didn't seem to over pack the pods (10 ) so you had enough space to move around . Fabulous views and was helped with it being a clear day so you could see everything. Recommend,Memorable experience 
"October 22, 2022","We had taken Champagne experience on 21st October 2022 evening.Dan was our host for the evening. He was fun, kept everyone engaged and had jolly good sense of humorWe would recommend this to anyone wanting to experience London eye ",View of London
"March 16, 2020","Cool view of London! It goes around slow enough (but not too slow) that you’d be able to take photo from different angles. They do put groups of people in the tube at once, so you’ll be with other people. It’s cool to have such an encompassing view of London ",Fantastic experience!!!
"September 4, 2021","Wedding anniversary gift on trip to London and was the perfect gift to remember everything we’ve been missing about this beautiful city.Great service from start to finish, not as busy as we expected but great weather only added to the beautiful views. Would definitely recommend A special thank you to Stephanie who made our experience that extra bit special ",AMAZING!
"February 2, 2020",Second time on the London eye but this time at night and it didn’t disappoint. The view is incredible and even though the que was long it went down very fast. The booth was fairly full but still managed to see everything and enjoy the experience. You get your bags checked which I think is essential when visiting a tourist attraction especially in London. I was with 2 young children and they thoroughly enjoyed it too. Great experience and one I Highly recommend. To me it is a key thing to experience if you are visiting London. Definitely a highlight of my trip!,The Big Wheel of London
"November 1, 2023","Rising up above the Thames River, at over 440 feet high, is the London Eye, an iconic structure, that is part of the London skyline. The London Eye gave us unparalleled of London. We were lucky that it was a clear day, so we were able to take great pictures of some the most iconic landmarks in London, such as, the Shard building, Westminster, HMS Belfast, St Paul's Cathedral, etc. This is an amazing 30 minute experience, to see of the great cities of the world from that high vantage point. There is a fee, a bit steep but worth the experience. This a great place to see a sunset (if you're able to get tickets), first date, selfies, and to just take it all in. If you're visiting London consider a ride on the London Eye.",Great family experience!
"October 29, 2023","The London Eye was a great experience!   We were very fortunate that the sun came out and we were able to get some amazing views.  We purchased the tickets online through TripAdvisor and walked right in, no problems.  Definitely recommend this, especially at the start of your trip to London so you can get a birds-eye view of London and see what sights you want to take in.","London Eye, standard ticket"
"October 29, 2023",The London Eye was really fun and worthwhile. My family and I did a standard ticket.  In October there was not much of a line. What a fabulous view of London!  The Eye moves slowly so you can drink it all in.  It takes about a half hour.  Take your binoculars!,"London,Eye experience"
"October 29, 2023",I think this was very expensive for the ride you get. I was in with a family who had who had young children. The one was told to run around the pod the other one they kept telling her how she’s afraid of heights.  The view was nice but there’s not a lot of explanation of what you’re seeing.,Great customer service
"October 29, 2023","We were travelling with our autistic son and were having difficulty arranging tickets online (our issues I’m quite sure, not theirs) and were assisted by one of London Eyes agents, who literally could not have been more kind or helpful. He recognized our challenges, walked us through the process (and all the way to the Fast Trac entrance) and engaged wonderfully with our son…..he absolutely went above and beyond and made it a wonderful experience for our family.  Thank you Adewale….very much appreciated!!!",Nice but some tips
"October 29, 2023",You’re not secured of a spot if you buy your tickets online in a certain time slot. And you if you come with a buggy/stroller make sure you bring that to the service counter because those aren’t allowed in the capsule. The flight above London was beautiful though. ,"Could be made much better with adjustments to commentary, location maps and redesign to support photography "
"October 29, 2023","The ride does go around smoothly with very little commentary 😒and there are no maps of London in the eggs to point out the site. The shape of the glass is not good for taking photographs as it distorts the images. views are very weather dependent. Having been up several of the towers around the world, this is a poor experience in comparison to the Eiffel tower, CN tower, Reunion tower, Space needle, ... ",Amazing 
"October 29, 2023",Very nice aera of London . You can see all city around from up. It's so exacting. By the river Temsa. You can come with kids. Walk around. ,Excellent experience 
"October 28, 2023",The attraction is amazing and the staff was very attentive and helpful. Overall is excellent experience. ,Quick queues and stunning views ❤️
"October 28, 2023","Pretty quick to get through the queue which was good, cabin was quite crowded but there was a friendly atmosphere. The views were stunning, as expected, and the voice over was lovely and not too annoying. I think it was an amazing experience for the whole family and would definitely recommend!",Buggy situation 
"March 5, 2020",We’ve been many times before although this is the first time with buggies in the group. Everything ran smoothly and we managed to pick a sunny day.. only issue we had was that buggies are not allowed on the wheel and so we had to wake a sleeping baby to get on and leave buggies behind.,Worth it
"January 19, 2020",We did the Eye towards the end of our week in London and the kids liked being able to pick out everywhere we had been. Buy tickets in advance for a specific time. Waiting in line would not be worth it. We had two that were worried about being scared of heights but in the end it wasn’t an issue. ,An experience
"January 18, 2020",I’m not going to say I loved it but that is personal preference because I’m petrified of heights and sat in the middle the whole time. My husband loved it great views our pod was not overcrowded.I’m glad I done it.,Amazing views.
"October 30, 2020","Always love doing the London Eye, although if we didn't have Merlin passes I'm not sure it's as value for money as it could be. I appreciate why they've done it but I preferred it when the tablets were in the pods to tell you about the buildings etc. Still a great way to pass an hour though!",Very beautiful!
"August 21, 2021","One you get on the London eye it's beautiful, now words, just breath taking. Home, in order to enjoy such beauty I had to be in a queue time of 1 hour, and with small kids that's a bit hard. Nonetheless, it was very nice!",Wonderful experience
"August 7, 2021","Went to buy tickets for the London Eye and the greeter offered me a golden envelope with a card inside that said “Congratulations you’ve received a Wow moment. A private pod for up to six people” Wow indeed! What a wonderful prize. The staff were brilliant and treated us like VIPs as we were led to the head of the queue. The views were amazing, you hardly felt you were moving. Highly recommend the trip.",Good but not great
"August 19, 2021","Second visit to the London Eye, I would only recommend this attraction of you can get discounted tickets. As it just not simply worth full ticket price.Great views and well organised, however Zero social distancing being applied. And the security checks before you get are a joke and looks ridiculous as you watch some teenagers with a mirror walk in talking to each other and then walk out talking to each other without once looking at the mirror and the cleaning crew are only marginally better 😬",Fabulous experience
"October 20, 2020","We were a bit concerned to go as the lockdown restrictions had just been eased and the London Eye hadn’t been re-open for very long. We didn’t need to worry as the staff were very professional, and the whole process went smoothly. There were 7 of us in total in our pod which made the experience really special as we could see so much without being in the way of others. Our kids loved every minute and we’re so sad when the 30 minutes was up. What a fabulous experience!",An interesting London attraction
"February 9, 2023","The building is home to the famous London Eye and offers spectacular views of the River Thames and the surrounding area. The building itself is beautiful, with its iconic architecture and stunning interiors. Inside, you can find many shops, restaurants, and attractions to explore. With its historical and cultural significance, London Eye Riverside Building is a must-see for any traveler.",Very Touristy but You have to do it
"November 5, 2022","This was a great experience.  I hate ferris wheels but this was great.  It moves soooo slow that you can barely tell it is moving.  But, you get amazing views of London from this vantage point.  Also, in the general area, there are several shops and places to eat as well as people watch. ",Great view
"August 23, 2021",So we booked for the last ride of the day and it was still super busy I would say no matter what time you booked get there about 20mins + before you come so your the front of the line .The eye is wheelchair friendly just make sure a staff member knows while in the line so they can stop the ride and put a ramp on . They still let quite a few people on a pod which can be ok if your with polite people who take it in turns to take photos etc … we weren’t and it was madness! That really spoiled it for us as there was a screaming kid who’s mother didn’t care about and was too busy taking selfie’s etc .Now the things that I was shocked about was one they don’t stop the ride when you get on or off it’s still moving so you have to be quick and the other is staff go in and quickly wipe things down ready for the next lot .The view is fantastic and definitely worth going if your in the area,Should get up here
"February 25, 2020","With champagne and skip the line ticket, my husband made sure that I won't forget this day. Our honeymoon has been unforgettable in London. I always wanted to come here and am so grateful for that it finally happened. The view from up here is incredible, you can see so far, about size and beauty of London, this city surprised me.",Better things to do in London
"December 3, 2021","This was an “add on” to our Madame Tussaud’s tickets, it was an ok experience, seeing the whole of London whilst the sun sets was quite beautiful.Me, my wife and our 11 year old sun enjoyed the experience but felt it is a bit underwhelming compared to-other things in London.The queuing system was very confusing, they would allow maybe 16 people into a “pod” then perhaps 4 people in the next one, then the next 2 pods were empty. There doesn’t really seem to be an efficient system in place.Fantastic views and we’re glad we’ve ticked it off the bucket list.",Great Visit 
"January 30, 2020","I was taken on a champagne VIP trip and thoroughly enjoyed it. We started with cocktails in the Eye Lounge, followed by an escorted trip on the Eye with more champagne. This was an expensive option but worth it for a special occasion, and you don’t get stuck in any queues!We were lucky with the weather and enjoyed splendid views over London. ","fantastic views, even on a hazy day."
"August 22, 2022","pre -booked a timeslot for our ride, and only a short time queueing to get on. Quick scan of the metal detector, and wait behind the barrier to be called forward for boarding. Be aware, it doesn't actually stop for getting on or off (except for wheelchair users), so check before you book. but it moves so slowly, it's no worse than stepping on or off an escalator. The views are fantastic, although you may want to get a guidebook to find out exactly what you're viewing. The ride is so smooth, and the pods so stable, you hardly feel any movement or appreciate how high you are (unless you look directly down).",The Eye in London 
"February 17, 2020",The London Eye is visible as Dublin fights turn to approach the runway for Heathrow landing. On the side of the Thames it is a massive structure holding the pods in its circle. I hate heights so I have never gone around on it but my daughter tells me it amazing and her photos from The Eye were fabulous.This time when I was there you could have got straight on without a booking but advance booking is recommended.,Amazing experience
"January 1, 2020","We rode the eye twice. Once at sunset and again in the dark. It is definitely worth doing in both the light and the dark, as they are two totally different experiences. Be warned, the queues are horrendous. Book a time slot in advance online, or at the ticket office on arrival, the be prepared to wait. You don’t board at your given time slot, this is only the time you are able to join the queue. Go mid week term time, or pay for the fast track to limit waiting time. Or, if your planning to visit all the attractions, get a Merlin pass instead!",love the view and it stunning just to stand by!!!
"January 10, 2020","My friend and I, spend a little extra to skip the line so we bought Champagne Package. The experience was great, we were ask to waiting in the lounge upstairs and when it's your time, the guide tour will ask to see ticket and walk you to the giant wheel of London eye on fast track lane. The view was stunning and really smooth ride. Totally worth it. ",Shocking
"February 22, 2023","Shocking experience- toilets closed at 17.45 and yet experience shuts at 1800. Despite begging for access for a two year old child that was about to soil herself I was denied , with the quote “it’s policy”. I only hope that one day in the future your colleague finds themselves in the exact position and is also met with a total lack of human understanding or empathy- genuinely shocking.",Interesting 30min but glad I didn’t pay full price
"October 11, 2022",Originally the highest in the world this one now seems small compared to the mega one in Dubai. It’s an interesting way to see London from above. We used our Merlin passes as I don’t think it’s worth 30+ pounds. I would like some way to have more commentary. Perhaps headphones for those interested?,Amazing experience
"December 10, 2022","My fiancé and I bought the VIP experience and the best part was our guide Arnie. He had our whole group in smiles and made the whole experience just wonderful. I would highly recommend doing the VIP and if you’re able, requesting Arnie as your guide",Great view of the city of London 
"January 14, 2020","I suggest getting the skip the line ticket, because it’s usually packed whichever time you decide to visit. Whole experience takes about half an hour. You get a really great view of the city when your at top. Is it a must do activity? Probably not unless you have excess time to kill. ",Last minute cancellation for dubious reasons
"December 20, 2022","We booked a London Eye Champaign experience we’ll in advance of our trip from the US to London. We were very disappointed that the booking was cancelled the day before citing some sort of technical difficulty.  We were automatically offered a full refund, but we’re not offered any sort of alternative booking.  Worse yet, we could clearly see the Eye was in full operation with passengers while out and about that day.  We just wish we could have been on it.  We’re left to speculate that the reason provided for the cancellation was a poor excuse for overbooking the ride.","Beautiful, but £25?"
"May 30, 2021",Had booked for 1 o'clock had to que 20 min anyway. We were let in with another 7 people.All together. Tickets bought in bundle with Dungeons and Sea life. Total cost £45 per person. Trip was about 30min long. No toilets near. ,Disappointing 
"August 15, 2020","Due to COVID they had removed the four panoramic boards that allow you to identify the various London landmarks. As a result, we really had no idea what to look out for, and therefore we got a lot less out of the visit than we should have. It surely cannot be that difficult to put the boards back and give them a quick wipe with disinfectant between each group? I certainly wouldn’t go back until they replace these boards.",Valentines Day Visit
"February 14, 2020","Went to the Eye as part of Valentine’s Day, it was good. The queue was managed quickly and I was soon on without delays. It is an incredible view and I would recommend it. I got tickets as part of a package where I get to do the Eye, Dungeons, Sherk and Sea Life which i would recommend as it is a lot cheaper and they are all next to each other in a line so get to do them all in a day. ","Amazing nighttime views of London, no crowds"
"November 1, 2023","Wanted to end my London trip on a ""high note"" (get it, since you go up pretty high 😜) and managed to get one of the last times available on the London Eye before it closed.Since this is the first time I'm doing this, I cannot compare it to a daytime experience but this was lovely. No crowds, I was able to get a ticket and get right on. There were only about 12 people in our cabin so all of us got some quality photo time. London is still beautiful at night so I didn't feel like I missed out on anything.Tickets were £45 which is the regular price, the fast pass was £60 but I didn't buy that. The purchasing system was designed to upsell you so that was a bit annoying, just clicking through so many options. I had to help the guy next to me since it was so confusing.But now that I know what the nighttime view is like, I'll likely go back during the day next time.","a bit boring, but got what I paid for"
"February 10, 2020","you can have some lovely views of the river and the novelty is all very exciting at first, but we were up there for such a long time. It's obviously not a fair ground ride. I wouldn't call it fun, but I will give it 5 green dots anyway, because no one told me it would be fun and I think for someone who properly considered how much time it would take to come back down again and still wanted to do it, this would be ideal.",BIGGER than any in the U.S.
"February 28, 2020","Wow!  You could have a party in one of those pods.  So much better and bigger then the similar ones in the U.S. Yes, it's a bit pricey, but worth it at least one time.  You might not can see too far on a cloudy day, but still very much enjoyable.",30 Minute Ride
"February 20, 2020",This is a great way to see the London skyline and the ride last about 30 minutes. You can take the tube to Waterloo and walk over in 5 minutes. Only downside is that you may have to wait a bit even with advance tickets but the line moves quickly. ,✨JORDAN✨
"October 23, 2023","We had a great time during the cruise. And the staff was really kind to us. In particular our tour guide, Jordan, made the trip more enjoyable and funny. So please Jordan, if you’re reading this, you are fantastic and don’t listen to people who say otherwise. Thank you! ✨",Great fun on the river
"October 23, 2023","We booked the river cruise in the spur of the moment and it didn’t disappoint. Jordan, our tour guide was knowledgeable and funny. We thoroughly enjoyed the cruise.",The Eye 
"October 23, 2023",This was one of the best experiences while visiting! VIP package is the way to go ! Thank you Arnie for being so nice and hospitality. Highly recommend ,Didn't have a great experience.  Would not recommend.  
"October 23, 2023","We purchased the champagne experience ticket for the London Eye.  It did not give any instructions on the ticket so we went to the fast track line & asked the employee if we were in the right place.  He said yes, & we proceeded through the line.  There was no one at the front of the line to ask about the champagne so we were hustled on wondering where we went wrong.  The views were beautiful (we chose sunset) however not worth standing in a confined space with strangers who kept pushing their way to the edges for photo ops.  When we exited, we asked another employee about the champagne experience & she said we were out of luck as we did not go to the right place at the start.We did the river cruise as well & that was a good experience (great commentary) however the seats were loose & didn't feel safe.  ",Pleasant but don’t listen to the commentary 
"October 23, 2023",We really enjoyed it. Organised and friendly staff. The boat trip itself was lovely. We sat up on the top. However the huge downside was the script given to the person on the microphone. Who on earth wrote that?  London is a beautiful and historic city but the script was peppered with denigrating references to London and it’s history. At the end it was also suggested that the people on the bridges weren’t waving at us but they were Londoners giving a rude finger gesture. We were appalled. Visitors to London shouldn’t have to listen to this. Please please please change it to something more positive. ,Loved it. 
"October 23, 2023",Loved it. Very organised with really friendly staff. We were a bit early but the lovely person in the ticket office changed it for us. ,"Unexpected, absolutely brilliant!"
"October 22, 2023","It’s our daughters birthday so we had a weekend trip to London for her. Decided to do the river cruise as an upsell to the eye tickets, was pretty cheap and we got fast track so thought why not. Didn’t really have much in the way of expectations. It was absolutely blooming brilliant! The sun was shining, not a cloud in the sky, warm (I’m sure these factors all helped). Still, the sights were beautiful, was comfortable on the boat, good pace. The highlight? The tour guide Jack (22/10/23). He was amazing! I didn’t feel like he was reeling off a script. He was funny, very knowledgeable, very happy. The whole thing was just a complete unexpected bonus for a fantastic weekend. Thank you so much - you’ve helped us make incredible family memories. PS - can you make a way of cashless tipping?!?! He was wicked, would have tipped but no cash…",Nice trip
"October 19, 2023",Brought the family. was very busy but expected as it was a weekend. Just one to tick off the bucket lists for the little ones. Staff where pleasant and everything was as expected,Great
"October 19, 2023",I know people disagree on whether the London Eye is worth it or not. We visited with teenagers and they would very much have the experience - and they were thrilled and thereby I’m happy. Wouldn’t go there next time visiting London as it’s kind of a ‘do it once’-thing. But it was a great visit. Visited at 8PM and there were no people. Great,A great family tourist attraction
"October 19, 2023",The cruise and London Eye were both really enjoyable. The cruise was very informative and fortunately the weather was amazing! The eye was sightseeing at its best!,Lastminute.con
"July 10, 2021",I have never been on the London Eye but I would like to but unfortunately today in the newspaper I noticed it is sponsored by one of the worst and dishonest travel company I have ever had the displeasure to have had dealings with. Please read about them especially on trustpilot and other travel sites. At one point they were goingvto be taken to Court by the government. How they have the nerve to sponsor anyone when they owe people millions in cancelled flights. They are a dusgracecto the travel industry.  Hence the London Eye will have to wait for me until they disappear as sponsors. Sorry but rant over. Nothing personal re tge London Eye itself.,Weekend Tourists
"February 26, 2020","First stop after flight into London city. Easy to self book, quick thru security and a great ride in the view pods. A good experience and clean environment. Would visit again but take the deal on 2 or more attractions, £40 for this isn't cheap. ",Good experience but pod seemed like too many people
"August 15, 2023","The queue was extremely long, but as my sons have a nimbus card we were allowed to use the accessibility line which really helped. The staff members we met were all friendly, helpful and polite. I do think they put too many people into a pod, (but can understand why) as wasn't able to move freely round as everyone was crowded in the same area and my children couldn't always see out.  However it was a good experience and they enjoyed going so high up.",Do At Least Once
"September 18, 2022","On a clear day, this is a really fun way to see London from ""up top."" Given the cost, don't bother when it's terrifically cloudy. Also try to book online even at the last minute. We booked 15 minutes before going in and skipped the ""fast track"" charge. Do buy the guide that shows you what you're looking at, otherwise, you aren't getting the full experience.","Good experience, pretty pricey and overcrowded"
"February 25, 2023","We visited around 4.30pm. The views from the pod are amazing, it takes around 30 minutes and personally found it a little underwhelming. There were around 22/23 people in our pod, which made it difficult to get images. People kind of settled in a spot and didn't move. It was a good experience, unlikely to do it again.  ",Really lovely visit
"October 29, 2020","Our 6 year old daughter had been asking to go for sometime and she was not disappointed. We booked a 5pm boarding and arrived just after, we walked straight through the checks and boarded quite quickly. Everything was very Covid friendly! The skyline was all lit up and we had a clear day which meant you could see a lot. Toilet facilities etc inside the booking hall were very clean and more than enough available. Staff were friendly and chatty with our daughter. ",Big wheel
"January 15, 2020","Second time we’ve been out, we have Merlin premium so we can fast track which is good. We ended up in a pod with a family who liked to take photos, my god, they were so loud and Instagrammable it just ruined the whole experience. Great views over London, was very annoyed at the end when it tells you to stand in the photo zone my daughter did and this group of plastic Kardashians clapped their hands at her and told her to move, I was in a gap behind and made sure I had the most awful face 😂 hope I ruined your picture because I couldn’t be cropped out. It’s a good thing to do in London just hope your get nice people in your pod. ",Always a good experience 
"August 30, 2020",Been on here a few times over the years but has been a long time and our youngest had never been on. The queue was short as I imagine it’s hit by coronavirus. Very impressed with the speedy cleaning between use and the fact that the pods were not rammed as they can be. If you haven’t been on this is a fab attraction to see right across London. I’d definitely recommend you go on. Even if you hate heights like me! ,Ok
"March 13, 2023","Treated my 6 year old to a weekend in London for her birthday. She couldn't wait to get on the London eye. Ended up being a tad disappointed because the capsule we were in was full of adults who hogged the one end (the main view over London) I get that everyone wants to see the view but there's plenty of time for the wheel to spin around for everyone to get a good view and move around. Unfortunately we were unlucky that day and those who were on with us wouldn't let the children onboard get to the main part... Even despite asking politely. So we ended up spending most of our time watching some 20 year old and her boyfriend create their romantic tiktoc or Instagram content.Anyway Would i still recommend it if visiting London... yes absolutely. Hope when we're back in December with the rest of the family, that we can get a better look.",Make sure you book 
"January 7, 2020","Expensive, long queues but one of the must-do things when visiting London. Great views in the sunshine or at sunset but pretty grim if it's a miserable rainy day. Go to Alexandra Palace instead.. Great views across London, free and you can go ice skating there too. ",Great Experience
"January 20, 2022","I would highly recommend going on the London Eye, absolutely fantastic views of London. What a great experience, we booked the fast track tickets so we didn't have much of a wait time. Would definitely recommend.",Never fails.
"February 19, 2023","This is a London classic. I might have visited the London Eye multiple times over the last 10 years, and can never get bored of it.Try it at evening to see the London lights. It's a breathtaking experience.",Even Better than We Thought!
"July 4, 2022","London Eye was our first day ""outting"" - we were hoping to keep the kids up to stave off jet lag and had low expectations.  Boy were we wrong!  Great views, a very slow relaxing ride (even for those with motion sickness like our little guy, you would likely be fine - it goes that gently) and a great sense of place for all of London.  Truly a showcase of London at its finest.  Loved it - great for all ages.  ",Great experience for kids and first visit to London
"December 3, 2022",This was my third time on the eye. The first time taking my daughters. We bought the advanced entry tickets which was so worth it because our day was jam packed with other activities. I love seeing the whole city.,So so ...
"January 27, 2020","Been here a few times and it's very much depending on weather what experience you have there . On a clear day you get good views ,but not many clear days I London.  Huge numbers of people everyday ,make sure you book ticket in advance   . Nothing special but more a money machine .",if you have time to spare
"April 11, 2023","a nice view of the city with a good amount of time on the ride. iconic, and generic. for all the hype, its.....a ferris wheel. and a very pricey one at that, with long lines. not to mention, there are some strangers you dont want to be locked in a box with for half an hour",It's not worth it!
"December 31, 2022",The crowd ruins the experience. They left every other cubicle empty and they squeezed us in with 25 other people. It was literally ruined the experience as not everyone had space near the window. Way too expensive for a medium experience.,London’s best 
"November 2, 2020",Of course if you’re in London you have to visit the London eye. The views of the London eye is even better when you go on it. A clear day you will see some breathtaking views across London city. Highly recommended. ,GREAT
"August 21, 2022","My husband got the London Eye for the 'Champagne Experience', for my birthday. From the moment we arrived, we just saw smiles and kindness from the staff. Dan welcomed us warmly, we went up to the lounge to have a drink, one of the staff members was a gentle girl from Bolivia, excellent service!  Our London Eye guide, Dan was very funny, kind, and cheered the group during the 30 min ride, a fantastic view, and experience with a champagne glass.  5 STARS FOR DAN!Highly recommended (August 13th)",Pre booked trip
"February 23, 2020",Booked this trip prior to visiting london for my partner who wanted to go on it .I am petrified of heights and wasnt looking forward to the experience in the least .Had been to London on previous trip to go on it but couldn't when got there due to enormous size.This time as I had pre booked fast track tickets knew I was more likely to get on the ride.Well what can I say all my fears were un warranted it was amazing cant Express how much I enjoyed it.no movement in large 25 capacity pods and goes so slow dont realise you are climbing. The views are amazing. This attraction is a must I cant believe how much I enjoyed it .,Great experience
"August 24, 2020","This was my second or third time doing the London eye. It’s great to see it open again. It wasn’t busy at all when we went and we had pre booked our experience online which was very handy.They are faking social distancing very seriously and are limiting the amount of people in the pod at any one time, you must wear a face mask and after every visitor they wipe and spray down the pod. ","Lovely experience, something u can not miss in London"
"August 30, 2020","It was absolutelly amazing. Such a lovely experience which u can not skip if u are visiting or living in London. We had tickets for more attractions, we bought all of those when entering the aquarium. It is very helpfull if u got tickets pre-paid, as that will skip u all the queues for each attraction. I will go for it any time again. Just love it.",First time
"March 19, 2022","We pre-booked our timeslot but arrived 20 mins early. As it was quiet, and not much of a queue, they let us on straight away. As it was a lovely sunny morning the views were excellent and the wheel moved at a pace that you could really take your time with the photo opportunities. ",Champagne Experience
"September 1, 2022","I have a cousin visiting from abroad and this was the 1st place he wanted to go. We did the Champagne ride. The host was fab( forgotten his name but he is from Brazil) very knowledgeable pointing out all the places of interest while we were up there and kept us all entertained. He found out a bit about everyone and made us feel special, which added to the overall experience.  I would highly recommend the ride on the Eye",Placed in a crowded pod while others were practically empty
"October 18, 2022",This was my second time on the Eye.  Don't pay for the extra stuff--just purchase a regular ticket and plan to queue.  We were disappointed that we were put into a pod with about 7 rambunctious kids whose parents did not supervise them while the other pods were practically empty.  Cool views the weather was exceptional.  ,Now is the time to fly
"September 6, 2020",This was a great time to fly the eye  for the wrong reasons   Covid 19 is keeping tourists away such a pity .as the safety measures put in place are brilliant with a temperature check and swift cleaning of the pods between  customers making you feel really safe.The upside to this  no long queues and less people per pod  meaning great views and photo opportunities,Pub Car!!!
"May 10, 2022","We took our first trip on the Eye in the Pub Car, which for one of us was highly necessary, as a drink helps with the fear of heights!Shout out to Dan and Harry, our guides and bartenders, who were absolutely lovely with their stories about the landmarks we could see, and for providing a truly fun atmosphere. In addition, the reduced number of occupants in the Pub Car made for a likely more enjoyable experience than the usual. Thanks Dan and Harry!",Even better than anticipated
"March 21, 2020","London Eye obviously was a much see. Was a bit higher than i thought and was concern about my fear of height. Overall experience is extremely stable, except slight jerks when it stops and go sometimes. but you won't feel it much. the experience is amazing and so is the view!!! Great 30 minutes experience not just the view to be in the highest ferris wheel is quite amazing!!",Magical views of London
"August 21, 2022","We booked a Champagne flight as part of a wedding anniversary trip to London. Pushed the boat out to celebrate with a Champagne tour. Reception really slick, lively room with great view of the Eye and across the river. Fast track escorted access limited to 16 people. Wow experience and view mind blowing - not to be missed. Would have been a 5* if not for the the tour guide who seemed intent on being the main attraction",Must visit 
"January 6, 2020",Third visit Bussiness as usual entertaining and busy . 3D experience was good. It’s obviously a must see attraction if in london one enjoys it every time though it is nothing out of the world.,😤
"February 11, 2020","Great attraction for a family with kids.We had to give us the tickets we pre-booked for the Big Bass tour attraction and didn't give, that's why we lost an attraction.You are being photographed without your knowledge and at the exit trying to sell you expensive products.",One of the best views
"March 13, 2023","The whole experience takes about 30 minutes. I viewed the city from the Shard, Skyview Garden, and the London Eye.  The due to the location, the London eye provided the best views of London's attractions.",London Eye VIP
"December 17, 2023",We booked a VIP experience and it was really fabulous.We were booked straight in and shown to the Eye Lounge for half an hour before the ride. Charlie our guide was really friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We were able to purchase a drink prior to the ride in the lounge and were served by a lovely young man behind the bar.All staff had impeccable manners.We were taken to the front of the queue to board and had a wonderful half an hour on the Eye. The champagne was poured and Charlie gave us lots of facts about the skyline of London.We shared the cabin with ten others but h th eye wa comment of room and everyone gave each other the option to look through the windows of the different views. Charlie also took photos as requested.Would definitely rate this experience and do it again.,Good lockdown visit
"November 21, 2021",Went over lockdown - had a really good time with a pod to our self. If there was 20 people in one I think it wouldn't be a great experience. Takes you to a good height and is great to see around the area from that perspective.,Couldn’t see much
"December 10, 2023",My wife and I went whilst on our honeymoon. It was raining outside which wasn’t the best (I know that’s no one’s fault)  but what ruined it was the condensation on the inside. By the time we got to the top we couldn’t see. In my eyes it was a waste of £90.As you can see by the photo. No one was that interested because they couldn’t see out.,Ivan Van Der Westhuzien - employee of the year
"April 8, 2023",Birthday treat to the London Eye today. Had a standard ticket and whilst waiting in the queue the fabulous Ivan Van Der Westhuzien greeted us took us to the fast track queue! He was vibrant and we really enjoyed chatting with him.,First post Covid Trip
"August 10, 2020","We've been on the Eye 4 times and every time it has been great, This was our first visit after social distancing. The staff were superb in everything they did and our party of 6 were provided with a pod on our own. Each pod is thoroughly cleaned between rotations. Great experience. Thanks",My teenager liked it
"February 20, 2020",My teenage daughter really enjoyed the ride and the views even though she is not very comfortable with the heights.Very well organized business. I would suggest to purchase tickets online so you don’t need to stay in a queue to buy them at the London eye.,Well worth a visit on a clear day
"January 1, 2020","Really loved this, the views were great, the queue wasn’t too long, although it is a bit of a strange spilt queue system. The inclusive 4D was good fun too, kids would love it. I would suggest trying to plan your visit for a clear day though or it’ll be a waste of money.",Extra time
"October 18, 2021","A must do for first time visitors to London.  The pods are airy and bright,  with plenty of space.  On our trip we were fortunate enough to have extra time at the top as there was a slight technical hitch.  This was calmly and promptly dealt with.   A great memory. ",Ideal to See All of London
"February 15, 2020","A must see while in London. Highly recommend buying tickets in advance. Seamless to get into (we entered half an hour before our selected time slot). Anticipate about 30 minutes of slow movement as the eye (Ferris wheel) turns. Was pleasantly surprised by how smooth it felt-did not feel the movement and took incredible pictures and saw the sights. Very close to Big Ben, Westminster Abbey and the SeaLife Aquarium.",OK.
"July 29, 2022","We had so looked forward to this visit but it was so disappointing. The woman on security , checking the bags, was abrupt and officious to the point of rudeness, and this spoiled things at the start!Then, on the ‘flight’, the Eye came to a halt when our pod was two thirds of the way to the top. There was a twenty minute delay while engineers fixed the problem.This will be our last visit to the Eye !!!!",Up up and away!!
"February 16, 2020","A must do in London! The queue moved super quickly, wouldn’t bother with the fast pass. Went around 12pm and had ticket booked for 12:30pm, they didn’t say anything so it was fine! Doesn’t feel like you’re up there that long but it’s a good half hour! The pics at the end were funny and cute if you want a keepsake. Staff were lovely, which is always great to see when dealing with largely tourists. So well done to them!!",2nd visit 
"August 8, 2020","Visited here on a recent stay in London. I unfortunately  had to use a crutch to support myself, but this was not a barrier to enjoying the experience.  Indeed, I booked standard tickets  online, but I  assume because  of needing to use a crutch, we were fast tracked at no additional cost. The covid precautions were very good and the London eye itself was very good.",Best view in London
"March 7, 2020","We went as a school group so we were able to fit 25 of us into one pod. Best views in London by far, you can see Big Ben (currently under construction), googles office, Buckingham palace, and so much more. Book your tickets a head of time for a time slot. It was not very busy in February when we visited. ",Fast Track is the One
"February 18, 2023","Been on here many times before but never with Fast Track. It was so good. Tickets and Fast Track inclusive in our Merlin passes and it’s so easy. Fast Track was… Fast! We were on in less than five minutes. Obviously some people can’t afford to pay the walk up prices for Fast Track, but if you can then definitely do it. Man I said Fast Track a lot!",But is it worth it?
"August 2, 2022","I'm not sure. Our tickets said 15:15, and we go there around 15:00. It turns out that the time on the ticket is not the time to get on the Eye, it is the time to be allowed to stand on line. Got on at 16:05. The view, indeed, is spectacular. But two days later took the boat (public transport) to Greenwich, and the view from the observatory is no less impressive. An experience? Perhaps. A Must? No",Brilliant VIP experience!
"May 2, 2023","I booked the VIP champagne experience for myself and my husband and once the coronation was announced we were upgraded to the coronation capsule! We got to sit on the throne and wear the crown in the capsule while taking in breathtaking panoramic views of London. The standout was our host Arnie - he was amazing! A great sense of humour, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and a brilliant photographer. He made sure everyone was included and had brilliant memories to take away with them. I absolutely recommend this experience to anyone visiting London.",Wonderful Attraction!
"March 3, 2020","Everything went smoothly. We arrived about 45 minutes earlier and were told to join the queue 30 minutes prior to our ticket time. We did so and were directed to our capsule, which had a bunch of lovely tourists whom took turns to take one another's photographs. We loved every minute. Just a bit disappointed that the Big Ben was scaffolded. The 4D cinema afterwards was an added bonus, the kids had a blast with the special effects. I highly recommend.",Amazing Service
"September 26, 2020",Had booked as a package deal but couldn’t book online for an extra experience at the time so we’re advised to go to customer service on the day to upgrade.Annoyingly that was not the case on arrival as fully booked ( gutted ) but the manager did arrange for a private pod at no extra cost!!! So kind and much appreciated and all the staff from start to finish were so so friendly especially  as we had a nervous passenger lol.The views were amazing and even though really high winds the pod felt safe. Only issue was the half and hour seemed like 5 minutes!!!!!!Can’t wait to return for a trip at a different time of day.Highly recommend and many thanks to all the staff - great experience- we loved it!!!!,Pub Pod - Great host and experience
"September 19, 2021","We did the pub pod experience today. Right from the start the service was brilliant ! We were greeted by Arnie and another lovely chap at the reception and given our gift bag. We waited about 10 minutes for the pod to come round and throughout we were updated. Once in the pod Arnie was brilliant, his knowledge of London and the skyline we could see was amazing  ! He was a great host and really made the experience ! Great experience and would 100% recommend if visiting London.",Great overview of `London in an attraction
"February 27, 2022",Depending on the time stamp there wille be a que. but well worth it. A good overview of London from the Thames. Enough time to t are pictures of different angles of London form different heights and yourself and accompany.,Amazing
"February 19, 2020",Visited Sunday evening of the 16th. No we walked straight on and had an amazing ride. Kids loved it and the views accross the city were amazing.  Booked this trip as part of the five attraction  package. Great  value,Great views!
"February 5, 2022",A great way to see the London skyline. You can see almost every major landmark. Bought this ticket in a deal with other London attractions to get good value for money. Bags are searched by security before boarding which is reassuring also.,The view is breathtaking. Also the que-it is worth to get priority!
"July 20, 2022","It is a logistic nightmare to get on board, especially if you have a simple ticket. So we quickly upgraded to priority, that saves at least 1 hour. It matters if you are with small children...The cabins are comfortable size, provide good view. The sight is breathtaking.","Fabulous, Worth a visit - fun & nice views"
"February 13, 2022","Great experience, wonderful view, takes 30  minutes to spin around once. Great photo oportunities. Go early in the day. Suitable for groups big or small",The London circle
"July 15, 2022","From the outside this iconic landmark displays a perfect circle. A full 365 degrees (according to my wife Sienna) However upon experience I realised that I am scared of heights which made my stomach hurt. Also I’m also visually impaired so I cannot guarantee that it is a perfect circle. My question to londerners, why is it called an eye? It is a pressing question which my life depends on. Kind regards, Bernardo",Not worth it
"September 26, 2022","It was, to be blunt, rather underwhelming.  I suppose I built it up but for the cost it was definitely not worth it and I've already shared with my family and advised them not to go. Not that my 2 you gest would have gone anyway as they really don't like heights.",Definitely do the champagne experience 
"February 24, 2020","Great way to see London sites from up high, but the line ups tend to be quite long. The champagne experience gets you like bypass, and a guided vip tour inside the cabin where you all get to enjoy a glass of champagne. Great experience ",Nice ride
"October 28, 2022",Nice little ride for the money. You can see lots! Be nice to have some commentary telling you where buildings were or what to look out for etc. but it’s fine. Queue wasn’t too bad either. Booked slots. Would he lush at sunset!,Arnie for the VIP experience win
"March 18, 2023","We booked the VIP experience earlier this week. Unfortunately, it was the same day as an underground strike. Because of all the traffic , we were 7 minutes late and missed our 3:30 time. When we arrived Arnie was generous enough to rebook us on the next experience at 4:30. He went with us and made everyone feel comfortable and welcomed!it was a very nice experience. We were up there for 30 minutes and saw all the major sights around while enjoying champagne. Thanks Arnie!","Excellent experience , a must do in London"
"October 2, 2023","Easy access, very nice experience, beautiful views.. we had a very good time, reached before time with pre booked tickets. Could access from the faster line and were allowed to enter before time which saved us a lot of time. The pace was good and the sights were spectacular. Number of people per pod was also optimum. ",London eye
"February 19, 2023",Went on this today and it was well worth the money. We went late in the day and was only in the que for about 10 minutes total. The views of London in the earl evening was awesome.  Plenty of room to move around the pod to take photos. Staff was very helpful and nice.  The pods were very clean and inspected after each group departed ,Expense but good view
"October 3, 2023",Expensive but good view of the city.  It moves so slowly you can’t tell you are moving.  We did it on the first day of our trip and it gave a nice view of the city.  I think slightly overpriced for a 25-30 min ride.,Part of the landscape.
"August 10, 2020","Just has to be done if you are sight seeing in London. Que is usually massive. Would always book on line and pay for fast track to make things easier, or go later in the evenings.Beautiful views of the city.",Wheely high!
"March 4, 2020","Only gave this 5 because my husband was so pleased to be here! The view was stunning to be fair 😀. The staff were very helpful to me, as I walk with two crutches. They made getting on and off easy for me.  They also clean all surfaces between parties and check under the seats for ?bombs. ",18th birthday present
"November 8, 2022","18th birthday experience for my son who has autism, I got the Access card before travelling to London which was very useful and meant we could skip the queues.  Bought the river cruise and eye tickets together and with a carer ticket it brought the price down a bit.We all enjoyed the experience and my son can now stop nagging me to take him! We also did the cable car at Greenwhich, cheap and also a fun experience :)",Ok
"January 11, 2020","Don’t expect earth-shattering views, but was good for our 1st visit to London. And online ticketing was so easy too. The car gets quite full so expect to have to “fight” your way to a good viewing spot. For my son it was a great time to spend with his UK mates, so worth the spend.",OK if you can get 2 for 1 deal
"March 4, 2020",Slightly underwhelmed by this. Seemed to be a wee bit shorter of an experience than I thought it would be. Views are good - just make sure it ain't too crowed.  Wouldn't go if you have to pay full fare.,No need to panic - it’s smooth as silk
"January 30, 2020","No need to panic - it’s smooth as silk.  Fabulous views over the north and south of the river, panoramic photo opportunities and memories you will never forget.  Excellent time of the year to go as there are no queues.",Beautiful at day n lit at night 
"February 14, 2020","London eye is beautiful at day, check timings before you go there if you want to get on it.view is beautiful at night too with lights on the London eye n the Parliament House. You can view it from the Shard building as well.",Champagne Was The Go
"March 7, 2020",First hour in London and I did the Eye with some friends. We chose the Champagne Experience and got away from the crowds. Fast track the ticket area. A private VIP champagne lounge. And then fast tracked the boarding. Small number group allowed plenty of room to view the London skyline. Great start to the London adventure. ,Great view
"April 21, 2020","Really great view, especially in December. Great family event. Recommended for anyone who likes heights or thrills. Near Southbank Market, and Southbank Wagamama. Also have a crazily high ride and buskers",Bird's Eye View
"January 15, 2020",Taking in the London Eye is an excellent way to see the city. Be mindful it is not for those who can't take heights. The engineering is impressive and the ability to see everything in a 360 degree manner is superb. It travels slow enough around to take London. Well worth the wait in line!,Great time on the eye.
"October 6, 2020","We were given a pod to ourselves as it was so quiet, no queuing just went straight on, luckily we had great weather so amazing views across London, great for taking photos. If you want a good time to go now would be the best time. Book before you go for the best price. ",Beautiful views of London
"February 16, 2020","Beautiful 30 minute round trip of the city views. However, expensive. Advised to use any buy 1 get 1 free tickets, or alternatively book Free Sky Garden tickets, its actually more impressive. ",Nice day to visit!
"January 5, 2020","Purchased tickets online beforehand so had a very short wait. Nice clear day so the view was brilliant. Capsule not too crowded. Nice photograph at the end in presentation book, great keepsake. Thankyou!",London Eye Pub Pod
"June 30, 2021","I treated my husband and I to the London Eye Pub Pod experience which was fantastic and well worth the money. Our host and Barman AJ was brilliant and the goody bag was a lovely gift. The views were great, I would definitely recommend this experience.","Pub expert... Don't think, just do it!"
"September 3, 2021","The pub experience! Can't recommend enough! Right from arrival, your sat in a waiting room which feels professional and slick! Our host, AJ, who was fantastic. Lead us out and fast tracked us well in time for the pub pod arrival. Once inside, it literally felt like been stood by the bar at your local but with the best view in Britain... Absolutely stunning. Again, AJ, his bartending and general hosting were top notch. Do this! You won't regret it! 6 stars!",Experience the city in a bubble
"January 11, 2020","Very interesting concept. To be looking at the world around us. From above, in a capsule. Which is a little world of its own. People from all over the planet. All visiting London. Living without any differences. Good to do early in the day. Or late in the afternoon. As the city seems more alive under low light. Or in mid day. I have experience of all these parts of the day. As I have been on The Eye four times. And it’s not going to be my last experience of this phenomenal idea.",Cupid pod
"December 13, 2023","What a fantastic experience, all made by our amazing host Camilla. This was a special occasion and a surprise. It literally couldn’t have gone any better and Camilla played along brilliant. Also taking some amazing pictures and a video we will treasure forever. It’s expensive but worth every penny if it’s a special occasion",A must do  experience
"February 4, 2022","London Eye Champagne pod . Hosted by Claudia was Brilliant, both in knowledge and attention to detail. This was part of our wedding anniversary and will live long in the memory.  The views are amazing , and this is a must do experience when in the capital .",Organisation could have been better
"January 5, 2022","Went to London Eye today for 11am slot. Arrived at 10.45, and was still queuing to get on at 11.15. Staff were standing around chatting, and queue was not moving at all. Experience itself was fab. The views were spectacular, helped by the lovely bright sunshine today. I’m usually scared of heights but didn’t feel afraid in this at all. ","Perfect attraction, for adults and children"
"November 8, 2022","You have to climb at least once in your life. Tickets are around £39 per pardon but well worth it. I went in September and did not expect a long queue. Spectacular views across London. I have vertigo and it didn't scare me, it goes very slowly. I recommend it. Spacious cabins. Too bad Big Ben was under repair.",Great views of the city
"November 22, 2022",Great views of the city. We did it at night so was great to see London lit up. Bit pricey to go on a big wheel but it’s one of those experiences that you will remember. I would visit again during the day to see more landmarks and a different perspective.,Great attraction for all ages!
"October 5, 2020","The London Eye is a fascinating place to go if you are by tourism at London City . The view from the top is amazing and you can see the Big Bang and many other interesting places from there. This is a good tour because it's attractive for all ages, adults, teenagers, kids... One thing that I think is important to say about this ride is that near the entry of the London Eye  there are some places to buy ice cream and that's really nice , but there are not other restaurants there , so you need to plan to go to another place to eat or have lunch.  However it's a fantastic place and I really wanted everybody to have an opportunity to go visit there . I went there in June 2018 with my family, and we saw the sunset, it was amazing!",Amazing views at the correct time
"February 28, 2020","I booked the tickets for my brother,  sister in law and myself again :-) The time was perfect between sunset and early evening. It was perfect experience for them. The sky was clear and the views was incredible. Lovely time with family.",Sight seeing 
"September 12, 2020",Would recommend to book on line as cheaper and you get time slot.Temperature check before entering. Staff were friendly. Pods are spacious and limited amount people per pod.Views are spectacular. Takes about 30 minutes to go round.After leaving pod they cleaned. Worth a visit ,One of the most popular checkin points
"March 1, 2020","Takes a long time waiting in line for the tickets (booking on the web in advance is available) and the riding, but really worth it. See sunset shines the riverbank on top is a nice memory. Never miss it for first time visiting.",Good views
"August 7, 2021","Pre booked a visit, as we were a group of ten, got this as a deal with a river cruise. Well worth doing as there was no waiting to purchase tickets and didn’t have to queue for long at all. Great views of London at a nice slow pace.",Rather disappointing
"November 4, 2022","As someone who grew up near Disneyland, I suppose I expected more from The London Eye. Yes, I know it's slow moving, but I found myself pretty bored. Great views, but I could have been happy not going on it though my grown son liked it a lot. ",Fun for the first time visitor!
"March 15, 2020","The views are terrific and we enjoyed the ride.  Maybe a bit expensive but if you're in London, you have do it at least once.  Highly recommend booking ahead and getting the flex ticket.  We avoided a VERY long line.  ",Truly a disappointment.
"January 27, 2020",So expensive and so over-valued experience. Boring journey up and down seeing a lot of ugly buildings from the top (as they never were planned to be seen by their architectors). No particularly nice views in any direction.Truly disappointment.Impressive structure though.,A must do if you're in London!
"January 9, 2020",I've visited london many times but had never been on the london eye. My friend convinced me to do it and in the end I'm glad I did. The views are really good you can literally see every part of London. For someone who is not a big fan of heights it was even a really good experience for me! Even though the queues look massive they dont actually take that long to go down. Be warned though as when you get on the wheel doesn't stop each time. Definitely worth doing though! ,Well worth it
"March 13, 2020",This is something you should do when in London. There is plenty time to get a good look around the city when on here. Some great views. Only waited about 10-15 mins to get on and was definitely worth the wait. It’s high and noisy when windy but it’s worth the views. You will enjoy. ,Average experience 
"April 23, 2023","If you are doing this you should go here on your first day and as early as possible as the lines get really long. I'd say the London eye is overrated, but that is because I had already taken photos of the landmarks while on ground. It is a great place to take photos but after a while the photos start to look repetitive. If you are tired it is a good thing to do as there is a bench in the pod where you can sit for 30 minutes. I would recommend going here, however I personally don't feel the need to go back.",Eyeing the Capital 
"August 1, 2023","We pre-booked tickets online and were a few minutes early for our time slot, but the staff were happy to let us on following security checks. The views were stunning, and the weather was kind enough to let us see for miles. This is well worth the experience. ",Amazing 
"February 21, 2020","Worth every penny, feels safe and gives amazing views. Can see all across London. Staff are friendly and positive. Fast track definitely sped up our wait. Amazing experience and would recommend to all!",Five star to Staff Only
"July 23, 2021",The staff are amazing on this attraction. Their support and attention to care was unbelievable.  I have a son with learning disabilities. They actually stopped the wheel to ensure my son got on safely. I will say the wheel it’s self was not so brilliant. I would be so nice if there was a speaker to explain what we are seeing. Don’t think it’s worth the money but I could not fault the staff. Thank you for caring x,Glad I made it to the London Eye this time around
"October 15, 2023",It was my first time on the London Eye and the views were amazing.  I opted for the Fast Track ticket but in mid-September the regular queues seemed manageable.  Each car on the London Eye allow you to walk around and see different views with bench seating in the middle.  The entire ride was probably around 30 minutes or so.,STILL AMAZING
"July 19, 2021",We've done the London Eye a number of times and it never gets boring.  London is an amazing city and looks even better from the height of the Eye itself.  Book in advance and avoid the queues.,View to London upperair
"January 26, 2020","Nice views over London in the air. Queus were quite long, but it goes however smoothly. Possibility to get two kind of picture for nice memory of the visit! Recommended and one of the must sees in London IMO. ",One of the highlights
"July 26, 2022",We finished our London stay by booking the pub pod on the London Eye.  It was so much fun.  Not overcrowded.  A couple of fun drinks and of course a great view.  Sam was our bartender/guide and he just made sure all of us had fun.  He took pictures and made sure we had our drinks.   All the staff we met were friendly and helpful.  Although it isn't cheap it was well worth it.  Thanks so much Sam.,Overcame my fear - well nearly
"February 14, 2020",Waited years to go on the eye. I was brave and did it. Really enjoyed it. The views were phenomenal.Access was well organised.The 4D cinema experience was a good added extra too. ,Great view of London
"April 24, 2020",Fantastic ride at sunset. Great view. Saw House of Parliament. Depending on the day the queue is long but worth it . Nice surrounding area for a stroll. China is nearby can reach there by foot . West end is also nearby. ,Jameson’s Pub Experience
"April 3, 2022","My husband and I purchased the Pub Experience with Jameson’s. This was absolutely great! Our tour guide was called AJ, and he was fantastic. AJ really made the trip fun, informative and his cocktails were lovely! I would really recommend.",Lovely views
"August 3, 2021",This was a lovely way to see London. Lovely views and photo opportunities. Wouldn't visit again as once you've done it you've done it. Definitely worth a visit if never done before.,Great views
"February 29, 2020","Great views over the London skyline, but only if you get a good day.  Yay but staff are efficient getting you through security and onto the pods. Small kids might get bored, and remember there are no toilets on board!!!",Great tourist attraction 
"February 12, 2020",Had a fantastic time at the london eye with my 11 year old. He loved it! We did decide to pay for the que jump as we would have been waiting a long while in the cold.. but I think even if I had to wait I wouldnt have been disappointed.. great views and would reccomend to anyone visiting london!,A revisit after 20 years
"August 10, 2020","Still a fantastic attraction and even better as there are no queues courtesy of an awful disease. The views were fantastic as ever and we were blessed with fantastic cleat weather. The first, the biggest and still the best.",Go early in the morning to beat the crowds
"March 30, 2023",A wonderful way to take London in and appreciate the views of all of London's spectacular sites. The staff is friendly and we felt very safe the whole time.  The ticket booth is across the path from the eye so don't stand in line until you have your ticket.,Overall good
"August 22, 2022",Albeit a little expensive was really pleased we went on this attraction.  Was quite busy even with booking in advance but that was expected during summer holidays.  Got over my fear of heights !!!   Found green screen photo was rushed and not good quality and couldn't find our photo which was taken during the ride.  ,Finally got to see this in person - very nice!
"February 12, 2020",My wife and I spent our 10th wedding anniversary in London (first time). One of the bucket list items she wanted to do was to ride the London Eye to take in all the sights. We purchased the VIP experience package. The package included 2 free drinks before the ride as well as a fast pass to the London Eye itself - we bypassed a long line and had less than a 5 minute wait. We had our own private host (Adriana was excellent!) and there only 6 of us total in the pod. It holds up to 28 people! The ride lasted about 30 minutes and we were treated with champagne and a visual tour of the London skyline. Great time! ,Amazing attraction
"January 3, 2020","I have been with my fiancee over the london eye. The staff was professional, helpful and kind.We really enjoyed the attraction and we loved the 4d experience.On the dark side the eye's windows needed a good polish( that ruined on bit of the experience).Anyway we definitively advise it to everyone who wants to have a romantic/family experience on top of london",View of London
"April 6, 2023","If you want to see the sheer mass of London, then this ride is a must. The line went fast.. Was able to get a ticked just a few yards from the Eye. Carry your binoculars! There is alot to see, but far off!.",Worthwhile Wheel Ride
"October 15, 2023","We found the London Eye to be a very worthwhile endeavor during our stay in London. From above, the views are stunning, it gives you a better idea for the lay of the land, and it moves slow enough; which makes it not at all scary.  My only criticism is... I wish less people were in each pod that goes round.  Other than that, great views!!",1st trip! 
"September 23, 2023","Ist time on the eye, fast queuing system, around 10 people in capsule, Air con, plenty of room. Around 20 mins trip, great views of London.Recommended if you haven't done it. ",Great views of London
"March 1, 2020",We have been on the London Eye a few times and always good to do during the day and also evening when you see all the lights and London by night.It never gets boring and is great to see the London skyline change every few years.Not a cheap 15 minutes but worth it.,Great time
"February 8, 2020",Came on a day out to London for my friends birthday and was my first time on the London eye and it was a great experience we went on a Monday so.wasnt busy we got on the eye more or less straight away the staff were friendly.Going on the London eye was everything I expected and more and I'm looking forward to my next visit.,London Eye champagne room
"April 6, 2022","Went to London eye for a champagne room ride and we got the best tour guide ever, Arnie. He was so charismatic and knowledgeable, he really made the experience for us. So glad we went and I am especially glad we got Arnie, he was the best",Important Fact
"December 9, 2002","Riding the eye gives you a scenic view of London.  Parliament and Big Ben in particular.  It takes approximately 1/2 an hour to complete the rotation.  Very Important Fact!:  When they tell you to go to either side of your cubicle to take your picture...make sure you FACE OUT...there is NO camera ""in"" the cubicle.  Face the side where you will soon pass a sprial staircase. This is where the camera is.  We found this out the hardway, when after smiling at nothing for a minute...the camera went off 2 minutes later and took a picture of our backsides  :)Also..we went at night before closing. No lines!!!!  Great View!!!  Enjoy!!",No refunds!!!
"April 4, 2018","Our flight was canceled due to a snowstorm so we weren't able to fly out until the next day.  We had bought this ticket ahead of time for our first day in London but we arrived a day late due to the storm so we were unable to make it.  Since we knew we weren't going to make it, we called trip advisor and asked if we could change the date.  They said no and that all sales are final.  I'd understand if we were trying to cancel it but we only wanted to move it to two days later, they would still be getting their money. And it wasn't our fault our flight was canceled. We ended up just buying a ticket when we were there because it was still something we wanted to do.  However, do not buy this voucher if you aren't positive you will be able to make it because you will lose your money!!!",The 4D Experience was very good!
"May 1, 2012","We booked online, but had to collect our tickets. To collect our tickets there was about a 30 - 40 minute queue.  But we also got free entry into their 4D experience!  This was a fantastic little presentation showing the eye and London and just made me really appreciate where I was. We were curious as to why it was 4D? We of course expected the 3D glasses and things to pop out at you!  Well, I won't spoil the surprise of why its called 4D, but it was really awesome :)The trip up the eye itself was pretty good. About 20 minutes wait to jump into one of the pods.  There is a quick bag search before you get on. Then you just quickly get on it. I was expecting a bit more narration whilst inside the pod. But infact there really wasn't any.  There are some terminals you can use to have a look at what the sights are that you are seeing. But other than that, its pretty much up to yourself to just look out and enjoy.It was really nice to see that they don't stuff the pods too. These pods are big, and there was plenty of opportunity to walk around, take a seat without feeling like there was too many people in there. The views, as expected are pretty spectacular looking all over London. Gives you a better feeling of the geometry of the place. Looking at Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and Waterloo at the same time is not something you feel like you can do, when you explore london via the underground!",Disabled traveller discount
"September 6, 2010","It isn't advertised, but when buying tickets ask for a disabled traveller, and the carer goes free, plus you get free fast tracked too. Normal fast track price is £27 each, normal ticket £18 each.Normal price for 2 fast tracked tickets £54Total paid for fast tracked disabled over 60 and carer = £14  RESULT !!",Amazing
"August 31, 2023",Amazing view and feeling. Would highly recommend going . London is one the best cities in the world. Dont miss it!!!!!!!,Very Nice
"February 16, 2014",London Eye Trip is like being at the top of London. Its just superb. River Cruise was also great. Weather was sunny and so the overall experience was very nice.,Must do!
"June 25, 2005","On our recent trip to London, we debated over taking a trip on the London Eye. My husband thought it wasn't worth the 12.50 pounds for the half hour ride. However, the rest of our group wanted to go, so we did. It was well worth it! The views from this colossal ferris wheel are amazing. I actually thought about going again at night, so I could get the full Peter Pan ""Off to Neverland!"" effect! I would recommend going on a clear day or at night when the city is all lit up. For those who are scared:this is not a high speed thrill ride. You can hardly tell you are moving. There is no swinging action. I felt completely safe. You definitely should go! It was beautiful. Make sure you take your camera!",Expensive but it’s London. 
"December 28, 2019",We opted for the fast track tickets. From arrival to embarkation was 25 mins and this was peak time at Christmas. Great views and we caught the sunset. ,Breathtaking views--BUT reserve in advance!
"September 2, 2007","Once you are able to board your pod in the London eye, it is a wonderful 30-minute experience!  Amazing views of the Houses of Parliament, Thames River, St. Paul's, etc.  To make the most of the experience, we recommend that you try to minimize your time in line and in the ticketing/boarding area--very badly organized, crowded and chaotic!  Tips:  You can book tickets online up to 2 hours in advance of your ""flight.""  You need to be there at least a half hour before your flight time to pick up tickets.  The ""fast track"" ticket options avoid the lines, but are much more expensive.  A good mid-price choice we found was to choose the ""guided"" flight, where you have a staff member in your capsule who explains the sights.  It is a few more pounds per person, but you get to wait in a separate boarding area and are escorted right to boarding without waiting in the really long line forever.  The ticketing area is very confusing, crowded and loud, and the traffic flow inside is terribly planned.  If you have reserved tickets online with a credit card, we found that you can pick them up/have them printed out simply by inserting your credit card into one of the machines directly inside the doorway to the right.  No sign or person will tell you this, but if you have a ""guided"" flight, you can then go to the back entrance of the ticketing office, where there is a waiting lounge for guided flights.  The movement of the wheel is very slow, and did not bother someone in our party who was afraid of heights.  There is a bench in each pod and they are air-conditioned.  At the end of your flight, they offer to take your picture--for 10 pounds, you get a photo of your party in your pod, and a photo fridge magnet & key chain.  Yeah, touristy and like Disneyland, but unique.  Be sure to get close to the glass and spread out so you can see everyone, and smile--the guides do tell you in advance, but don't bunch up!!!Outside on the riverfront between the Eye and Waterloo station, there are many street performers on the weekend if the weather is nice, who are glad to pose for photos with people or kids.  There is also a small cafe selling drinks and snacks while you are waiting.  If you have regular flight tickets--be forewarned--this is one of the most popular attractions in London and the lines are LONG!  If you have kids in tow, just be prepared for the wait.",Book the Discovery Flight! Well worth the money
"August 16, 2005","I booked a discovery flight on the BA London Eye website, which at GBP 13.50 costs one pound more than the normal ticket. The only small disadvantage of this is you have to fix the date and time (six times a day, every hour from 11.30 to 16.30) beforehand. Once you have your e-ticket, you can show up just 10-15 minutes before the flight and bypass the long queue in front of the ticket office and go to the innermost counter to get your proper ticket. Then you'll be escorted to the capsule (no queue here either) by your guide who will point out famous landmarks and give you some interesting London history. At the time we went, there were 13 people having booked this flight. Even though they can accommodate upto 15 people for a discovery flight, they devided us into two capsules. As such, in our capsule, there were our family of four, a mom and her daughter, and the guide. Towards the end of the flight, there will be two cameras to capture you from outside. Our guide instructed each family to go the each end of the capsule where the cameras would be zooming and as a result we had a wonderful photo of only our family in the capsule.I highly recommend this for a worthwhile London Eye visit, especially if you plan to go during summer or public holidays.",A relaxing view from the River Thames
"August 8, 2018","Pay the extra fiver to jump the queue, its worth it. Our guide was pleasant, funny and knew her stuff. A nice relaxing way to see parts of London. The seats are roomy with plenty of leg room. All staff are friendly and polite. Worth a trip and worth the money",Buy online tickets
"July 9, 2018",Go for 5 for fifty attraction.... This will definitely save your time as well as money...No more standing in queue for buying tickets.,"4 Stars: To say ""I rode the London Eye"""
"March 13, 2016","I think it's a very touristy thing to do and quite expensive for a ""ferris wheel"" ride but as a tourist, it's one of those things you have to try.  We got there at a good time.  There were only 6 of us in a capsule.  It's a 30 min ride for a full circle.  Get there right before the sun sets and you get to appreciate the scenic view more.",Premium Merlin Pass Holder...no queue! 
"March 14, 2015","Single dad with two kids aged 3 and 12. We had a great time in London but our highlight was the trip to The London Eye. We didn't do the 4D ad my youngest not keen. No need to book as we have premium merlin passes. The queue was long but we just walked on through the priority pass entrance. Please note that your pass needs to be premium. If you use the family and friends option they would get the same privileges as your premium pass.On the 'flight' they have four Samsung Galaxy Tabs positioned in the four corners. These provided a reference for points of interest. You can even choose a night mode if required. These were great and my eldest enjoyed spotting the many places.  My son just wanted to play on them but did keep him entertained. The experience is about 30 mins and the capsule isnt overly crammed with people so its comfortable.  Price is expensive so i would consider the passes as these last a year and include lots of venues throughout the uk. We also visited the Sea Life, Tussauds and the Dungeons are also near the eye if you wish to visit. The Shrek attraction will be open in the summer with entry included for premium pass holders from Sept 3015. Use the waterloo station as only 300 yards from the London Eye. ",A must visit spot
"February 20, 2005",Just visited the London eye. It's a great place to start your London holiday. Yes there lines seem to be super long but it is actually a fast line considering the number of people. I spent about 25 minutes and it's a great place to hear different accents going on all around you. The wheel takes about 25 minutes to go all around where you get a great view of the capital. Well worth the price and time spent. Give it a chance.,Not a good thing for London
"September 5, 2003","It certainly does not do London a favor. It lets you see all the architecture, good and bad, and what a mess it has become. St. Pauls is now only a small spot and you really have to look to find it. I believe the building code has gotten out of hand. But then, you say, where do you put all the businesses? They could live without so many. The Londoners that we talked to do not like the ""Eye"" either. It looks out of place, but since it is making money off the tourists, I suppose it will stay.",Book tickets online to Save time.
"July 18, 2015",We enjoyed a lot. The weather was good when we visited there. Got a very nice view of London. We had booked the ticket online so we saved time there.,1 word to describe it: Beautiful
"August 25, 2012","I have been on the London Eye with my family many times and have absolutely loved it! If you ever visit London you must go on the Eye, it is a great experience with absolutely fantastic views! It is a great way to admire the whole of London. NOTE: the tickets are quite expensive and there usually is a big queue, my family got it for free because we had special passes. It is deffinitely worth it. The ride is beautiful.I hope you found this review useful :)Thank you for reading. :D",What a con
"July 15, 2011","Ok, pre book, queue for a ticket, queue to get on.....for many hoursIf you have a deisre to stand in a queue with no idea as to how long then enjoy, the queue is long so you pay on top of what you have already paid to jump it, in our case an adult and 2 children paid nearly £50, why so much????",Great views
"July 17, 2005",Great views up there but you need to stay at the top for a bit longer so you can absorb it all from such a height. The que can be quite long but it did move rather fast. Go up on a clear day you get to see more this way. I went up during the day but apparently a night time flight is wonderful. They have a camera towards the end where you can have a picture taken and buy it if you desire. A fantastic time. Do Not leave London without going on!,Expensive but it’s London. 
"December 28, 2019",We opted for the fast track tickets. From arrival to embarkation was 25 mins and this was peak time at Christmas. Great views and we caught the sunset. ,Breathtaking views--BUT reserve in advance!
"September 2, 2007","Once you are able to board your pod in the London eye, it is a wonderful 30-minute experience!

"June 26, 2005","I have just visited London and the London Eye. I booked beforehand on the internet. If you book for an escorted visit (ie someone to tell you what you're looking at) it costs an extra £2.50 but is worth it because you go straight to the front of the queue, and there is a good chance that the visit will not be booked up so you will have more room in your capsule. If you choose to take your chances when you get to London, don't be put off by the size of the queue as it goes down pretty quickly!",Wonderful experience
"March 24, 2005","Really great ride. It takes 30 mins to go round slowly, so you get to see everything. The views of London are fantastic, and I'm really pleased i did it! Oh and there's a really great crepe and juice stall a 5 min walk from it outside Westminster tube!!",Breathtaking
"February 26, 2006",just got back from London and the Eye was one of our fisrts stops.. it is great we had prebooked an early flight(10am) and had a capsule to ourselves so our party of five had a good view all the time..just stunning as it was a clear day. worth every penny.,So good I've done it twice
"March 11, 2005","I would implore anybody going to London to do this at least once. It is better to buy tickets in advance, especially in peak season, but what I like about this is that the pods are surprisingly spacious and you have plenty of space to move around and take photos from all angles. Buy the book before you go so you know what direction to look in and what you are seeing, so are obvious; Buckinham Palace, the Gherkin, but others aren't. As they say in the song, on a clear day you can see forever and old father Thames winds and winds into the distance.  Just amazing.  I cannot recommend this highly enough.",Family Trip before the Marathon
"April 28, 2016",We pre-booked tickets to this attraction and changed the visit date on the day the staff were excellent and it only cost £10 to change all the tickets. It was a fantastic experience I would defiantly recommend doing this at dusk when all the buildings are light up. The views were spectacular. I would definitely recommend going at this time I personally don't think the views would be as spectacular during the daytime,One of the best attractions in London
"November 1, 2005","As a born and bred Londoner, I like to take advantage of the sights and museums every now and again and I also have a lot of foreign relatives who I show around. Having been to have ridiculous amount of attractions in London, I can safely say the London Eye in one of the best things to do... as long as you have a head for heights. Those who are worried about being sick, shouldn't be. It moves v v slowly and its a gentle 30 min ride. I've been on the Eye about 4/5 times over the years and I can recommend sunset as the best time. Sunset and sunrise near the Thames is a stunning sight and London looks beautiful as all the lights come on. As long as the weather is clear, you can see the dome, Harrow on the Hill, basically parts of London from 10 miles away. The queues may look scary, but they're v fast moving and if you spend more than 30 mins max (and that's just in June-Aug peak time) I'd be v surprised. Well worth the money. Afterwards take a walk down (east directon) the river to Gabriel's Wharf for some cute boutiques, great restaurents or rent some rollerblades or a bicycle.",Loved the Eye!
"March 17, 2005","My husband and I went to the Eye on our second day there.  We took our first trip on the tube to get there and what a neat experience it was!  We were coming from the Hyde Park area and had no idea what we were doing but learned fast.  It was fun just learning how to get there.  The Eye is amazing as it really gives you an overview of the whole London area.  It was a bit overcast that day, yet you could still see the many landmarks that London is so famous for.  Plus that, it is a good focal point.  When we were at other locations around town, we could always look for the Eye and kind of figure out where we were.  It is a must see when you are there!  I have heard it is better to buy tickets before hand, however we didn't do that.  I think it cost around $20-$25 USD and the only discounts they were giving were for seniors.  Whatever, definately worth it!  Jolly good fun!",Great views
"July 11, 2005","We went July/05.  I booked the ticket online and just picked them up the day of the flight.  I avoided the lineups.  I also booked the early flights, there are far less people early in the morning than later in the morning or afternoon.  We only had 7 people in our capsule, which is great because you can move about freely!",Well worth the money
"July 8, 2005","The London Eye gives a really unique view of London and is well worth the time and effort.As a previous reviewer said, dont be put off by the large queue as they sell tickets at a frantic rate and this queue soon goes down even at peak times. Also as each capsule can take up to 30 people, boarding also moves at a fair pace.The best thing about the Eye is that not only can you see a large percentage of the City but you also get a real appreciation of the history as the aerial view shows the 'rings' of development over the ages.I have done the Eye during the day and it is excellent but for me the best way to see it is at sunset.  I would recommend checking the sunset time for the day and then booking a flight that starts 15 mins before.  That way you get dusk photos on the way up, sunset at the top and night shots on the way down .. you cant beat it!  We had some excellent photos but unfortunately I dont have them digitally to add to this review.",HOTEL CHOCOLAT TASTING EXPERIENCE REVIEW
"October 13, 2015","Words will not be able to express the value for money nor how truly amazing this London attraction was, but I will give it a try. Out of all the places I seen and all the tours I went on while in the capital city, this had to have been my favorite.For a mere 50₤ (that's approximately 77USD), you will receive a box of chocolates to take home with you, priority boarding, two complete revolutions on the London Eye, all the champagne you can drink (even though the online description says 2 glasses, they kept pouring us all we wanted), about 15 different types of chocolates and truffles onboard to sample, and a personal chocolatier to teach you all there is to know about chocolate.As far as the price, if you compare the costs for the different types of tickets you will see how much of a bargain this is. An online booking discount saves you anywhere from 15 to 20% on tickets depending on the tour you choose. The prices I quote are with that discount. A standard ticket costs 19₤ (about 29USD). That includes one complete revolution (1 revolution = 30 minutes) with no priority boarding. No onboard goodies either. Fast Track tickets cost 29₤ (about 43USD). Same as standard tickets, but here you get priority boarding. Champagne Experience tickets also cost 29₤ (about 43USD). Same as Fast Track tickets, but here you get 1 glass of wine to enjoy while on the ride. For 21₤ more (about 31USD), the Hotel Chocolat Tasting Experience tickets include everything in the Champagne Experience, but the chocolate experience tickets include more wine, an extra revolution (that's one hour as opposed to the regular 30 minutes), chocolates chocolates and more chocolates. Even a box of chocolates to take home! That extra cost alone covers the additional revolution if you were buying tickets separately! For the extra money you are not only getting that extra revolution, but you are getting so much more in return. Well worth the extra money! There is limited space on the specialty tickets, so try to book well in advance. Now as far as the memories you will forever be able to keep, when you arrive at the London Eye you will proceed to the Priority Desk for collection of your tickets. This building is located to the left of the general admission booth. They will give you a Hotel Chocolat goodie bag while they are printing your tickets. Then, you will wait in a private area located inside the café until your tour begins. When that time does arrive, a London Eye staff member will greet you in the café and take you on your journey. You will go around the huge lines directly up to a capsule bypassing everyone else. As you go around two complete revolutions, you will learn about chocolates, samples chocolates, enjoy some champagne, all while taking in the breathtaking London skyline. It's something you will cherish forever.In Paris, I will never forget the Eiffel Tower. Rome, the Colosseum. Budapest, the baths. But in London, it unquestionably will be the time I had on the London Eye!! I highly recommend it (even if you don't go on the chocolate tour).",Shambles!!!
"July 14, 2011","As we were visiting friends near london we decided to visit the london eye, BIG MISTAKE!  All I can say is that it was an utter shambles.  when we first arrived the queue was huge but as it was early we decided to give it a go.  30 mins later it broke down, not one of the many staff said a thing but another visitor gave us a number we could ring later in the day to see if it was up and running.We continued with our day and after ringing we returned at 3pm.  One of the staff told us it would be a 35 min wait so we were quite happy with that.  2 and a half hours later we actually got on the eye!!!!  The queuing system was a shambles and the staff who were supposed to be controlling it could not of cared less.  It really was awful and an embarassment to anyone english.  The ride itself was ok but ruined by the marathon wait.  Never again!!",Go see the view from St. Paul's instead
"January 5, 2007","We thought about seeing the London Eye in Aug.'06, but the long lines (2, in fact -- one to buy tickets; one to get on the Eye) and the high price dissuaded us. One can get a far better view of London (and a larger overall view), by going to St. Paul's Cathedral. Admission to the cathedral is about 1/4 the price. After viewing the interior and the Whispering Gallery, one can take stairs up inside the dome to 2 different exterior levels.One caveat is that one has to climb a lot of stairs, but the views are fabulous, and well worth the effort. Unlike the Eye, where one can only see a small part of London from across the Thames from Parliament, from atop St. Paul's, one can see the whole sweep of London. Being in the centre of the old City of London, one can see all of the original city, with views across the Thames to the Tate Modern and the Globe.This is a real bargain!",Buy the timed entry ticket
"September 16, 2006","The queues can be horribly long at times so be aware of that before you go.  You can purchase a ""timed"" ticket which lets you show up at a specified time and bypass the horribly long ""standard"" line.  Yes, the timed ticket is a little more expensive,  but if you have access to the internet you can buy your tickets directly from their website and save 10%. The eye is built on the banks of the Thames right at the Marriott County Hall Hotel which can be rather overpriced.  There are some good deals to be had on the weekend rates.  Savvy and budget travelers will probably want to stay in the Premier Travel Inn London County Hall...same building as the Marriott but at 1/2 the price!  hint:  there is an internet cafe directly across the street from the entrance door to the Premier Travel Inn County Hall where you can purchase your timed tickets at 10% savings.",Good thing to do
"January 21, 2006","I booked my flight before I left for England. I had heard from friends that doing it at night was awesome. So I went with that. When I went on a Monday evening in January it was pretty empty. My capsule was just me and a couple. Anyway at 6PM the views of the city all lit up were amazing. I would do this it doesn't take much time 30 minutes plus some waiting if it's busy and it's not too expensive, only about 12 pounds. I would pass on the panoramic guidebook though as it's pretty useless. It costs 3 pounds and you can pick out the buildings that it tells you about.",Bargain prices this time of year
"August 14, 2005","At the moment, a certain website that contains the words last and minute are doing a great deal.  Yesterday, I went on the London Eye and also the London Eye Riverboat Cruise for a grand sum of just over £11.  The cruise is 40mins and comfortable and interesting.  Really don't think I need to comment on the London Eye!  Book it ASAP!",Birds Eye View
"September 20, 2003","The only disappointing thing about this ""Wheel of London"" or ""London Wheel"" as it used to be called and is now known as ""The London Eye"" is that it truly does not seem to fit with the scenery around it. But then again, neither do any of the modern buildings that have replaced some of the more beautful classical ones. The wheel at least does have a history here and has been around in some shape or form for over 100 years. It is a part of the city's history and it has an incredible view of the city from it. You can see all the historical landmarks from one central location. Some of the best pictures you will be able to take of the city will be from your 40 minute turn around the wheel. It's definitely well worth it and I would recommend it to anyone who is visiting London.",Saddly no champagne
"October 17, 2021","We were set on the champagne experience, however when we walked up to the Visitor Center at 11 AM on a weekday to buy tickets from the terminal there, it appeared that the only time slots at 3 and 4 PM  were all filled up. We bought standard tickets, still pricey, and waited in slow moving line for about 30 minutes. Before you board your pod, the crew checks it for any gross dirt or objects left behind, sweeps if necessary, but they do not spray or wipe anything. We had about 10 people in our pod, some were sitting on the bench in the center, most were standing and admiring the view for 30 minutes. We were lucky to have a clear day so it was exciting to see the Buckingham Palace and such from the Eye. Restrooms are available at the Visitor Center and Fish and Chips restaurant is nearby.",get a combo ticket!
"May 16, 2012","if you dont like to queue, there are fast track option avaialble. Get a combo ticket as you DO actually save money, which we worked out at £30 for 2 of us over the weekend.The eye its self takes around 30 mins all in, and provides great views of central london. We were lucky to have a carriage to oursleves as we stayed in the Premier Inn next to the eye and were the first on the ride in the morning. It opens around 9, and gets busy as sson as it opens",Marvellous views of London!
"May 1, 2012","Having booked E tickets for a group several times, the collection of the actual tickets was quite swift.. This was April and not too busy so we didn't wait long to get inside 'the pod'! It can take a while in the busy Summer season but is well worth it. I'd recommend booking a 'flight' at sunset !!! Wonderful !",Best views in town

"January 21, 2012","My husband and I went to London Eye and we found the Views to be wonderful. We were able to see the different attractions such as big Ben, house of parliament, London tower, and the river Thames. We found it to be enjoyable and relaxing.

"January 9, 2012","We were torn as to go during a clear do or to go at night.As it turned out, we ran out of day and had to go at night.  Our advanced ticket (good anytime that day) was a blessing when it was time to get into line for the ride.The views were very nice at night, but the pictures were disappointing.  If you want to go for the pictures, go during a clear day.I recommend this attraction but not enough ""wow factor"" to go a second time.",A little expensive
"October 12, 2011","Do not get bogged down by the title. It depends on what kind of things attract you.  I was personally a little disappointed with the snail paced giant wheel. Also the whole point of the ride was to get a view of London from the top.  I went with a couple of friends and they shared the same thought.  Take it if  you are the kind of person who enjoys aerial view and stuff like that. Also, I could see a lot of kids getting excite. For me especially at that price, it is thumbs downNote: Check out the london attraction pass which combines London eye with Madame Tussauds, sea life, thames cruise and other combinations. If you book it online, you can avoid the long queue and get some discount too.",Amazing!
"October 8, 2011","We only had standard tickets, and were prepared for a long wait in the queue before we arrived. However, we were so surprised to see how short the main queue was on arrival, and it only took about 25 min to get onboard. Great, considering it was a saturday afternoon! The kids were fascinated by the fantastic views and since our capsule was not too crowded it was easy to get a good look. Really enjoyable experience! In fact, we visited three main London attractions that day, the dungeon, the london eye and Sea Life Aquarium, and the kids all agreed that the London Eye was the best part of the day!",Mirian Does London
"July 16, 2011",The London Eye is a must see.  The views are incredulous.  You must do the 4D experience which is included in the ticket cost.  We followed our trip on the Big Red Bus blue route - lots of languages to choose from on the commentary.  Then we did the Boat trip to Greenwich and back (from Westminster Bridge) included with the Bus ticket. To see the pictures  go to :http://photopeach.com/album/13t4jxq?invitecode=763b37223c,Definitely go for the VIP
"June 29, 2011","We bought our tickets online prior to our trip, and opted for the basic VIP package. Nothing fancy, but allows you to skip the queue. I think it wound up only costing 2 pounds more than the regular admission bought on site (you get additional savings online). When we arrived on a beautiful sunny afternoon, the lineup was horrific. We were able to walk right up to guest services, grab our reserved tickets, and then go through a separate entrance and were on board in less than 5 minutes. I'm sure the line was at least 2 hours! You also get a cool circular map that shows you all of the major landmarks you will see from the top.The London Eye is just one of those typical touristy things that you have to do in London. Great city views and it's a cool experience.",Book online. Be prepared for cloud!
"March 10, 2011","The notorious british weather can really throw a spanner in the works. Unless it is foggy you should still be able to see as far as St Paul's and easily see Big Ben/Parliament as it is opposite!The ride moves so slowly you do not feel the movement; takes a good 20 minutes to go round. worth it if your first time to London. Lovely setting, good place from where to get perspective. And if your glass is half full, a cloudy day may not be bad. If the sun was out you would not be able to take photos in one direction because of the glare and it would reflect off the glass of the bubble. So yes, go for a cloudy day!!! Hopefully you don't end up with one of the two sunny days a year in England!No, really, enjoy it. Worth it.Hey kids: Big Ben/Parliament...",TERRIBLE. BAD MANAGEMENT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.
"June 14, 2023","If I could rate it a 0 I probably would. The last time I tried to go on the Eye they sold us tickets through their website for a time that didn’t exist and we watched it close right in front of us. They then refused let us ride and we had to beg for a refund. It was a very bad experience and I was reluctant to go back ever. We tried again this June and although the views were beautiful while we were up there I don’t know that it was worth the miserable experience to get up there.  We were 10 minutes early for our slot and we were yelled out of the line by their rude staff. We complied and stepped out of the line… twice. Then, when our cue time was called we were pushed to the back and watched as they allowed 50+ students in a tour group pushed to the front as they cut everyone that had been waiting. After we mentioned it to staff they were EXTREMELY rude and unhelpful. It was hot, the line was long and they continued helping the student sneak in front of us. All the staff was yelling at people and were very very rude. The queue line was very long and since you couldn’t get into the line until exactly your queue line we actually didn’t even get on the Eye until over an hour past the time listed on our ticket. Everything was super unorganized. 0/10 customer service. After our awful experience we went to speak with management and they did NOTHING and were rude as well. I am never one to give a bad review or even speak up but this was the worst experience possible. I will NEVER be back. ","High cost, long lines (felt oversold), non refundable - meh"
"June 14, 2023","Tl;dr - Did it because our kids wanted to but the line queue, lack of refundable tickets and high cost didn’t really give us a good experience. If you have other things to see on your trip and cost is a factor steer clear of this one…..Make sure you read the FAQs, the time slot you buy still results in an average wait time of 45min (it was 1:15 for us) when you join the queue.  For someone not from the area or familiar with the experience this can be confusing and might not work with your timing if you have other things to do… Non-refundable so if the queue is long and you can’t afford the time to wait well… you’re out £150 for a family of 4 for the basic experience.  They will be happy to upsell you to spend more for fast track (which was no longer available in our case) which  makes you feel trapped to pay it to save the day when the line is ridiculously long… we stuck through it for the kids sake. The view was nice",Learned a lot...
"June 13, 2023","So fun...but it was sunny!  We were blessed with perfect weather and an outstanding crew.  The narrator (sorry, forgot his name) was perfect.You all did a great job!",Highly recommend
"June 13, 2023","We choose the VIP experience with champagne. We had pre booked, but then had a mishap with the Uber driver taking us to the wrong address… so we arrived at the very last minute. I was worried we wouldn’t be let on as you’re supposed to get there 15 minutes early to check in. The first person we came across with a London Eye badge outside the ticket office was so friendly, and immediately rushed us to the right place & checked we could still make it on. We were then greeted by various friendly employees who made us feel very special.Charlie & Beatrice were our guides on the pod, and they couldn’t have been nicer. They made it feel like a real VIP experience,  and also knew all about the structure & the city views.Loved this experience !",Champagne experience 
"June 13, 2023","The london eye is terribly crowded and noisy.  Expect an hour of waiting at least in general admission. We got an entry in 15 minutes due to champagne experience ticket. (Same applies to fast track tickets). Air-conditioning in the pod switched off in a few minutes.  The views are excellent. However the staff inside does not really give you any information. They are there just to give you champagne. IMHO, there is no point in shelling 7 £ extra for a glass of champagne.  ",Great views!
"June 13, 2023",Loved it!  This was pur first activity in London. Great views and everything ran smoothly. Very organized even though there were tons people. Arrive 30 min prior to get on at your scheduled time. Lines move quickly. Super fun!,Bit disappointed 
"June 12, 2023","Pre booked, so did pay a bit less. Arrived earlier than booked for but was allowed on as it wasn't too busy.Air conditioning in the pod was nice as it was 31 degrees outside. Beautiful views, but we all thought it needed some form of information on pointing out the landmarks for us out of towners. Overall, been done, won't do it again as very overpriced for what it is in our view.",Really enjoyed the london Eye it was quite a view !

"June 11, 2023","My wife used our Merlin passes to book a ride on the London Eye + River Cruise, as part of an outing to celebrate my birthday. We were impressed at how efficiently everything ran, & a good time was had by all. Can't fault the experience.",Average to not to say poor experience
"June 10, 2023","The experience was average to not to say poor, we felt like it was a turist trap, we bought the fast track line, had to wait more than half hour past the  starting time to go inside, but if it was just that it would be okay, inside they put in way more people that would be comfortable, a few could seat and the rest had to stand, the ones that were sitting or not lucky enough to be by the window couldn’t see almost anything, plus it was so hot and only 2 weak and small aircos inside, that only refreshed the ones standing under them, if you were on the other side you felt like cooking inside an oven.Bottom line, not a good experience considering the price paid, almost 40 euros per person.",Buy straight from attraction.
"May 21, 2023",Booked through mylondonpass.   Tickets never received.  I placed the order at 5pm and received an acknowledgment indicating tickets would arrive within an hour.

Eventually they responded that they were unable to obtain the tickets.   Buy directly instead.,Great time for young family

"May 20, 2023",Getting tickets was a bit of a pain. Long queues and not particularly friendly staff. The long queues to board the wheel were expected for such a popular attraction,Best experience ever
"May 20, 2023",This was an amazing experience because it was a lot of nice views of London my children really enjoyed the views and I was very impressed by the views,Great river tour
"May 20, 2023","Had a lovely river boat cruise with 12 visitors from South Korea.  Harrison was our guide and he was very good, with lots of facts about the river and the buildings running alongside it.  He did speak very quickly and although our visitors were fluent in English, he spoke a bit too quickly for them to understand everything - lots of 'in' jokes as well which international visitors would not understand.  Unfortunately, even though our tickets were pre-booked, we were unable to sit together with five of our group having to sit in the lower deck, so their view of the sights was obstructed and photo opportunities were less than sitting on the outside deck, which was a shame.  However, a lovely way to spend 35 minutes - our visitors particularly enjoyed seeing Tower Bridge.",Tracy is awesome!
"May 19, 2023","Absolutely worth it. First, let me shout out the worker who made our experience even more amazing than it would have been. Her name is Tracy. Tracy, if you see this, kudos to you!! You turned what could have been an experience our daughter would have been upset about into a highlight of our trip. You went out of your way to make our time at the London Eye an incredible memory of a lifetime. To the managers of the London Eye, Tracy deserves whatever kind of kudos you can offer! Absolutely made our whole trip with how she treated us like family. Amazing human! Oh and the view was breathtaking lol.",Beautiful views!

"May 19, 2023","As soon as I dropped off my luggage at the hotel, I headed for the London Eye to get a bird’s eye view of my home for the next week. I bought the Fast Track Flex pass, so I wasn’t constrained with meeting a timeline. Perfect choice! Easy to find, easy to board, loved the views!!  Highly recommend it as a first stop on any tour of London. ",Not worth the time or money
"May 16, 2023","My Wife and I did the London eye. We basically did it just because we didn't know if we'd regret not having done it if we didn't .  It's definitely not worth the money . $100 U.S. for 2.  It was just ok , nothing special. We went on a Monday evening about 5:30 PM. We didn't have a very long line at all and what line we had moved quickly. I really would have not been happy  if  we had spent a long time in line and spent $100. The view is ok but nothing spectacular. Save your money and do something else with your time and money",Lovely views
"August 17, 2015","As we visited in August, buying a queueline skip ticket paid for itself! Main queue was over 30 minutes while we waited just five. Once on the Eye, we were treated to 360 degree views of central London.",Do not purchase an annual merlin pass
"August 4, 2015",After travelling from the North to London on early Saturday morning for a family fun day visiting the attractions we were amazed at being refused entry with our Merlin annual pass because they couldn't be used in August. I sent a tweet to Merlin and their response was pathetic.To add to insult the email response was outrageous. They attempted to up sell the premium annual pass so i could visit attractions in August. Shoddy customer service. My friends and family who have previously asked about the annual pass have been informed that they should read the T&Cs...,Save your money and go up The Shard or Tower Bridge instead!
"August 1, 2015","Whilst the view from the top is undeniably great, you can get similar from any tall attraction in the area. The queues are long, the staff are ineffective at best (I am being extremely polite in that statement) and the cost is extortionate. On the day we  went (family of 2+2) the very cheapest ticket was £66, the queue was an hour long, the 4d experience was closed for fire alarm testing (seriously?!?!...this isn't a 24/7 operation, why can't they do this out of hours) and the toilets (both ladies and gents) were closed for cleaning leaving a 50 strong queue for the ONE disabled loo that was open. Poor poor management and overcharging from start to finish. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone! ",Exhilarating Experience at the London Eye!
"July 28, 2015","I've been on this before but this was when it first was such a new things (all those years ago.. no I'm not that old..lol), the queues are toooooooooo long but if you book in advance you can skip the queue (cost a bit more) but definitely worth it!It would have been even better if we had our own capsule but its fine I don't mind sharing with others!..lolThe views are just amazing if the weather is nice you can look far afield - The whole experience lasts around about 30 mins which in my view its enough although at one point i had hoped it would go really fast like a theme park ride,.,, OMG... imagine if they had converted it to that at a later stage??!.. I would be number one in the queue!..lolJokes aside, its definitely worth a visit but be prepared for the long queues and make sure you go on a warm/clear and sunny day!",Great River Tour on the Thames
"July 4, 2015","My wife and I took the Thames River cruise operated by the London Eye!  We thought it was a great cruise, from the easy boarding to the commentary by the knowledgeable young lady to the length of the cruise.  I'd recommend this cruise to anyone!",Cool but overpriced
"June 17, 2015","The views were great but I thought they overpriced the tickets. Get there early because lines can get very long. We waited about 30-40min.

"June 13, 2015","We booked the Fully Flexi Fast Track Ticket which gave us one time access during a specific week. We were free to show up on whichever day and time during that week that suited us most and did not have to queue. Within 10 minutes of our arrival we boarded the London Eye. The tickets are expensive but I think if you have guests you don't want to spend an hour waiting in a queue, so I'd recommend the Fully Flexible Fast track ticket.",overrated & overpriced
"April 6, 2015","overrated & overpricedLondon is not on my list of ""must view from observatory"" cities.Dubai , Singapore, NYC, Abu Dhabi, Seoul and a few others but definitely not London.Then theres the price.

"June 24, 2007","not good  at all,to be honest i feel it is an enlarged ferris  wheel which is given tooo much publicity",Only if you've got the time and money
"May 25, 2007","After reading all the glowing reviews on trip advisor I made sure to book online when arriving in London to make sure we could get on board without queueing.  It was all organised when we got there, no problem, didn't have to wait long to get on.We were also lucky in that we only had to share the capsule with one other couple so had great access and unimpeded views.  It was good, but it's not like you can take great photos as the capsules are that scratched up plastic material.I would only recommend it to those with heaps of time and the money to spare, it's not a must see or do in London.  I'd rather recommend St Pauls where the views are just as brilliant with no perspex between me and the view (plus all the other St Pauls benefits).","Fantastic, leisurely way to see a big city"
"April 2, 2007","The London Eye has become this incredible sight that, since 2000, has really earned a place on the skyline of London. One can scarcely imagine the South side of the Thames without it anymore. It is the world’s largest observation wheel and gives a unique view of London. We booked our tickets on-line in advance and got a fairly decent price. We arrived a little after the recommend time, but this being a Monday morning, the line was fairly short (<5 minutes). I highly recommend coming earlier in the day as the queue really starts growing with tourists and school groups after 12 noon. We had a beautiful, clear, sunny day and the flight was great, but I think even a cloudy day might still be fun. A nighttime flight must be amazing!To say that the “flight” is fantastic, gorgeous, wonderful and exhilarating would not be overselling it! The Eye itself is a thrilling technological and engineering sight. The wheel moves smoothly and effortlessly and the clear capsules give a remarkable view. The one downside is that there is no map, no narration, no displays, so it is often hard to understand what you are seeing. With other observation wheels or towers like the Washington Monument or Empire State Building, there is usually some kind of signage that tells you what you are seeing. On the London Eye, you are left to wonder – what is that funny large building over on the right (it was The Gherkin), or where is Trellick Tower? And since most of your fellow travelers are also tourists – they don’t have a clue either. It would really add to this experience to have signage that helped you understand what you are looking at.That aside, the London Eye is a fantastic way to seeing one of the world’s largest, more complicated cities at a leisurely pace.","Out of this World, Brilliant, Fantastic and Impressive"
"March 14, 2007","The BA London Eye is truly the number one attraction in Britain. I did the 30 minute trip on March 9 about 2:30 p.m. It’s a short distance away from the Waterloo Station so you better get a train there. The weather was fantastic, a bit chilly and there wasn’t heavy cloud cover. I bought the ticket for £14.50 and just had to wait about 20 minutes before I was able to enter a capsule. The lines are long but they move fast. Security is efficient and once you follow the rules you’ll be through quickly. I also got a guide book for £5 just before I got on with all the views you’ll see and it identified exactly what each was. This was really helpful. Just look at the pictures I’ve attached and see the breathtaking views to be had. There were only 16 people in my capsule and there was enough room for everyone to get around and take loads of pictures. My Sony DC was good enough to zoom in and take a good picture of Buckingham Palace. After the ride, I went into the Gift Shop to get myself some souvenirs. I got some nice chocolate for £1.50 each. Also, a BA draw string bag with a monocular, guide book and key ring for £13.50. I got my friend a mouse pad as well, can’t remember the cost. Overall, it is worth it. I would recommend it to anyone, old and young. Don’t be afraid of the height, it’s only 450 feet above the ground at its highest point. What’s more, the Eye moves so slowing, you barely notice it’s moving. If you stand from Westminster Bridge it looks like if it’s static. On another note, I categorically disagree with the views here that it is overrated and overpriced. That project cost millions of pounds to conceptualise and develop and millions more to maintain yearly. This piece of engineering magic is a definite on your next trip to London.",A must for tourist
"October 20, 2006",Been both in day time and night time. There was a full moon so it looked amazing. Remember to turn camera flash off so you dont get light bouncing off the glass. Yes there are queues and waits but isnt it the same for every tourist attraction in the world? I've had to wait longer for attractions in the states. If you are not in london for long i would do the Eye as you get a birdseye view of the city and you can really take it in. I dont think i realised how beautiful London is (kind of took it for granted living in the next county) until i went up the Eye both times. Then i realised how lucky i was and why people come from all over the world to visit it. It has history and beauty all visible from your pod.,The Queue was long but was worth the wait.
"October 13, 2006","It was the first famous landmark I visited on my first trip to London in March this year. It was a miserable, cold day and I missed my stop.  The big bus people were so friendly. They told me how to get there. I couldn't imagine the different nationalities visiting at the same time. Got to the comfort room first, then a bit of refreshment at Mc.Donald. (However do we survive the hunger and thirst without them?  I joined the queue. It was long. I had to wait for the next intake. The girl at the ticket place gave us some hints so we won't experience the dreaded phobia of heights!I got to sit. Some brave people just stood and looked out. I started chatting with a couple from rural England there on their first visit too. It was the gentleman's 60th birthday present. So his lady and I chatted in between photo taking. As far as wecan see we can behold glorious sights. Excellent view. I would go on it again the next time I visit England.It is a must-see. Forget the long wait to get up there. Just do it.It is worth the wait.Emily RuddSydney, Australia",Loved it!
"August 16, 2006","The British Airways London Eye was truely an amazing experience.  I am a person who is slightly afraid of heights, and I had a great time.  The Eye is very stable and does not shake, so I felt very safe.  The view from the eye was outstanding, and this attraction is a must see in London!",Awesome!!!!

The champagne experience was just what we needed smaller group of people, little glass of champagne and a lovely guide more than happy to take the perfect picture of you with an incredible back drop! 😀 loved every second of the 30 minute journey would highly recommend X",Splurge for Flexi Fast-Track
"January 23, 2020","For the 360 degree, high-above-London view, I recommend everyone ride this at least once.  We pre-bought the Fast Track ticket before we knew that it would be raining at our chosen time, so the weather hindered our view slightly.  However, even in the rain, there's something peaceful about being that high above millions of people in your little bubble.  I can imagine it wouldn't be so peaceful if your pod companions are chatty and loud, but we had a quiet, reverential group.  Still, I recommend trying to ride on a clear day, for how much further you would be able to see under better conditions.  Spring for the Flexi Fast-Track ticket, which lets you ride at whatever time you wish on your chosen day.  This won't help you so much if it's raining from sun up to sun down, but should there be a break in the clouds, you can head pop on over at any time.  But keep in mind that this is an online exclusive on the London Eye website, so don't show up and expect to be able to buy these flexible tickets at the gate.  Also available for purchase online (I'm not sure if you can buy these at the counter too) -- mini binoculars, which you can then keep as a souvenir!",A Must do While in London!

"January 7, 2020","My wife and I took our 16 year old granddaughter to London.  While there, we took her on the combination river cruise and London Eye.  It was something that would not have made the ""to do"" list absent a request from our granddaughter.  I was concerned that the tours would present opportunities to stand in long lines to do activities with little payoff.  We enjoyed the river tour and found the guide to be energetic and entertaining.  The Eye does provide quite a view, even on a rainy day.  The lines at both events were well managed and efficient.",Excellent venue

"December 16, 2019",I was surprised by the size of the london eye  it was very big which told me that there would be an amazing view as i went on i noticed there was a huge amount of space. it was the weekend and even with all the people there was still a lot of space for every one to move around. in my opinion I would say it’s great for explorers and social media influencers,"Awesome, must do"
"December 13, 2019","We were unsure as it wasn't cheap and seemed a bit touristy, but absolutely worth it! Such an amazing view of all of London, and night or day are both amazing.

Madame Tussaud's, longer queues, time slot not really on time, pretty crowded. A little disappointed that none of the royal family could be photographed self, photos ridiculously expensive.

"May 30, 2019","Excellent thing to do, great view, of course! Been here a couple of times, and normally no need to bit fast track, probably good during summer vacations ",River Cruise Fantastic! London Eye horrendous experience that I never want to repeat!
"May 29, 2019","On Monday my husband, 4 children and I participated in the double package of a river cruise and a trip on the london eye. The river cruise was fantastic. Nala, our guide, was funny, friendly and very informative. We loved it! We then were helped by some lovely staff who advised us to come back to the queue for the eye as we were a little early. A short stop for some chips and everything was going well. We rejoined the queue which was quick and efficient. Everything went downhill from there though. When we reached the front we were asked how many were in our party - 6 - at which point the female member of staff turned to the lady next to us and repeated the same question. We were led onto the pod and that was the end of our fun. The lady next to us was part of a large and very rowdy family group. They blocked all of the windows so we could not see anything. They were extremely loud - shouting, singing and jumping around the pod. They climbed on the handrails to take selfies and lay on the bench in the centre so us and another family were forced to the back with nowhere to go and nothing to see. When we did try to get to a window they physically pushed us (including our young children) out of the way. When I asked them if we could get in to get a photo of the children they just looked at us and spread out even further. My 9 year old son was nervous before the flight began but this large group just made his anxiety even worse resulting in him breaking down in tears asking to be let off the london eye. He was simply terrified at the behaviour of this large group of adults and teenagers when he was already nervous at being so high. At one point I almost stood on their baby because she was allowed to just crawl around the floor of the pod while they climbed on the railings. It was disgraceful behaviour that totally ruined the experience for me and my family. When we mentioned this to the salesperson on the photo desk he did apologise and said that the group should have been split up. The opposite happened though and they were actively encouraged by your staff to remain together. If they had wanted a private pod they should have paid for one instead of ruining the experience for us and another family who were trapped with them for the full horrendous experience. It was extremely intimidating and the opposite of what I would expect from a family attraction. As a family of 6 this was an expensive excursion for us but we thought that it would have been a worthwhile experience for our young children. Instead it has become an experience in how to deal with other peoples bad behaviour and lack of respect for others and an experience that none of us wish to repeat. I certainly will not be recommending it to family and friends.",Coca Cola London Eye
"May 26, 2019","Was part of a Golden Tours package. Kids age 6 and 13. Tuesday evening line was about a 20 minute wait. Capsule/pod held about 20ish people. Seating for maybe 8 on a bench in the middle. Others stand around the edge so if you want to see, you stand. We all enjoyed the views. Fish and chips food truck just down the river path is worth the short walk!",Ok - but overpriced
"May 26, 2019","To start with a positive, the views from the top of the London eye are pretty fantastic, and on a hot sunny day, the air-conditioned cabin is quite pleasant.However, a 30 minute wait for a 20 minute ride is disproportionate, and this after having an advanced ticket purchased.Also, get ready for thousands of people, stressed employees, and an attempt to get as much money out of you via photo opportunities and selling overpriced slushees.Finally, even with a combo ticket, this is a pretty expensive Ferris wheel ride.The day before, we had a view from the top of Saint Pauls Cathedral, which is equally stunning, but this coupled with a historic building, and an exciting (500? Steps) walk up the stairway to the top of the dome.You don’t have to be athletic to walk up Saint Pauls Cathedral, and it is a much, much better value for your money. Skip the London Eye.",Good not Great
"May 25, 2019","Did this on my last day. I purchased the fast pass but the standard line seemed to take about the same amount of time. It was a clear day and the views were great, but in reality you just see the same things as you do at ground level (Westminster, buildings in the city, etc.). ",How can you not do this?
"May 24, 2019","A must-do in London. The queu was very long, but the system works well and the crowd moved quickly. The view is unparalleled of course and though expensive well worth it. ",Very fun thing to do while in London!
"May 17, 2019","This was a very fun experience, large cars that could fit 20 people, but we only had 10-12 in ours.  Rotates very slowly so you can see all the views, which are magnificent!  You can get a book with pictures of your party for a small fee, which is fun.  Also don't forget to go to the 3-D experience across the walk from the London Eye, it's very fun and included in the ticket, this is where you can get the picture book.  Really enjoyed it!  One of our party gets motion sickness and this did not bother her at all.",Nice to visit

"July 3, 2019","Last Sunday we visited the London Eye while on holiday in London having purchased our ticket over the internet. The directions over the net were somewhat vague so we expected instructions and directions when we arrived. We expected either verbal instructions about where to line up or some clear signs. As there were lots of people in the line up we could Not see the sign posts as they were only about 1 metre high. There was also not enough staff to provide instructions. In frustration we went and lined up for 20 minutes at the ticket office who said we should have just lined up in the correct past track queue. Eventually we found the queue and after another 30 minutes got into a capsule.The trip itself was okay but lacked instruction as to what we were looking at. There wasn’t any points of interest, compass for direction or any handouts to improve the quality of the experience.Unfortunately for us as our capsule reached the top we must have had a mechanical breakdown which left us at the top for a considerable time. Only once out of the 35 minutes were we told of the breakdown and were NOT told of the progress of repairs. This should have been communicated when the air conditioning was turned off for about 15 minutes.Eventually, the rotation began and after about 15 minutes we disembarked from the Eye. I did NOT understand why one of our fellow passengers with a badly broken leg in a wheel chair was allowed to be removed while rotating, when we had to stop the rotation to ‘load’ her. Didn’t seem right!Finally after our experience, there wasn’t a “sorry for your inconvenience’ , it was down the stairs, here’s a bottle of water. There wasn’t a “sorry, but please come back again’ there wasn’t a thing. We did have a poor experience and were unlucky but the lack of communication and poor attitude seems to systematic in London. There are plenty of alternative experiences in London for the same amount of money.Recommendations 1. Make the signs of queues high enough to see when there’s a crowd.2. Improve the directions foe queues on the website.3. Have some sort of guide either verbally, paper or electronic on each capsule know what we are looking at.4. If it breakdown communicate to the patrons regularly5. If apologising for a breakdown at least do it will some sincerity.I doubt we will be back, but it hard to recommend this experience to anyone else who will be visiting London",Over priced 
"July 2, 2019",Not what it used to be......if it’s busy you’ll pay through the nose for a fast pass.....if not prepare to wait for a crowded capsule. ,Overpriced ferris wheel ride
"June 27, 2019","This has become an iconic London attraction but it’s overhyped and overpriced in my opinion. Our tour guide told us that originally it was supposed to be there for few months only, but been there for years due to the huge amount of money it is making- up to 250,000 BP per day!  The commercial focus of this attraction became clear to us when we tried to buy its tickets. There were 6 of us including 2 small children and 2 students. We were shocked to hear the tickets were over  $200. There were no discounts for the children nor for the students in the group. Having been on the Orlando Eye, we didn’t think this ride is worth its fee and skipped it. The lines were long, so if it’s worth it to you, get your tickets online to save your time. ",Great way to see the city 
"June 25, 2019","London eye is one of the must do things to do in London. Situated near the Thames , eye offers you great views of the city . Do go for 2 for 1 offers with national rail tickets . It's a great bargain. ",Get there at the right time
"June 24, 2019","My wife and daughter loved London Eye and we found that the key is getting there at the right time for admission.  We tried on a Friday evening and the line was simply too long.  We asked one of the attendants when would be the best time to return and she suggested before noon any weekday.  We bought online tickets and arrived at 1115 AM and the line was perhaps five minutes.  They both loved the experience, got some great photos and had no regrets.  Neither found it scary at all.",AMAZING VIEWS! 
"June 22, 2019","This is definitely something to do when in London. We had VIP tickets, which we booked when arriving at the London Eye. The VIP tickets allowed us to enjoy a drink in the London Eye Lounge. Then we were welcomed by our guides from the lounge. We got in our compartment with other visitors and got some amazing views. This is a must do!! ",360 View of London 
"June 19, 2019",I purchased likely the latest possible purchase of a fast pass (and pass to get on as it was almost closed for the evening) - I didn’t really check the line out first and I likely could have saved the 10 pounds as there was no line anyway (no one said anything to me either) Views were good on a cloudy gloomy day (sadly Big Ben is completely covered in scaffolding right now) but you could see Houses of Parliament and several iconic London buildings You can walk around and take some cool shots You also get a picture (likely with other people in it) of your trip around the wheel to purchase Definitely something to check out if you have the time on your trip just to say you’ve done it ,Seriously save you ££
"June 9, 2019","I can think of so many better ways I could have spent  ££. Crowded, dirty pods, and windows need a cleaning. If you’re strapped for things to do, go ahead but a true tourist trap. ",Unusual way to see London!
"June 6, 2019","The views are wonderful!  One rotation takes a half-hour (non-stop, by the way), so there's plenty of time for photos & just enjoying the views.",Great trip for travelling with kids
"April 9, 2023",My son and I really enjoyed the cruise despite him not wanting to take a boat ride. By chance we met Dennis from the on board retail concession and he advised us of the best seats for the best pictures. He was true to his word. On board commentary was good fun and interesting. Would definitely do again and highly recommend.,Nice experience with very good view of Big Ben and Palace of Westminster
"April 9, 2023","Long queue to enter, pre-booking of time slow is necessary. Nice ride of about 30 minutes, very good spot to take pictures with you and Big Ben / Palace of Westminster in the background.",Disappointing and overpriced
"April 9, 2023","Very expensive for being herded around and spoken to like cattle.  We had prebooked tickets online, which was straightforward.  The time on the ticket is the time you get into the official queue, but we also had to join an unofficial queue for the queue itself!  Lots of queueing and were then shouted at by a security guard, when we asked if we were in the right place.  It's quite confusing as the queue straggles around and there is no signage to tell you where to go, so during Easter holidays it resembled a rugby scrum.When we finally got on board, we were shoved into a pod with loads of people, so not not really enough space for everyone to look out of the glass.  As a previous poster had said, the skyline map which used to identify the various landmarks has been removed, so it's not easy to know what you're looking at.  I wouldn't bother again, there are other places in London that afford a good view of the city for far less money and in greater comfort.",Great experience
"April 9, 2023","Really helpful staff and great to be able to access in my wheelchair. We were told about the photo that gets taken on the capsule because we asked about the photo package we had purchased in advance. However if we hadn’t been told, we wouldn’t have been aware that a pictures gets taken on board, it would have been a shame to miss it. Photo package is great, definitely recommend purchasing. But it’s a real rush at the end to get the photos, because it’s in a small area and very crowded, so was difficult to access in my wheelchair with my young son. ",Excellent
"April 9, 2023","My boy and I went on the london eye yesterday and he loved it. I’ve been on about 5 times and it never disappoints (but a nice, clear day does help!!). The queue takes about 45 minutes and the ride itself is about the same. I highly recommend this to anyone visiting london. 👍",Amazing views
"April 9, 2023","Went on the eye as part of a multi ticket for a family four. It's very expensive without a deal. We had the first ride of the day at 10am. We got in the queue 9.40am and was on the ride at 10.05am. This was Saturday 8th April. As the queues were not massively busy they didn't over fill the pod with people and we had plenty of room to move around all of the pod to see views from every angle. The weather was beautiful which helps, we had clear sky's and sunshine so got to see wonderful views of london. The pod did get quite hot as the sun was shining. It moves slowly and our ride lasted around 25 minutes. It was a great experience.",Definitely worth it
"April 8, 2023","Very enjoyable experience. Would definitely do it again.  Blessed with a lovely clear sunny day, which added to it. ",Ivan Van Der Westhuzien - employee of the year
"April 8, 2023",Birthday treat to the London Eye today. Had a standard ticket and whilst waiting in the queue the fabulous Ivan Van Der Westhuzien greeted us took us to the fast track queue! He was vibrant and we really enjoyed chatting with him.,Another Ferris wheel
"April 8, 2023",Let's admitIt's a glorified Ferris wheel.Nothing all that special. We did have a nice view as it was a very sunny day.It was another box to tick..,"Easy, smooth ride 😎"
"April 8, 2023","Walked by and saw no line so we got tix and hopped on. Wonderful. Half hour ride gives you the best view of town, Parliament and Big Ben.  We do this every time we go to London. A Must Do for visitors.",there are better things to do
"May 9, 2019","I believe that the best thing about London Eye is looking at it from the distance, it adds some kind of personality to the skyline. The experience itself is very boring. It’s fair to say that London doesn’t have the most interesting skyline to see from the above and at the time of my visit, the Parliament and Big Ben were under renovation so the best part of the view wasn’t looking so great. Keep in mind that is always busy and it takes a while to get into the ride so I strongly recommend the fast track ticket. The area around is also full of tourists so mind your little ones and your safety. Make sure you take your time to walk on south bank, that’s a very amazing part of the city, you can find a stair and go to Tamis’ beach, there’s nice shops, great food and nice view. You can walk to Tate Modern or, even better, to London Tower ",nice view
"May 5, 2019","I had a lovely time at London Eye, the view is amazing and took great pictures. It takes around 20 minutes and you don't see it, time flights ",Great
"May 3, 2019","Great esperience , loro of people but i can said that it worth! Book the tiket online is definely better!",Like visiting a doctor. You are paying to be poked by a needle
"April 24, 2019","OK so i was not enthusiastic, like my little daughters. This is more of a symbol of london, so there's definitely an emotional value of it. But being a sensible adult, the ride must enthrall me, specially if i spent 38gbp to buy skip the line ticket.+ves:+ Skip the line ticket takes you to the ride in 10 min. The other one, be ready to wait for atleast 60min or more+ Screenshot of your ticket, can be easily scanned near the entrance.+ Staff was fast efficient and taking care of our needs+ Cleanliness is well maintained+ Vending machines have been installed, if you forgot water or drinks+ Safety sense was very much there. Staff guides you on how to enter and exit the capsule-ves- Total rip off. You take one full revolution. Very slowly. In the afternoon, it gets quite hot in there and we were standing under the AC ducts.- There was no audio commentary, to guide you on important things in the viccinity. This could've reduced our boredom a bit.- All excitement vanishes after 3 minutes, since remaining 17 minutes, will be the same bldgs at different elevation.- I thought only i'm being bored. But then my daughters started to fight amongst themselves. Hinting, that they might have lost interest as well :)- NOT VALUE FOR MONEY- Will never return, even if given a free ticketHit LIKE if my review helped you in planning your trip any better.",There are so many other options
"April 21, 2019","Back in 2000 it was unique & it still provides a focus for New Year fireworks but there are so many more (better) options in London now.I would go to the Wally talkie tower, you have to book (but it’s free) & view is way better, & if you get a foggy London sunrise nothing beats itThen there is the cable car which is cheaper & a novelty + gives you more of an E London perspective but also nice to get the view of the city looking across the Docklands Then you have the shard (expensive) or the gherkin (I think you have to have restaurant reservations) but both good viewsWith all the towers going up there are bound to be more options & look out for the tulip tower going up next years",Around we go ... oh wait no we don’t
"April 19, 2019","Was very busy but worth the wait, we did get stuck for a few minutes right up the top but that served us well as we could take more panoramic photos from the very top! Get there early to get your ticket, also try and eat before hand if you can very expensive to eat around the eye!",Great Views
"April 18, 2019","We purchased tickets from Trip Advisor in advance for this (skip the line tickets), and it was totally worth it. We were able to bypass the long line, which probably saved us an hour or two. It was SUPER crowded on Saturday when we were there, perhaps try another day. There are free restrooms inside the building where you can purchase tickets (downstairs). Even though the Eye doesn't stop when you're getting on, it does move very very slowly, so it's easy enough to get on/off. If you have a fear of heights, like me, there are seats in the middle, so you can look out without getting as anxious. ",Beautiful but pricey
"April 16, 2019",Spring break 2019 with 3 teens. This was one of the attractions the kids insisted on doing. While the views are stunning I felt that the cost was on the expensive side. We went at dusk which I thought was perfect because all the city lights started to turn on as we were getting close to the top.  The ride is very smooth. You can barely feel any movement. We bought our tickets as an add-on with Big Bus Tours. That included a river cruise and Tower of London. But you have to get the vouchers from a Big Bus attendant.  So that was a bit of a hassle because there was no one available in the immediate vicinity of the London Eye. So I guess what I'm suggesting just buy the tickets at the London Eye ticket office. It wasn't worth the $10 I saved frantically searching for a Big Bus attendant,Nice view for half an hour ride
"April 14, 2019","Remember to book your ticket online for fast track, and for flexible timing, it is costly but only if you dont need to queue to go up to enjoy the nice view. I would recommend to do the walk by the river afterwards.",Crowded but good
"April 7, 2019",The London Eye was amazing. We went on a clear day and were able to see a lot of London from a birds eye view.,"Rude staff, Long Wet Queues"
"January 9, 2017","I had prepaid my ticket and only needed to pick it up.The doors were shut and it was raining with no where to shelter.The door sign said open at 11. My booking was for 11 so I needed my tickets before that.I tried to attract the attention of a person inside to get information and he kept telling me to go away. Great customer service.When it was time to open (10.30 as it turned out. The sign on the door was wrong), they could not unlock the doors.When we got inside I had 7 people in front of me and there were 3 people issuing tickets.It took 20 minutes to get my ticket. This is true!By the time I got to the ride there was a huge queue in front of me and guess what.It was in the rain. No rain protection at all.Even more galling is that despite waiting your turn in the queue for up to an hour (in the rain!), anyone who has lots of money can pay an extra 10 pounds and walk straight past you to the top of the queue.The view from the ride was not clear with the rain covering the plastic sides.It gets better.Half way up it broke down.We didnt know what was going on because the speaker was not working properly.There were multiple calls saying we have fixed the problem and your ride has continued. While we stayed immobile.As it rains a lot in London, I would recommend against this attraction unless you love being treated like second class people and have a fetish for standing for hours in the rain.Go to the Shard.Its higher, its indoors and they let you return free of charge if the weather is bad on your visit.As fair as the Coca Cola Eye is concerned. I dont know where you learned your customer skills from but go back to school.You dont get a good reputation by treating your customers like you do.","Boring, skip it."
"March 22, 2017","If you like super slow ferris wheels, this is the attraction for you.  However, the eye would have been better if the thing went faster to  decrease the boredom factor. Also, if I had gotten into a car with no one else, I think the experience would have been much better. The idiots who spent the entire time taking selfies and photos of each other, admiring the ""wonderful pic"" and then discussing in very loud voices their photo masterpiece qualities, made me mental.",Overpriced and overestimated
"March 9, 2017","Please do not get me wrong the view from there is really magnificent. But there are a couple cheaper (even free) alternatives like the roof garden on the ""Walkie-Talkie Tower"" . The area around there is quite nice so you might want to visit and decide there if it is worth its price.",A little boring 
"March 9, 2017",Visited today with my daughters aged 12 and 9 we are Merlin pass holders. We arrived at 11 and queued for 35 minutes staff were polite and friendly the actual experience itself was ok but nothing special. I'm glad we have experienced the London Eye but won't be going in on it again. ,Amazing views. Go later in the afternoon for reduced queues.
"March 4, 2017","We visited this on a Monday, about 4pm, which meant no queues, after quickly paying for tickets, we were on in 5 minutes.  We used our tickets from Southern Rail train from Gatwick to give us a 2 for 1 offer. It would have been very dear if we hadn't had this. Views great, little bit scary as we went near the top, but you forget that. Don't forget to do the 4D cinema experience, it's short but fun.","Fun Experience, but not a must see"
"March 4, 2017","I'm happy that I was convinced to ride the London Eye. The view is spectacular, but if you're pressed for time or on a tighter budget, this is an activity you can definitely skip. If you are planning to ride the London Eye, it's well worth it to spend the extra money for a fast pass ticket, it will cut your wait time down significantly. Since the ride on the eye is only ~30mins, without a fast pass ticket it's very likely that you'll end up waiting in line for way longer than the ride on the Eye lasts.",Converted!
"March 3, 2017","I was very sceptical about going on the London Eye as I thought it was too expensive and a waste of time, however I got 2 for 1 tickets from National Rail by using my train tickets to London and it was great. It is very clean (cleaners come on after every rotation to clean the pod in seconds) and very interesting. The touchscreens are great so you can see what particular buildings are (or to look for any that are not obvious straight away). We only queued for about 10 minutes as they get people on and off the pods quite quickly. Loved it, one of the highlights of the trip!",Book in advance and check the weather! Avoid champagne experience
"March 2, 2017",A great experience as we expected but the weather changed and it got very wet and foggy so we were restricted. Definitely pay for the fast track even though you end up queueing here also. Do not bother with the champagne experience the lounge is dirty and cold with booming music - the steps up were sticky from not being cleaned. You will get wet queueing if the weather is bad so definitely wrap up. Staff there seem not to care almost numb - their pay must be low. It gets very busy around the London eye so expect people everywhere. We were hungry before we went up so we found a subway around the corner for a cheap sandwich - directly on the street behind the eye,Not to bad
"January 2, 2017",Go on a clear day... and avoid school holiday the ques can be quite large prebook you tickets online if you can,Great views of Big Ben
"October 12, 2016","The views from the top are awesome! Especially the houses of the parliament! I prefer it at night time, but it's also gorgeous on a sunny day. Must try! ",Great experience
"September 28, 2016",We were lucky we had a lovely sunny day. Definitely an experience not to miss.  The views were amazing.,Meh
"September 19, 2016","Overpriced and overcrowded - supposedly the pods hold 25 people,  but in ours there were no less than 30,  with many (screaming) kids. ",Queues ridiculous and allocated time meaningless
"September 3, 2016","I had planned to take a friend on the Eye who had never visited the capital before, as a treat. I booked and paid for the tickets 2 weeks in advance for a 3pm 'flight' When we arrived, we queued for 50mins just to collect the tickets and were then told that there was at least another 45 mins in a second queue to actually get on The Eye due to 'lots of school parties'. That would mean our 3pm tickets would actually be for nearer 5pm, the time we had booked and paid to have dinner. We were told casually that we could use the tickets any time up until 9pm as if it was ok to hang around for 6 hours for something we had booked for a specific time. I was told that tickets were non refundable and that was a blanket policy. Well, sorry, but you broke the contract to provide a service and, in law, that means you have to provide a refund regardless of whatever policies you wish to try to impose. A thoroughly shameless and illegal practice engaged by a company that ought to know better. Fortunately, I got a full refund from my credit card company despite you trying to defend your indefensible and shoddy practices.It's a shame because the London Eye used to be good until this lot started to run the show and became so draconian.","Brilliant, what an experience"
"August 12, 2016",Pre book your tickets to avoid the queues. What an experience this is! Spectacular views and very much worth doing. ,Nothing amazing apart from it's actual construction
"August 10, 2016","I feel let down by the London Eye. It was very hyped up when it was first around, but once on it I felt it was nothing special in terms of an exciting ride. It turns very slowly. Yes, there are good views of The Houses of Parliament and Big Ben from above, but you can see these from the ground and be amazed. I admit the Eye is an architectural feat, but for me it's a bit boring.",Disorganised chaos
"February 26, 2017","Far to many tickets being sold, not enough staff, 2 plus hours in a queue to collect tickets then another 90 mins to get on the ride.  Very expensive and boat ride was a total rip off. ",Disappointed
"February 13, 2017","Queued for 30mins to buy tickets, to be told we didn't have return train tickets, only outward journey (as we're buying with 241) so manager forced us to return to hotel for train tickets. Very poor customer service, as he could see we'd arrived by train (how were we going to get home!?) Had to queue again, manager couldn't even look at my husband on our return, and wouldn't let us purchase fast pass to get an allocated time. Again, terrible customer service.30 min queue on return before ride. Actual ride took 30 mins, no commetary available. It was the worst attraction we visited in London, would NOT recommend.",Must see
"January 28, 2017",This is London's must see! View is just spectacular worth it's queue and price so just don't think twice  and g,Long queues - even though pre booked
"August 10, 2016",Really disappointed with this experience. We pre booked tickets (which are not cheap) and arrived in plenty of time. Joined queue and stood for 50 minutes in hot weather before getting onto pod. I felt really sorry for people with young kids. AV TVs did not work and the staff we encountered were rude and dismissive. Lovely view of London of course but would advise visitors just to pop into the Tate Modern for free viewing in much more pleasant surroundings. Save your money folks - the eye is a rip off in our experience. Pity. ,Great views but long queues 
"August 6, 2016","Had a great time on the London eye with great views, it was a shame the queues were so long, had to wait over and hour to get on the attraction. ",Amazing
"September 8, 2015","Get on the London Eye to get a 360 degree birds eye view of the city of London. Sit in the glass capsules as you see the Thames bending for miles and capturing the other attractions of the city like Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Tower Bridge, Gherkin Building et.al. Queues can be long during weekends. You can book your tickets online and be in the pick up queue which is relatively smaller and faster than the queue for buying tickets. You can also get into the Fastrack queue which will save you a lot of time including avoiding the long queue of embarking, but that comes at almost double the price of normal tickets",One of our favorites
"August 28, 2015","Beautiful views, smooth ride even for those with fear of heights,  expensive but worth the money.  Get the fast pass!",Fun thing to do with family and friends 
"August 15, 2015","The lines are huge, even though you have a ticket for a certain time. We made the mistake of waiting to go on our last day, which was Saturday, and we showed up with vouchers at 6pm. The first tickets were available for 8:30pm. We couldn't line up before 8:00pm, and even then we probably waited for 45 minutes. Inside the capsule, you have nice views, but it's basically 40 minutes of people taking selfies! I'm glad we did it, but at the same too, I'm not sure if I'd do again if i came back to London. ",Fantastic view
"August 15, 2015","We ride this every time we visit London and are always amazed with the view and how many people ride this every day.This is right across from Big Ben and Parliament so the view is truly one of a kind. I would recommend getting your ticket ahead of time via the internet. First of all it is less expensive. Second you can avoid the line to buy tickets. The nearest station is either Westminster or Waterloo. I like the former because of the view along the river. I would also recommend getting the daytime/night time ticket. we rode it at 10 AM and then you can ride it again anytime after 5 PM. We went back around 9 PM and the lights of London just reemphasize what a beautiful city it is. Also when you get into the pod, I would avoid sitting. Everyone heads for the benches but really you are not there to sit. Head to the end of the pod facing the left side. That way you can guarantee the best view during the 30 minute ride. ",Champagne Experience on the Eye
"August 14, 2015","Advice: book the ""Champagne Experience"" for the London Eye and have a way, way better experience than those who are waiting in that interminable line with their standard tickets.  If you book online in advance it's £28.80.  The extra eight pounds are absolutely worth it.  The area around the Eye is a tad sketchy and super touristy, as is to be expected.  When we approached, I saw the world's longest line stretching out from the Eye and felt a little glum... but my friend had booked Champagne Experience tickets, so we strolled right past that horrible line and picked up tickets at a nearby building.  Then, we were pointed to a lounge on the second floor, where we waited around a little bit (but on comfortable sofas with views of the Eye, so much better than that line outside), and were then taken directly to the Eye by a private guide with the other parties who'd booked our time slot.  We went through security quickly, where our bags were checked, and then straight onto the Eye with no waiting.  There were about 12 of us total in the group, which was a perfect size.  We had plenty of room to move about the car and not feel crowded.  Our guide poured a glass of Champagne for each of us, handed out maps of what we'd see on our ride, and then gave some description of what we were seeing and engaged us in a quick trivia contest that got everyone laughing.  Everyone was enjoying themselves.  The views from the Eye are spectacular.   My only complaint is that I'd have liked to go around again, it was so breathtaking.  We were there towards the end of the day, on a gorgeous, clear day, and the views of London were absolutely incredible.  I'm afraid of heights, but had no trouble with the Eye.  It moves slowly and the cars are very sturdy, so you don't feel the up & down movement.  If you're going to do the Eye, I recommend bypassing those crowds so you can really enjoy the experience.  Upgrade that ticket!  This is one of those places it's worth it to spend a bit more, if you can.",Amazing view!!
"August 12, 2015","It's a fun attraction in london. There is a beautiful view of the city you can see the big ben, the castles and a pretty part of the london.I recommend!!!! Go guys!!!",Good views
"August 8, 2015","One of the most popular places in London, this place attracts loads of tourists as there is lots more to do than just taking a ride on the big wheel. The views are good from top both on good clear day or night, but there is actually much more happening in and around the eye on the quay side. just spare enough time if you plan to take a ride on this as there is a long q's....",Iconic
"July 31, 2015","This was the first thing we did when we arrived in London. I already bought tickets online prior to arriving to London. We got our Fast Track tickets which were amazing. We saw the queue to buy tickets and we are glad that bought out tickets online. We got there a bit early and the ticket we bought was for 5:00pm but they allowed us to go up around 4:30pm. We met up with out relatives who got normal tickets online, but they were allowed to upgrade their tickets to Fast track tickets. The queue for the normal ticket is different from the fast track tickets. The fast track ticket queue was empty. The capsule was big enough for a few people. You have to sort of squeeze yourself at times to see the view or to take photos as some people hog an area of the capsule. You just have to be polite. The views were amazing, especially because it was my first time in London. We were lucky that it was an amazing day, just a little bit of cloud in the sky. The ride felt quite quick which I'm not complaining about. It just feels so surreal to be in the London eye. The souvenir shop had a lot of good stuff. The 4D experience was pretty cool too. There were also some ice cream stands and drink stands around the area. There was also a cafeteria closeby if you get hungry and toilets of course. Simply amazing.",Excellent views of London from the London Eye
"July 27, 2015","Excellent panoramic views from the London Eye. The London cityscape is fantastic!The 30 minute revolution is about the right amount of time to enjoy the scenery and take pictures.Definitely recommend spending extra and buying the ""Fast Track"" option. My family was able to avoid the regular line-ups of +1 hour (perhaps even 2 hours?), as the timing of our visit coincided with the first Saturday after school let out in July.Sheer madness and chaos in and around the County Hall building, I think especially on the weekends. Purchase your tickets on-line in advance and save. The line-ups to retrieve your pre-purchased tickets are shorter than the line-ups to buy tickets (and no guarantee that tickets will be available).Either way, bring your patience ... and enjoy!",Fantastic experience
"July 26, 2015","We visited London last weekend and went on the eye on the Sunday. We arrived just after opening (as advised) and queued for about 20-25min. The queue moved constantly so it didn't feel like we were waiting for long.We had a BOGOF offer from national rail card, which was great, as it can get expensive if you are a family paying full price, so look out for offers.Myself and my 7 year old daughter rode the eye and we both really enjoyed the experience. We paid £1 extra for the souvenir map, which in my opinion was well worth it as, we spotted sights such as Wembley stadium, which we probably would not have noticed without the map.  It was surreal to be viewing busy noisy London in a relatively quiet and peaceful ""bubble"" and the views were amazing!!!!!Included in the ticket is a 4D show, which was a nice extra and worth doing, although I think I have been spoilt by visiting the Florida theme parksI think this is attraction is defiantly worth a visit if you are in London, it's an experience myself and my daughter certainly won't forget.",Disappointed 
"August 4, 2016",Annoying waiting to get in and once in its full of people and takes ages to go around. The view from the Shard is much better and you if you can go there it's much more interesting as well...,London Eye (in the rain) and Still Worth the Visit
"June 25, 2016","Yes, a bit pricey, but it's London and worth the price for the range of breathtaking views around the city and of the Thames. It moves slowly, so much so that there are times you think you may have stopped (and at one point it did for loading passenger(s) with disabilities). The only negative was the long line to buy tix. Too many options/up sell opportunities, so it's slow. Not sure you can purchase in advance, but if so, go for it!Note that we visited on a typically rainy/cloudy evening and except for the windows of our pod being wet and reducing photo quality, we thought it was OK to do this in the rain.","""I See London, I See France . . . """
"March 12, 2016","The London Eye provides excellent views of the city, but be sure to time your visit accordingly so that you're not shooting photos into the mid afternoon sun.",Great day
"January 13, 2016",Had a great day in London for my husbands 40th river boat cruise  and dinner then onto London eye brilliant views of our great city,Good for First Time Visitors
"December 22, 2015",The London Eye has become a tourist icon.  The views on a clear day make the 30 minute voyage a worthwhile excursion.  The lines are typically long and the Coca Cola Company sponsored attraction tickets are pricey.  Recommended for first time visitors to London with an interest in taking landmark and city view photos.  A walk across the Jubilee Bridge en-route to or from the Eye is a worthwhile undertaking.,Nice as always. 
"December 20, 2015","The queue was lovely and quick considering it was a Friday near Christmas, so we got on in less than 10 minutes. The journey round was smooth and seamless, offering panoramic views of the London skyline. The pod is lovely and cool, the glass clean and adequate seating for everyone who doesn't want to stand. ",a must do thing !
"December 15, 2015","unique fantastic experience. We did it around 5PM, when the City lights are starting to come up. We went for the flexible fasttrack, a bit more expensive but great choice, almost w/o queue.",Must do thing !!!!
"December 12, 2015",Not to many words to waste. Buy a ticket and do it (spend an extra couple of bucks do the champagne or cocktail experience) skip the lines and enjoy 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼,Great views!
"December 3, 2015","This is worth doing once, especially if there isn't a hideous line. You don't need to go the ""fast track"" gazebo to purchase your ticket - UNLESS - there is a huge line and you are in a hurry. You can purchase the less expensive tickets inside the building outside of the London Eye. It's enjoyable and a great place to take photos.",Amazing view
"November 25, 2015","Best view you can get, friendly staff and when we arrived monday evening there was NO que at all! Strongly recommended. ",A must do!!
"November 18, 2015","If you go to London you have to go on the eye. I was a little apprehensive as i am not good with heights, however, I am so glad i did.It is worth the money for the sights.I went on just as it started to get dark, by the time we got to the top it was dark and the whole of London was lit up. An amazing sight.And to make it even better there was the 4d experience built into the price, which we visited afterwards. Its only about 5 minutes long but really ended a fantastic experience.","Try it at dawn, day, dusk and night for a different experience"
"November 8, 2015","Been on it a few times now, at various times of the day, and each time it is great and suprising. It is always nicer to to on with friends, new to London, and point out landmarks.",Amazing
"November 1, 2015","This attraction in london is in my top 3Its amazing, yes there are long queues and the wait is long but believe me its worth itThe views at the top are fantastic, the staff were very helpful and always smileyJust a shame it closes on 31st Oct as would love to see the Christmas Lights of London from the top and maybe next time ill hire a capsule with champagne :)",Absolutely awfyl
"October 19, 2015","We paid for the tickets and then we weren't allowed in.  Absolutely terrible will never come back, totally outrageous confiscation of merlin passes 😡😡😡😡",Fun but expensive.
"October 14, 2015","I really like the London eye. If your in London for a short time it's a must do, the view or the Houses of Parliament & Big Ben are great. But be warned it isn't cheap! They try to make it seem value for money by showing a 4D film before you going the line. It's probably good for small kids but I got a little bored and impatient just wanting to get on the eye. All in all you have to do it even tho it's expensive. But so are most tourist things and they all have their own draw.",On Top Of The London Eye!
"October 11, 2015","Once you’ve enjoyed London from the ground level, it’s a great idea to head upwards and look down on the city’s many famous buildings and attractions. The views are truly panoramic. I can’t help but admire the beautiful buildings and bridges. Was it worth the ride? Yes it was!",champagne run
"October 6, 2015",this was our second visit to the London Eye and both time we did the champagne run which is more expensive but less crowded and has a shorter queue. It was a beautiful day so we had great views,Great way to get an overall birds eye view perspective of London
"October 4, 2015",Visited with UK relatives who had little experience of London. This was the first thing we did to give them an overall perspective of the city and the main downtown geography. A must see for first time visitors. Booked tickets online the night before and required only a 5min queue to pick up an hardly any wait for the ride.,Great way to see London
"October 1, 2015",The Eye is in a great location which allowed us a birds eye view of some of the great sites in London.,a lovely moment with a beautiful night city view
"September 9, 2015","We enjoyed the night view of London, especially the lighting up Big Ben was very beautiful.  We recommend purchasing the fast pass ticket in advance especially if you visit London during peak season because there was a long line even at around 8PM, which is when we went.",Great view!
"April 13, 2015","Before we went on, we went to the 4D movie which I highly recommend as it was a lot of fun and showed the things you would see from the top. The London eye itself is also great fun and you get your photo taken on it when your on the way down. There are little computers that tell you what each of the buildings are which is handy if your looking for one building in particular. The view from the top is amazing and you can almost see all of London. You definitely can't go to London and not go on the London eye!",Great view
"April 5, 2015",Worth the ride the view is well worth it and there is lots of other stuff to see around the wheel. And just across the brides is big ben,Not Worth the Visit Along With Rude Staff Members!
"April 4, 2015","My husband and I were visiting London from Hong Kong; my husband is originally from New Zealand and this was his first real trip to London I am a British citizen but left the UK 8 years ago. I have always wanted to take a trip on the London Eye and could say it was on my 'bucket list'. We visited the London Eye and bought tickets. We proceed to board and there were 2 security guards checking bags. I opened my bag as it had 3 zip pockets the gentleman checked one pouch but didn't bother with the other 2, he asked me did I have any sharp objects to which I replied no; he waved me on. My husband was dealt with by another member of staff I can only describe this man as an arrogant bully. He was adamant my husband had a bag containing belongings but it was a camera bag which was empty as the camera was around his neck we explained this and showed him inside the bag along with the camera but he continually bullied my husband asking him to stand to one side; when he did he said it was the incorrect place. Maybe if they want customers to stand in a specific place you appoint footprints like they do in all other security areas in the UK. Ironically they had a screening machine maybe they should use rather than treat customers in such an appalling manner. The way my husband was bullied by the member of staff was despicable and it appears there is no consistency in the way you treat people and this tarnished what was supposed to be a special trip. After disembarking we went to find the member of staff to get his security number or a photograph but he was not there. We have visited other iconic buildings i.e. the Statue of Liberty in the USA and were never dealt with like this. I was appalled to be British after treatment like this and I will never visit the London Eye nor recommend it to anybody. Along with the poor treatment we endured before boarding the attraction was very poor value for money, the view was disappointing, the cabin was extremely hot and the experience did not last long. Don't waste your money.",London Eye
"April 3, 2015","Beautiful views of London from here, i went in January for my brothers birthday and we paid to get onto the London eye you get fantastic views from each side. Definitely a attraction to go on. The staff at the London are very welcoming and friendly.",Overprice and awful customer service
"March 26, 2015",went with some visitors from abroad and had to wait over 30 min while we could see a lot of people jumping the queue and if there is a queue it must be followed...one can get to other high venues to see london from above without having to suffer the 45 min queue and overprice fee,Disappointing service 
"March 24, 2015","The view was amazing. You get one full round on the wheel and that's enough, the views on either side are wonderful and even on an overcast day like ours it was outstanding.  The service though of every single worker we came across was horrid. The 3 people taking our tickets out the front were having their own conversation completely,  didnt even look at us or say hello or anything. I now know too much about the fellas domestic with his boss. They were rude, didn't acknowledge anyone coming and going, and a separate group of workers pushed us out of the cabin at the end practically. Disappointing. ",Great ride- go in morning
"March 19, 2015","We happened to get there at 3pm on a Tuesday and there was no line which was great. The cabin holds 35 people so we were excited to have just 2 couples in ours. The views are excellent, but I'd say go in the morning because at 3pm the sun is on the back side of the Parliament/ Big Ben which makes pictures of it almost impossible. They just come out dark, even with our expensive dslr camera. Wish we had thought of that before boarding, because for the price we were not going to ride it again. ",Two words...FAST TRACK
"March 16, 2015","When you get there, if the queue is long, just pony up for the fast pass...we thought it was well worth it! Spectacular views. It moves very, very slow and each compartment is large and air conditioned.Loved it!","Niets aan, veel te duur"
"March 13, 2015","The evening view is good. But it's not -I would like to pay 30 euros PP - good. A definite waste of money if nothing is going on in the city. Yes the views are awesome, but since these views can be admired from inside the shard, it's just a fast diet for your wallet.",Average
"March 13, 2015",Me and my wife went on to the london eye it was a rainy day we sat into the cart and the windows of the cart were realy foggy we could hardly see out. They need to improve on this. It wasent worh the role👎👎,"Short lines so no need for the ""fast pass"" premium ticket."
"June 23, 2015","It is what it is... A large plexiglass bubble that gives amazing views of arguably one of the best cities in the world. Not too crowded, many photo ops since people mill around to take in all angles. We left about an hour before sunset and were luckily treated to dramatic lighting under partly cloudy skies. I highly recommend timing your trip to avoid overcast and/or cloudy conditions. Also a good idea to buy online as the line for tickets looked long but the will-call line was nonexistent and there is a ten percent discount. Take in the short (5 minutes or less) 4D movie before your ride. The line for the ride was less than ten minutes after the movie, so the whole experience was less than an hour (half an hour in the bubble). It is a short, scenic walk across the Thames from the Westminster tube station, or a shorter but less scenic walk from Waterloo Station.",Hotel Chocolat on The Ondon Eye!
"June 19, 2015","On a recent trip to London, I had only 24 hours in the city before taking the Eurostar train to Paris. I Googled 'What to do in London for 6 hours?' The London Eye came up. I had heard about it but never experienced it. Closer attention online yielded that there were two 'Specials' available: a Pommeroy champagne tasting and. Hotel Chocolat with Prosecco experience. We chose the latter which included two rides on the Eye, Priority boarding, and. 3-D movie with Eye highlights all for less than the ticket pric paid 'at the door'! This was a fabulous experience and highly recommended to anyone visiting London. The views, Hotel a Chocolat staff, and Prosecco were a winning combination!",Late review
"June 16, 2015","we hired two capsules early 2000s and had a wedding service during a full rotation. The wedding party in one with priest, and guests linked up by Comms in the second. Outstanding event and has been had to beat. Arguably the best view of central London on a clear day",Customer Service is Terrible - Rip Off
"June 15, 2015","We were very excited about doing the London Eye on our last night in London, but we never got that experience. We booked the 9:00 pm tickets, and that was a mistake. We got on the wrong train, and ended up reaching the attraction at 9:05. We did realize this was after our booked time, but we figured it would be okay after all the reviews we read about how long the lines usually were. And no where in our email did it state that if you book the 9:00 time slot, and you are not there by 9:00 on the dot, you will not be allowed on the attraction. We were extremely frustrated, so we contacted customer service, which by the way is terrible. We were offered the option to rebook for a $10 administration fee, but we could not get our money back. I understand the tickets are non-refundable, but it's not that we didn't show up or just decided to skip it. Unfortunately, we made a tourist mistake, which cost us $91.00! There was no way we could rebook, since we were leaving the next morning, and the chances of coming back in the next year are not great, since we live in the US. I just feel like charging an administration fee is fine or even just refunding half the ticket price, but to keep the full $91.00 for the three of us, for not providing anything, is a rip off. I hope you're enjoying your free money, and we will never support this attraction or its affiliates again. I can't believe Coca-Cola would want it's name associated with this ratchet of an attraction.",What's the point? 
"June 14, 2015","Why spend so much to go on the London Eye when the sky garden is taller, better views, no time limits and it is Free. Don't waste your money,  go to the sky garden and have a meal up there whilst your at it.",NON MILITARY FRIENDLY....Don't expect to much!! Waste of money IMO.
"June 13, 2015","We booked the 3 tickets for the London Eye, Dungeon & Madam Tussauds.I tried to book online through the Military Discount London Eye for 5 days but was not working, when brought to the attention of the staff at L.E collection booth I was met with scouring looks and told nothing was wrong with the website, not even ""we will check it out"" just point blank deal with it!The staff were shocking, did not know what they were doing, could not find my booking & even asked if my name was my name, whatever that means!!We were not even told you need to book you place for the Dungeon so beware and pick your time slot to suit! The L.E itself was OK, nothing fancy but what you personally make of it I guess, however the car infront of us had 10 people in it and the one my wife & I were in had 20 crambed in, again guessing the staff struggle to count.",Go to a The Sky Garden instead!
"June 13, 2015","The London eye was fine, nothing to rave about, the views are impressive but you're sharing a cabin with 20 others so that 'selfie's' a struggle to get!

(20 Fenchurch St, in the Walkie Talkie building) .",Amazing...
"June 9, 2015","London Eye is everything you can imagine. It's a beautiful view to see all . You are better off booking on the internet so you can get a ticket. Its always a long line up, but it does go pretty fast.  And its a nice place to go for a walk and lunch",Poor Management - child bleeding and offered no assistance
"June 5, 2015","I was very upset yesterday after our visit to the Eye.  I decided to wait a day to write my review to determine if I was justified in a low review.  I have thought about this and feel I am.  The Eye itself is a very cool experience.  We purchased fast tract tickets ahead of time and it worked perfectly.  We were on within 10 minutes of arriving.  However, I cannot promote a place that has such little concern for a patron.  While riding the Eye my daughters 10 year old friend began to bleed out of a previous cut.   By the time we exited she had blood on her leg and hand.  The attendant noticed as we got off and told us to go inside to the ticket counter area where we could get to a bathroom to wash off the blood and get tissues for her.  We walked in the door at 8:55pm and was told they closed at 9pm and we could not use the restroom.  I explained that she was bleeding.  This employee told us to go to the bathroom quickly if we could get past ""security.""  A very heavy set employee in a suit would not let us down to the bathrooms, nor would he allow us to get a napkin from the beverage sale area, because, ""the were cleaning up"" and directed us to go two blocks to find a restroom in another business.  Luckily, the employee working the beverage center closest to the door (where they sell Smart Water) saw that she was had blood on her and quickly grabbed some napkins.  The first doorman and the larger ""security"" man laughed as we walked out the door.  As I looked back I noticed the ticket counters were still selling ride tickets to get people on by 9pm.  Was we walked down the waterfront the very nice people working the ice cream stand between the Dungeon and McDonalds saw that she was bleeding and offered water and more napkins.  They even offered bandaids for the First Aid kit, however I had some in my purse to use after getting the cut cleaning up.  I really feel compelled to report a business that has little to no concern to their patrons.  I would highly recommend the Eye experience.  I just hate that ours ended as it did.  Thankfully, a business where we were not patrons were kind enough to help us.",Don't hesitate just do it
"June 4, 2015","After 10 days in London I never gave much thought of doing the London eye. What a mistake, walking pass on our last day around 10 in the morning the line for the eye was only 30 meters long so I thought why not after walking pass over the last week the lines would be hundreds of meters long. The views are breathtaking from the eye you think Big Ben looks great from ground level  wait to you see it from up above. Plenty of room to move around so you will not miss out on photo opportunities. Get there early and beat the crowds and enjoy a life time memory. ",STUNNING VIEWS.
"May 30, 2015","If you are planning on taking a ride on The London Eye,  I suggest you pre book your time & tickets as the queue to this Ride is, in one word,  LONG.

Great to take wonderful photos of all the Landmarks.",How many of these exist?  Go for it!
"May 27, 2015","If you're in London, give it a ride.  We went about dusk and had slight rain, but still got some great photos.  We did the combo package and did the boat ride also which was very interesting.  We are glad we did the combo.",no!  Rip off!
"May 20, 2015","I would love to give this ZERO stars (er...circles).  I booked a ""flexi - fast track"" set of tickets and showed up to a line that snaked out the doors full of irate ""fast"" (or as I like to call it faster slow track) customers waiting for the pleasure of picking up said tickets.  Why you can't simply print out tickets you've already paid for is beyond me.  The line would've taken hours to just pick up paid for tickets.  Then a wait for the actual ride. Mind you this was the Fast Track!The area where it is located was full of tacky ""side show"" type entertainment.  We decide not to waste hours in line - Westminster Abbey took only 40 minutes.  AVOID THIS TACKY Attraction and shoddy customer service. I asked for my money back and they said I could come back later - if like me you have your trip planned out this was not going to happen.  In addition, I was on hold for 15 minutes calling customer service before being cut off - TWICE.  I have been to London four times and there are so many lovely things to do and places to see.  I guess there is a reason I never wasted my money there before (I'm out over $100.00). Do not waste time in this nasty area full of street hucksters.",Worth a visit

"May 17, 2015","I had bought a standard ticket on-line in advance for a ride at 10 am on a Wednesday.  I got there at 9:40 am and a short line was forming already.  The line-up is outdoors so be prepared for the weather.  There were only about a dozen people in the capsule that I had boarded.  You do get a great view during the 30-minute ride.  There are touch-screen Samsung tablets in the capsule that provide useful information on the sights that you see.  There is also a bench in the middle for sitting.Towards the end of the ride, there is a camera that automatically takes a photo of your capsule.  If you stand in the appropriate spot, the photo will include you.  You can buy this photo as part of a souvenir photobook package for £20 in the gift shop.  The photobook contains information about the Eye, a photo spread of London with the prominent sights highlighted, and two photos of you riding the capsule.  You also receive four wallet-size photos, fridge magnet, and a key ring.",Wonderful Views!
"May 9, 2015","We really enjoyed seeing the entire city this way.  Get your tickets in advance and get the fast track tickets.  We had no line and went right to the ride, amazing!",Birds eye view with a glass of bubbly well worth it!
"May 8, 2015",Waited in line to purchase a champagne package on the London Eye and River Cruise. Once we got to the front of the queue we were told to go to the VIP line off to the right as we entered to purchase the champagne ride which leaves every hour on the hour for a limited number of guests. We paid for both the champagne ride and river cruise immediately afterwards (we were cautioned we might not make it). The London eye champagne cruise was well worth the extra cost. We went upstairs to a quiet lounge and waited separately from other patrons and enjoyed a glass of champagne (at an additional cost) prior to being escorted as a separate group to the front of the line and onto our own 'private' pod. The pod was comfortable with 10 people plus our amazing tour guide Rae who served us champagne as we rode around the London Eye and was able to answer all our questions. The 360 degree view was spectacular and we were able to see all of the historically significant buildings around London. I have a long standing fear of falling and initially was rather nervous but because the rate of ascent and descent is very slow I was able to adapt and enjoy myself. I would highly recommend the champagne cruise to all adults. The River cruise was nice. The young man who did the commentary was very knowledgeable about the historical significance of the buildings on either side of the Thames. We initially sat up top but the rainy drizzle forced us inside. It was a nice ride but somewhat anticlimactic after our ride on the London Eye. I would recommend doing the river cruise first and the London Eye afterwards. Both are very worthwhile.,Fantastic. Memorable. Highly recommended.
"May 3, 2015",Can't rate the fast pass highly enough. Friendly staff. Very accommodating. Pods not packed. Fantastic experience. 10/10. Well done London eye. Tourist attraction done 100%.,A Nice View
"May 3, 2015","The London Eye was a very good experience. The line was very long but moved quickly. The views from the Eye were amazing, we got some really good pictures of Buckingham Palace and the other great sites around London. A must see when visiting London. ",Great combi ticket
"May 1, 2015",If you visit the London Eye you can go on the boat ride for free. We really recommend you do this as the Tower bridge from the water is an impressive sight. The gudies have a great knowledge about the historical buildings so you get a good general overview in a short period of time. Get there early so you can have a good seat in the front of the boat ,nice views
"March 9, 2015","the ride was nice. it was sunny the day we went there so we enjoyed breathtaking views. the ride took maybe 30 minutes. the queue was not long and we didnt wait more than 10 minutes, but maybe in summer it's not the same ",Truly Eye Opening Experience
"March 9, 2015",It is well worth visiting to get unforgettable views of London and beyond. The queues were long but moved quickly. The staff were friendly and kept a good atmosphere with the customers.

"March 5, 2015","Amazing view! We went there early morning, no queues at all! If you want to go and not expand 2/3 hours in the line, go EARLY! We were there in the beggining of autumn, no pollution to perfectly watch London city view. The angle you can get of the Parliament and Tower Bridge is also amazing.",enjoyed the experience
"March 4, 2015","There are all sorts of ""packages"" you can buy for this attraction...we just got the regular ride and enjoyed ourselves.  Keep in mind that in your ""pod"" are many other tourists...on our particular pod....the really ""great"" spot (that lets you take perfect pictures of Parliament, Big Ben and other great buildings) was taken by a man and wife and their three children.  They were ""dug-in"" and were not willing (upon requests of everyone else on the pod) to move so that others could get a shot.  It wasn't the sort of thing that ruined the trip....just be aware that it can happen..and they are certainly within their rights....so it just is what it is...next time though, we might consider springing for a more private ride.   Another thing worth noting...we went on a rainy day...it was pouring!  Don't let this stop you from going!  The view was still there (though less than perfect..) but the cool thing was this:  we paid regular price, our wait time was less than 10 minutes...whilst in the line...there were so few people buying the ""fast track"" tickets...that they opened up the fast track line for us commoners.  It was great!  True, we were all a bit cold and wet...but honestly..I'd rather have that than to wait for the long lines (I've heard you can wait four hours or more...not sure its worth that...)  so if you are willing to brave a less than perfect weather day...you are likely to benefit.   We had planned on only going to look at the eye..when we got there and saw how short the line was, we went for it.  I'm glad we did. We were killing time before our river boat cruise....this is an easy walk across a bridge from where the boats (dis)embark....  great and busy fish n chips shop nearby.",See it all from Here
"March 3, 2015",You can see much of central London from here.  Opt for the skip in line tickets and take plenty of pictures to remember your time there.  then take a walk or run along the River Thames.,"Fun, brilliant view of the skyline"

"March 2, 2015","If you go on the London eye, take a river cruise. You get a discount for 2 attractions. Well worth the visit. You can sit inside or on top. It was cold on the day we went so we sat inside. This is not a problem as the view is still very good and the guide is very knowledgeable. There's also somewhere to get a drink and snacks.",Enjoyable trip
"March 2, 2015","Really enjoyable, the river cruise was a brilliant way to see lots of sights and get a brilliant commentry by staff. Lots of photo opportunities and only takes 40 minutes if time is an issue. The London eye was brilliant, the night flight amazing.",Still over priced
"March 1, 2015","We bought our tickets online for a ""discount"" price and paid £39.80 for 2 adult tickets on the 1pm ride.Really not sure why they give you a specific time as you'll be queuing for around 20/30 mins in a jumbled mish-mash que with no proper system.We took my baby daughter along with us in a pram and were told it had to be folded before getting in the capsule (once folded it actually takes up more room as it separates into 2 pieces but there we are).In the queue you have your picture taken, the photographer was either blind or hated babies as she completely cut my daughter out, even though I was holding the carrier up purposefully for her to be in the picture.The flight itself was ok, saw a few of the land marks and the screens in the capsule are helpful to let you know what's where.Definitely not worth 20 quid each but was ok for a once in a decade trip.",Wonderful views
"March 1, 2015",Came here in October on a cold clear day. The sights of London in my opinion are unrivalled and the eye gives a view of all of londons beautiful sights.,Gotta Do It!
"March 1, 2015",You gotta do this.  It's a great experience and the views are fantastic.  We went on a cloudy day and it was still breath taking!,Even in the rain..........
"February 28, 2015",I've already reviewed the London Eye which I gave excellent even in the rain.The boat trip was good despite the pouring rain. The service and commentary was good. I would say the only issue I have is that the seats at the front downstairs need replacing due to wear and tear and they should be higher as the windows for the front rows are higher than further back and standing is discouraged.I did enjoy this trip and would recommend it.,An eye for an eye
"February 28, 2015","The London eye has always been one of these attractions I kept telling myself I must do that the next time in here. Well finally after countless trips to London I booked the fast track ticket to get on the London eye for 1430. The whole process was fast indeed. We got our photos taken before viewing a wonderful short film of London in 4D  which is free so you really can't complain at that. We then made our way out to the eye and entered the fast track dedicated queue, which was empty, while the other line had maybe 40 people waiting. Within a few seconds we were in a pod and on our way to the top of the world...well London at least. The rotation takes 30mins and I do believe it did take an hour at one stage so I did feel slightly robbed at this fact. However, 30mins seemed to be ample to take in the sights and I can understand why the rotation has been increased...more money less waiting. The views were good when I was there and I managed to see beyond Wembley stadium and I spotted all the popular attractions. One thing that did irritate me was the photo section at the end. I didn't actually get a chance to get my photo whilst on the eye as each photo section was bombarded by a rather rude family (the same family on both sections) which I thought was quite unfair and very selfish of this family to do so. Overall it was a good experience although flawed in some areas regarding photo opportunities so maybe some tweaking is needed in this so all persons within a pod get their photo taken at the end. ","Nice view, fun for the kids"
"February 27, 2015","Did this once with a co-worker a few years ago and again tonight with my 13yr old daughter. We both really enjoyed it. Buy the tickets online to save a few bucks and skip the line. Great view, nice interactive aids on the ride, comfortable and smooth ride. I have also done the Shard and while the view is better from the Shard, the experience is more entertaining on the London Eye.",Use your coupons from the Stansted-Express!
"February 24, 2015",We used the Stansted-Express to go from the airport to the city and they give you some brochures where you can find coupons inside (wide variety of attractions and more) and we use the coupons for the London Eye and got half-priced tickets for each person.The sight of the London Eye is beautiful - would recommend a ride at night. It's worth it and you'll definetly get some nice pictures.,London eye
"February 24, 2015","went for ride on the London eye for the first time, the eye gives great views of London and the map gives you all the directions if you are not familiar with the landscape The ride takes about 30 mins which is just about right Great time ",Amazing
"February 24, 2015","Went to london eye after my partner and my son talked me in to it!as I'm petrified of heights was quote unforgettable exspieriance!im glad I did as it realy was amazing.really good for value of money,hoever you have to que for a bit! But is well worth a visit!",Its Historic no other thing Special
"December 27, 2014","After shelling out huge amount if you are willing to stand at a place for more than a hour then you may visit this place. However I would personally not recommend, you can get a better view of London when you board your plane. The charges are way high and there is nothing special about it. instead enjoy the scenic beauty of London eye from outside.ONE BIG TIP - Many frauds are seen near London eye, do not get involved in any gambling games with the men who claim to double your money (have seen many people loosing money), they basically fool people and do have a license for gambling and is completely illegal, would face an arrest if spotted by the Police.",Offensive tour guide
"December 19, 2014","Tour was fine, level of information was average but my lasting impression is that I was gobsmacked at the tour guide's cliched, misogynistic comments about women. If he actually set out to offend half of his audience, good work!",The best way to do The Eye
"December 14, 2014","Warm indoor waiting area, fast-track entry, private pod, waiter and a glass of fizz to sip whilst watching London open up before you.  And all for only a couple of quid more than a standard fast-track ticket, what's not to love?We went after dark and it was an absolutely magical start to an evening on the town. Can't recommend highly enough.",Circular river tour
"December 12, 2014","Starting from the London Eye Pier, which is just a walk across Westminster Bridge,  this 40 minute cruise was just right for the short time we had.  Our visitor was delighted with views of Tower Bridge and the Globe, and even more by the silhouette of the Gherkin, Walkie-Talkie and Cheesegrater. There was a really useful commentary, and other language audio versions.  By this time of year this was the only river tour we could find where you could just stay on the boat.",Never again
"December 3, 2014","It's one of those things you have to do and never do again and the London eye is exactly that , they fail to mention when you purchase the ticket that you will be queuing for ages unless you want to fork out even more money for fast track by the time we got on it it was getting dark never again very boring spend your money on something else.",Great and very well organised!
"December 1, 2014","Loved this, it's very well organised and worth every penny! Fantastic views on a lovely clear day. Great",Great Views
"November 30, 2014",Went on the eye on Friday 31st October 2014 during frequishly warm temperatures and clear blue sky's. Large queues with around 3 hour waiting time. Worth paying extra £10 for fast track entry taking around 15 minutes wait. Fabulous views over the city for around 25-30 minutes rotation.,Spectacular at night
"November 30, 2014",Enjoyed a superb view of London by night. Excellent pictorial guide in the cabin locating all the main  architectural treasures London has to offer.,Fast Track is the way to go!
"November 30, 2014","If you would like to avoid the queues and get straight on to the London Eye, buy a Fast Track or Champagne experience ticket, it adds to the whole experience too.The 4D show is good fun and is included in the price of the ticket. Obviously, the better the weather, the better view, but it is an experience and gives a great view over London.",Overestimated
"November 22, 2014",We went to London eye a few months ago and I found it very expensive and overrated ... I don't think it worth a visit ...,Well worth the money. Buy tickets in advance.
"March 30, 2011","If you want to see the whole of London visit the Eye. The views are great. On Monday morning there was no queue. We tried first on Friday evening but the queues to both tickets and then the eye were long. For Monday we bought the tickets in advance at a kiosk and were able to just walk in. Again, as almost always in London, the staff were great.",Nice Experience
"March 29, 2011","Had a Merlin Annual Pass but still had to queue, waited for half an hour till we got on. (They let groups of schoolkids fastrack the queue!) Our pod was pretty packed, had to squeeze in to get a view out of the window. Got very hot as you got to the top (and that was on a spring day- can imagine how hot it gets on a summers day!) Luckily there is air conditioning on the sides. Brilliant views of London and you can get a photo done at the end. Takes about half an hour to get around, really enjoyed it, will be going again as i forgot to take my camera this time!",Amazing! Views are incredible!
"March 12, 2011",We booked combination tickets online before we went. We arrived first thing in a morning and there wasnt much of a queue. The pods are quite big and the views were breath taking! The pics we took turned out fantastic! The 4D Experience was fab too! Would defo recommend! when we go again we are going to go on at night time and see how that looks!,"Pick your weather, companions and times of day."
"March 1, 2011",I think we were very lucky. Our daytime trip was on a colourful bright morning where everything looked clear and close and the views were absolutely spectacular. Better I think than those from the Empire State Building. The speed is just right. Make sure if you possibly can that the other passengers are tolerable and considerate. Frustrated disinterested kids or sullen miserable adults do not enhance the experience. We went back a year later in the dark evening which was amazing. Weather and visibility are everything.,Impressed with the service
"February 27, 2011",Booked the eye on line for a visit with my parents for a special weekend. Ok so it was rainy so the views could have been better but hey ho we live in the UK so used to that.What has prompted me to write the review is the exceptional customer service we received from the eye staff. I had booked the tickets for a set time - picked them up and we were due on at 11. There was quite a long queue which we were ok with but when the staff saw my dad with his stick (not officially disabled but 80 with knee problem) they pulled us out of the queue and walked us slowly and kindly to the front then stopped the eye so dad could take his time getting in. Great experience seeing everything on the pod (once in lifetime for my folks) and then when we got off they stopped it again to give him time to get off.Lovely people who didn't need any official stuff to understand that someone needed a little more time to enjoy the experienceThank you eye staff you made all of our days,Be CAREFUL of cash transactions in gift shop
"July 21, 2010","My husband and I visited the London eye on Monday June 7th.We really enjoyed the experience.Afterwards  I bought souvenir gifts for our 4 children.I paid cash.The tall male on the till had an American accent and was very loud and distracting,shaking one item 3 times to 'check' that it wasn't broken and speaking in a very loud voice to no one in particular.I had to request a receipt following the transaction.I realised when leaving the shop and counting my change that  he had overcharged me.When I checked  my receipt I got a shock to see that only ONE item was on my receipt.I had purchased and paid for 7 items and extra.Unfortunately I couldn't re-enter the shop because now I had 6 items with no proof of purchase and technically could be called a shop lifter.So my advice to you all is REQUEST a receipt BEFORE you hand over your cash.",Please don't waste your money here!  It's a tourist rip-off now.
"July 14, 2010","I went on the London Eye for the third time yesterday when my American cousin was in town.  The last time I had been on was 4 years ago and it was a very special experience as we went on a night flight and it was quiet and peaceful.  Also, 4 years ago the cost was only around £8.00 as the London Eye was owned by BA.Imagine my shock yesterday to find that the cost was £17 per person (what inflationary measure had they used there?!!!) and the attraction had been taken over by Merlin Entertainments (the UK's answer to Disney and all that corporate rip-off).  Also, although I am on benefits that give me discounts at all galleries, concerts and most attractions, there were no discounts available at all.  I also felt that the Eye itself is looking a little tired.  One pod had a free-standing air conditioning unit in it.  One pod went around empty for some reason and one pod was missing altogether.  For the cost now charged - everything should be in tip-top condition.  Even the staff seeing us on were of poorer quality then then used to be!The only good thing is that we purposely chose a quieter time of week and day than most people so we didn't wait long and the queue moved fast.  We also didn't waste time on stupid 4D movies.  If the queue had been long we wouldn't have bothered.The pod was full and, whereas on my previous flights people walked around the pod to see different sights, when you are on the flight with tourists (sorry tourists!) they don't think there are any interesting buildings on the south bank of the river!!!  So they take up residence in the best position overlooking the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace and stay there the whole time - not letting anyone else in.I wouldn't recommend pre-booking either as it would be a very poor experience to have booked tickets then find that the weather is grey and wet and the visibility poor. In conclusion, if you MUST go on the London Eye and have decided that views from St. Paul's / the walkway above Tower Bridge / Monument /  or out on Hampstead Heath / Greenwich / Shooters Hill / Alexander Palace just won't do - please think outside the box and go in the evening and in good weather.",Waste of money
"June 11, 2010","My 8 year old wanted to be on it as it looked so giant and fun etc.etc.... But what a waste of money. First of all it is way expensive for the ride. Spending all that money for a family of four just to be on it for a short time was a total waste of time and money. See it from a distance and spend your money else where. Long lines for waiting, they wouldn't let one member stay in line for all and them let the others join later.",London Eye - Well worth it!
"May 3, 2010","I am a bit scared of heights, but the London Eye is a very gentle 'ferris wheel' where you can see all of London.  We took numerous photos at each 'stop.'  So enjoyable.But, even better than the view is the Champagne Flight.  I highly recommend pre-purchasing tickets via VisitBritain.com.  In addition to already having the tickets and thus, avoiding the wait, you can make your purchase in American dollars.  With our vouchers in hand, we were whisked on to the attraction within minutes, while we saw some many people lined up to go on.  Plus, there are a lot less people in your individual 'pod.'  And, if you like champagne, it's a delight.  The guy that served us was very nice and offered to tell us anything about the sights.  We also received a booklet for free outlining the various attractions (I can't remember the cost, but it was extra for the others.)I heard that the Eye was going to be dismantled last year and perhaps only kept for the 2012 Olympics.  I think that would be a shame!  In the 10 years that it's been in London, I believe it has become a great fixture to the town.  Highly recommend going and also having the champagne!",Brilliant!
"April 26, 2010","The title says it all ...The new 4D experience (included in ticket price) was fantastic ... it had the adults amazed as much as the kids.  Excellent use of 3D cinematography with a little extra to make it seem all the more real (won't say here as don't want to spoil it for you).  The ride on the Eye was on a clear day and thirty minutes was just about the right amount of time to take it all in.  Had three nine year olds and a hyper six year old with me and none of them got bored.This is a London must do and if you follow the advice on the London Eye website and turn up and check in 45minutes before your ""flight"" it runs like clockwork and stress free despite the site being a pretty busy place.  I'm not sure I'd bother with the extra expense of a fast track ticket ... we just had a standard flexi and we didn't queue for very long at all.  We visited on a normal Sunday in mid April.",London Eye
"September 7, 2008","I recently combined a trip to the London Eye and the London Aquarium and can certainly recommend it.You will get a great view of the Houses of Parliament, Westminster, the river and the surrounding area.The ride is very smooth and we had a pod to ourselves and so were able to walk around are really take in the sites.My main recommendation is to follow the weather. If you are in London for a couple of days then it is worth trying to get a clear day. Early morning would work best as you then have time to see the sites in the surrounding area.",Worth it!  Great views of London
"May 23, 2008","We enjoyed the London Eye today.   We almost didn't stop because the line looked a bit long... but decided to go for it.   This was on a Thursday around 6pm.We were in line no more than 7 mins.  The line moved quickly.  We didn't have the fast track/pass... just the regular tix that we bought on the spot.  We were with someone thats a bit ""hesitant"" of heights but they really enjoyed it... the ride is very very smooth and moves so slowly that you really don't feel the movements.  Great views of course and lovely in the late afternoon.  I'm sure evening would be great also.  I think at now in the Spring they close at 8pm... so I don't know if there is a true night-time viewing.Worth It!Enjoy.",Do this at night for maximum effect
"May 13, 2008","We were lucky and did not have a long line to wait in. They are pretty heavy on security-especially with big bags, they do look inside them. It's great lit up and there is a great view from and on the  water. It was awesome to see Big ben and Houses of Parliment from above as well. You will share a pod with other people, so don't be surprised, everyone stands and can even walk around, but there  are benches for those who need seating. This is not recommended for those uncomfortable with heights-because you are encased in a clear pod, you can see all around you and that may be disconcerting for some. We saw all ages on board and everyone seemed to enjoy it. It is pricey though-but you can charge it :)",Waste of time and money
"May 8, 2008","I expected a guide, or even a recorded message to play during the 30 minute trip, maybe pointing out some things of interest or what not.I was mistaken. It's just you and a handful of strangers in a small pod for half an hour, in awkward silence.For the price I'm sure you could visit other more interesting tall buildings/cathedrals/etc. to get the same views. If you must go, the best time to do it would be on a regular weekday (non-holiday), and take the first 'trip' at 10am. We bought regular, non-fast track tickets online before going, and then showed up at the ticket office at 9:30am. We were the very first people to step into the pod that day, no waiting, and no need to pay for the fast-track.",Interesting views
"March 25, 2008","What can I say...........it is a one of a kind experience and the views are spectacular.  The cost, not unlike everything in London, is very expensive, so get used to it quickly or it may ruin your holiday.  We saved a little by booking on-line which also saves you a ton of time picking up your tickets at the kiosk, just put in your card you paid for the tickets with and out they come.  The line-ups look enormous but at 30 people per car they move along very quickly.  Worth the money just in picture value alone.........bring a zoom lense.",Tip for large parties
"July 24, 2007","I went on the London Eye as part of a hen weekend.  There were 15 of us, and we booked a private pod, which only worked out to be about £5 more per head.  The difference this made to the experience was huge.  We went to a seperate desk, waited a couple of minutes and were then escorted over to the eye where we bypassed all the queues and got on the next available pod.  If you are considering going on the Eye and you are a large party, it is definately worth doing this - it made all the difference.Having said that the queues did look like they moved quite fast, but if you have a lot of people and a schedule to stick to its definately the way to go!I can't comment on the actual booking procedure, because my friend actually booked it in person a couple of months before, but I'm sure the website will give you all the info.",Breathtakingly Beautiful
"June 28, 2007","The London Eye is modern, spectacular, gargantuan and beautiful. The London Eye provides visitors with views across the world's most famous city and the views do not disappoint. One can see world famous landmarks, such as The Palace of Westminster, St. Paul's Cathedral, Buckingham Palace, the BT Tower, Canary Wharf, the list is endless. The Eye is a world-renowned landmark, it is an architectural masterpiece. The London eye is a beautiful, modern structure that symbolises a new, modern and successful London. It is undoubtedly a truly breathtaking creation.",Something different
"June 20, 2007","I start by admitting I am not a great fan of London as such but do have friends who live here so I do go back every once in a while. Having ''done'' all the usual touristy things in previous years, we thought the London Eye would be a nice change. And it surely was ! We booked online (as recommended by our friends) which was a good move as we bypassed all the queues. We were lucky and had beautiful weather so it was a real treat to see London from above and even make out the new Wembley Stadium in the distance. After the tour we strolled around the much improved South Bank area and had a spot of lunch in one of the many restaurants with outside tables (which makes great people watching)Considering what most tourist attractions cost in Edinburgh, Scotland taking a ride on the London Eye was not that expensive and really, the views are worth it. The wheel actually moves very slowly - in fact you can't even feel it move (I am saying his because many people asked me who were too scared to go on it) but it really is very pleasant. The capsule is big enough to walk around or sit in the middle if you wish.Also, you get a superb view of the whole architecture as such while the Eye moves and it makes for some interesting pictures.",A must for everyone
"June 9, 2007","As I live quite close to London it was a pleasant surprise when my daughter suggested that we took her little boy (my grandson) up to town one day. They were staying with us and she thought that a trip on the British Airways London Eye might be nice.We only waited for a few minutes for tickets and then a few more minutes to actually board the flight. The day was a bit dull but that meant you could take photographs without getting too many reflections. Upstream views included St Thomas' Hospital close by and views of the river bending away to the right towards Battersea. On a clear day you can see as far as Windsor Castle. But don't get carried away with distant views when almost directly in front of you is a wonderful view of the the Palace of Westminster. In part of this building are the houses of Lords and Commons and I swear you see the haze of hot air coming up from it!!Looking downstream (Right) the river quickly bends away to the right and affords nice views of the City of London, St Paul's and many bridges and churches. The view of the roof of Waterloo Station is stunning.Look to the north (rive end of the pod!) to see the post office tower. If you have a map with you you can pin point Horseguards Parade, St James Park, New Zealand house, the RAF Memorial on the opposite bank of the river and many more sights. As a senior citizen it cost me £11.00 to fly the wheel and I can't wait to go again.",What an experience!
"May 2, 2007","The London Eye - half an hour of amazement!We queued from right at the back of the last 'boarding gate' at 12.30pm on a sunday, but it only took us half an hour to get into our 'capsule'.  I think this was a very busy time, because we saw very little queues on Sunday afternoon and all day Monday (we were only staying round the corner)It was very organised.  There were some cute souvenirs.  I'd recommend buying te 360 degree guide so you can pick out buildings when you are in the air.  We didn't buy it and didn't know what we were looking at apart from the obvious buildings!I don't THINK I'd do it again.  Then again, I haven't been on it at night time yet!Even though the capsules are air conditioned, it still got hot at the top, even in April!Enjoy!",London Eye? What a pain!
"March 2, 2010","The London Eye was a big let down. Not by the eye itself, the views were stunning asw was the 4D film beforehand.  The biggest let down was the queue's that seem to go no where. We purchased tickets from the original tour co. and we still had to queue in the (ahem ,say this quite sincerely) fast track ticket desk. The staff didn't know how to cope with the different methods of pre booking tickets and the fast track become the terracotta tourists exhibit on the Thames. I would recommend London, i wouldn't recommend the London EYE. All they have done is taken a big wheel and thought of the most difficult way to get passengers on.","London Eye, brilliant"
"February 10, 2010","We finished our London experience with The Eye, and it was the perfect way to close, we went on a sunday evening, No queue, only a few others in our pod, just fabulous.The view is stunning and all reasonable value",Great overview of London
"January 16, 2010",The view from the top of the London Eye is amazing. To maximize the experience you should go when the weather is clear and bring along binoculars to get the most out of the experience.,You must do this!
"January 11, 2010","Excellent attraction. Wonderful views. Never realised how big London is until you see it from so high up. We went at 4pm so we saw the city at sunset then as the lights were coming on, beautiful. The pods are comfortable and you don't feel like you are moving. I hate heights but was fine on this. The only complaint is that the ticket office is a bit of a shambles with queues everywhere, and the same for waiting to get on the eye. I would advise paying the extra for fast track, especially if you are only there for a couple days. Well worth it.","Ride time is shortened, but the ticket price has gone up!!"
"August 17, 2009","Under British Airways the London Eye ride used to be 30 mins. But Now under the new management (Merlin Entertainments Group) the ride time is shortened to less then 20 mins. This is very funny because the ticket prices has gone up, before it was about 12 pounds and now it over 14 pounds.  No value for money.!!!!",Great views
"July 14, 2009","I thought the ride offered great views of London, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We were there in October 2008 and we went in the evening so we could see the night lights of London. What a great time! We took beautiful photos from the Eye, our pod had maybe 6 people in it total, and it was warm even though the air outside was frigid.",OK
"December 3, 2008","As everyone says - the queues are LONG! I was a little disappointed, not sure why really, as I'm not sure I could have expected more than what we got. We went on a clear day in summer and the views were good but I'm not sure it's worth what they charge for it. There are more interesting ways to spend your time in London.",London Eye

"September 11, 2003","I thought the London Eye was absolutely excellent and well worth the money it costs to get on it. whilst on the Eye, you feel very safe, particularly since each pod is bomb-checked between each party that rides in it. The only thing that was slightly annoying was the dripping water which splattered us form time to time, and it can get pretty hot (obviously!) in those pods. Overall, a must if you are visiting London; you'll regret it if you don't!",Eyes for a Beautiful View!
"October 2, 2023",Grand view and mesmerising to see the venue and the surroundings!! On a clear day you can get some fabulous pictures and rides !,Great views
"August 23, 2023",It was good but not great. Quite a few people in the pod so couldn't see all of the views. Nicely air-conditioned though. Views were lovely though ,Good Deal if bought as a combo
"October 4, 2022","The attraction is overpriced if you buy just a standard ticket.The best value for money is if you buy a combo ticket that gives you Madame Tussaud, Sealife, London Eye and Cruise for 68 pounds (from the londoneye website). At the time of writing this, the 4D experience at London eye was discontinued, so that was a dampener.Go to the website, and buy a combo for Madame Tussaud, Sealife and London Eye that costs 60 pounds. During checkout it will give you an option to add a cruise for 8 pounds. These four are perfect for a full-day family outing with kids. Do Madame Tussauds in the morning (10am), followed by stopover at Buckingham Palace (optional), then go on to the London eye pier and grab a nice fish & chips lunch. Follow that up with Sea life, London Eye and finally the cruise (they are all adjacent to each other).You will be able to fin all this by around 5.30pm. Relax at the riverback with a nice icecream cone and watch the sun set. A busy but relaxed itinerary that will be fun for the kids as well. If you are still feeling energetic, you could try squeeze out a visit to Trafalgar square in the evening by bus, and visit the National gallery for some cool paintings.",Pre-booking time slot is an absolute joke!!!
"July 27, 2022",WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!You need to make it obvious on your booking sites that when you book your time... this is the time you can actually join the already ridiculously long queue and is NOT the time you actually access the attraction!! Our tickets were for 2.30 and we got there in plenty of time to join the queue so we could get on the London Eye at our allotted time. However we were kicked out of the queue twice and not allowed to join the queue itself until exactly 2.30pm.Very very disorganised and staff attitudes are shocking. Not what you expect from such a highly priced event.Event organisers don’t understand the knock on effect the time slot problem has on other planned activities/travel etc. The time we eventually got on the London Eye was an hour and half from the time slot booked so what is the point in pre-booking I just don’t get it.The pre-booking time slot is an absolute joke and false advertising that you need to rectify or you will continue to have some very angry customers!!Sort it!,Total caos.
"July 26, 2022","It’s my second time in London Eye. I should say that was disapointed the way It’s organizated the entrance to the wheel. There were caos every were! A long line to get to the next “control Point”, but we wasn ‘t check anywere. No body ask our tickets, a girl tryed to send us to make the long first line again. In the middle of the caos of the line, my wife luckily got a ticket with a pink mark, if that hasn’t happened we would had to do the line again.There were people of the staf shouting everywere but they were unable to control the situation.It Was very unpleasant experiencie.Of course the “fligth” is an amazing way to get a view of the city, but they need que get improve in the way they organize the entrance.",Insightful and fun tour.
"October 30, 2020","Done the tour during the half term break. Safely boarded and all temperatures taken. Must say it is a great tour made even better by our host, Scottish boy called Liam, he had a fantastic sense of humour and gave great history and his own take and recommendations on the sights. Highly recommend and 5 stars for the tour guide himself.",Good experience 
"October 30, 2020",The kids have been wanting to do this for a while and they loved it! Good views even though it was raining - got to see everything! Not sure on the tier 2 rules - as we were with another family in our pod?  Would recommend but quite pricy and you can see just as much in the walkie talkie tower which is free or the shard which you could combine dinner! ,Family visit
"October 29, 2020","Visited London Eye with my family,such an amazing place to go,great time and amazing emotions,would recommend to every body",Heights
"October 27, 2020",My partner and I going all the way to the top he was so worried as he dont like heights was such a nice time will be bringing my little one with us next year,As good as its looks...
"October 27, 2020",The London Eye offers a fantastic view across the massive city fo London. Point to note - the queues were almost non-existent primarily down to the current covid situation. ,Not worth it
"October 26, 2020",I wouldn't really recommend this because i really didnt think it was worth it for that much money.I feel like other places are better than just a view.,Highly recommended
"October 26, 2020","It was difficult to decide which of the Thames boat tour companies to choose, but I'm so glad we booked the London Eye river cruise on a joint ticket with the London Eye.  Jack gave an excellent witty commentary which even kept my young teenage granddaughters interested. One commented ""He made you want to listen. He wasn't boring"" which is the highest compliment from a teenager. Highly recommended",Beautiful sight
"October 26, 2020",The sight of the ferris wheel both on and off are a treat. I love the great view of the city especially at night! I imagine it could also be very romantic. ,Fantastic
"October 26, 2020","Booked a last minute trip to london. Was travelling with my husband and 3 children (14,8 and 4) We all loved the river cruise. Mick was a brilliant guide and made us all laugh lots (even the teenager!) He even sung happy birthday to our 4 year old.London eye was also fantastic. As we are a family of 5 and no queues we had a pod to ourselves. The kids all thought this was amazing and was fantastic to be able to move around and not worry about social distancing! A big thank you for the memories we made!",London Eye
"October 26, 2020",Many photos like Big Ben and River Tames. Would be good on a sunny day as it was raining when I did London Eye. Would like to do again.,Personal pod
"September 11, 2020",Due to COVID 19 there were no queues for the pods. We had pre booked anyway using our Merlin passes. We went straight on and had our own pod!,First time visit
"September 11, 2020","This was our first time on the London Eye and with having series height issues I must admit it was truly amazing, so breathtaking were the views that I wanted to stay on and go round again. Can really recommend this as one of the best things to do in London. Can't wait to go on it again. Its such a cool thing to do. Thanks to all the staff also.",Awesome experience!
"September 10, 2020","Absolutely awesome!! I have to be honest: I was scared stiff and had dreams of lying down on the seat with my eyes closed for the whole 30 minutes, the night before, but not necessary! It was scary stepping on and  off, and for those a little faint hearted, have someone to hand to help you and don't stand near the edge of the pod, but other than that, it was brilliant.  The views are stunning especially in the good weather we had. The Eye moves so slowly that at first you dont realise you are moving and I did eventually manage to leave the safety of the seat. Unrivalled, especially with the disappointment of The Shard being closed for our booked visit. Highly recommended and well worth the money.",Scenic
"September 8, 2020","Really clear views high  across London,  we had the whole pod to ourselves which was an added bonus !  Would recommend you  go on the Eye as part of a ""Attraction "" deal as maybe a bit hefty a price on its own ","Great views, great value"
"September 2, 2020","We went to the lastminute.com London Eye, as we were going to London from Manchester and we had never been to the London Eye, although we had been to Central London several times. It was quite expensive for 2 adults and 1 child but we had used a £20 Tesco Clubcard voucher, and we paid the rest by card.At the main day, staff checked our temprature and let us in, like most attractions in this COVID time. We had photos taken both in and out of the pod and we went in to the pod, which only had 2 other households in it. I felt that might be a bit uncomfortable in this COVID period, the pod was a bit huge, so it was easy for social distancing. Like they said, there was some great views! Even though I think £2 for a soveniur coin is a bit expensive, the pods were very clean and overall, it was a great experience! They also give you a 30% voucher for lastminute.com.","Great cruise, a fun way to learn."
"September 2, 2020","Great cruise, Jack who was our tour guide very informative and funny! It’s a great way to learn about the city.",Fill in time 
"August 31, 2020",It was ok but not worth £60 to go round in a circle  I suppose I’m not the best one to comment as I prefer to see things up close and personal ie major land marks but no one insisted I go on so maybe I should just shut up 🤐😂,"Overpriced but,"
"August 30, 2020","I must say that this experience is genuinely overpriced for what it is. At the end of the day you're going on a ""modified Ferris wheel"" so I think that the ticket prices are quite over exaggerated. However, if you are a tourist, or you have never been on the London Eye, then I would still recommend it as you can get a great view on a good day. Just be prepared to save up some money for this specific attraction.",Fast track worth it
"August 30, 2020","We checked our 1st london to do list here, and it was the right decision. Beautiful 1st glance, and the time we saved from fast track spared us a lot to check on other attractions nearby rather than longer queue.Despite big ben was still under major renovation, but the view from here was really splendid.Great service from the staff also. ",not covid friendly sadly
"August 30, 2020",The eye itself is good but in covid times there is no distancing whilst waiting in line and you have other people in your pod. We are a 5 and another group of 4 joined us. They had no respect to stay on their side which bothered and was not wearing a 😷,Great experience
"August 11, 2020",We really enjoyed this experience and were lucky not to have to wait in a queue before boarding . Good COVID-19 procedures in place. Great views of London from The pod . There was a short delay due to a technical problem during our trip but we were kept advised and the delay only lasted a few minutes . It is fairly expensive but in our view well worth it.,It’s pretty good.
"August 7, 2020","We got our tickets Madame Tussauds & London Eye together (£76) for the 2 of us.The London eye lasts about half an hour.We booked a set time (11am) but we still had about a 30 min wait.Due to the pandemic, staff were checking temperatures.The pods were limited to small numbers.The staff doing bag searches, it’s a very relaxed search, they definitely never checked inside our camera bag.Overall, the view is lovely, the pods were spotless.My only criticism, the tannoy in the pod is too loud.Would recommend.",Beautiful views
"August 5, 2020",Fantastic views of London’s main attractions from the top of one of London’s main attractions. It’s an absolutely must but highly recommend pre-booking tickets before coming because queues can sometimes get crazy ,What a view
"July 22, 2020","Been on the Eye a few times and always see something different, being at the top you can see for miles, even in the rain. Had the champagne experience which makes the experience better. ",Great experience!
"July 19, 2020","The London eye is amazing. At first I was nervous about going so high up, but right after the ride I wanted to go again and again. There was something so breathtaking about seeing London that high up. Highly recommend!",Early morning run
"July 18, 2020","Aghhhh how beautiful is it to wake up early in the morning and go for a run next to Thames, stop to a London eye and breath in the fresh air of wakening London. ",Not fast track
"December 15, 2020","So I paid the extra for the fast track when we got there was about 20 people in front, the lady said fast track go in the other way (excellent) only to be stopped at the top of the stairs and had to wait till everyone in the normal cue had been searched my the slowest security in the world so I won’t be paying extra againOn the ride it self the views are amazing even with it being a wet December morning ",Chloe
"December 15, 2020",My husband and I enjoyed an afternoon cruise along the river.Chloe our host was a cheerful lady who gave us a fantastic insight into some of the landmarks along the way.We learnt so much from her well presented guide with lots of laughs along the way.She is a credit to your company.,Family day out 
"December 14, 2020",The night view is the best especially during Christmas. COVID précautions taken very seriously! Kids loved it... the adults equally loved it too. ,London Eye: Do It just to do it
"November 18, 2020",The London Eye was fun. Don’t expect much from it besides long lines and a simple ride in a Farris wheel. The history lesson and views from the top are amazing! Worth doing just to say you did it.,slow
"November 14, 2020","maybe if it was faster it would be more enjoyable🙄✋ sis is just a big, slow enclosed ferris wheel. chariots of fire n dat",Great View. Slow moving
"November 14, 2020",Great view. 30 minutes of slow moving torture. I am scared of heights. Good  thing they had a place to sit down.,First date
"November 6, 2020","Went on a first date.Lovely experience.Was supposed to be sharing but the family after us refused to join our ride so we had it all to ourselves, maybe due to covid.Our temperatures were taken and hand sanitizer available.It's only one revolution but you do get great views of London. You are fully enclosed so sheltered from the elements which was raining most of the day.Would recommend if visiting London but pricey for what it is.",Experience 
"October 31, 2020",Good for an experience. A nice 30 minute trip to take in the sites of London. Good social distancing followed. ,Expensive but worth it
"October 31, 2020","Visited with my husband, 6 year old and 3 month old.  Booked tickets whilst there and only had to queue for 5 minutes.  We had our own pod and had a brill time.  Lasts about 30-40 mins so not too long and whilst it’s not something I’d do every time we’re in London it’s definitely an experience I’d recommend doing at least once.",A-star for Almiro
"October 30, 2020","We did the champagne experience with Almiro as our host, the whole experience was worth every penny and Almiro was brilliant couldn't have asked for a nicer bloke. He knew everything about the landmarks when asked and is a credit to the London Eye.From his Manchester mates 😎🤘🐝",Like a gentrified funfair without the fun 
"July 9, 2020","The chance to stand in a slowly revolving spheroid with mediocre views of the Thames, and pay an obscene amount of money for the privilege. Because of visiting friends and relatives I've been here several times over the years, and I've hated every single visit. ",Ferris wheel (London EYE)
"July 8, 2020","This Ferris wheel gives you an overwhelming experience through its capsules which take you up to great height likely above 100m and give you a landscape view of the whole city of London along with river THAMES.I got opportunity to visit in day time but someday will surely like to visit it during night...as its very fairly bright and twinkling.I think also one trip of single revolution took around 30/40 minutes ..You get to watch the 360 degree view of this most hyped place of England.There are benches in the center of the capsule as apart of seating.I had a clear view to see Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, The Tower and The Tower Bridge and the river Thames of course.There are so many souvenir shops around by ..It was worth it!",A visit to the ol country
"July 5, 2020",As you can see grandson was enamored .I am required to add more verbiage to make the cut.Was a good experience,Stunning views
"July 2, 2020","Really enjoyed the Eye, didn’t realise how tall it was, stunning views right across the capital. Had to queue a while to get tickets, but worth the wait. ",A breathtaking view 
"August 28, 2020","London eye is a famous site’s in London.The tickets prices were high but when go on the London eye and see the breathtaking view of London, the ticket prices is not the matters anymore.one cable of London eyes can carries 10-15 people, so I suggest you can bring your relatives to sit together, so you won’t worried about sitting to the stranger with you.overall, London eye can make you fall in love of London.",Overpriced
"August 27, 2020",Very overpriced for what it was. I thought in the current climate that they would limit the pods to one per family but this wasn’t the case & the pods were mixed with different families,Fantastic 
"August 26, 2020",What a fantastic experience but I do enjoy getting on the London Eye. On a good day you can get some fantastic pictures London look absolutely spectacular is here as a disabled person I get a half price ticket which is nice and the customer service team are really really good especially when helping you on and off off there car things the pod things that you sit in highly recommended,The best view of London
"August 25, 2020","Went with the Children, and they loved it, it was my wife and i's fourth time and we still love it, but for anyone who hasn't seen this view of london they really should put it high on their list",What a delight.
"August 24, 2020","We had a truly amazing experience.  I'm not sure if it was because it wasn't really too busy, or because of Corona virus, most groups had a pod to themselves, including us three.  It really enhanced the experience for us.  It was a beautifully sunny day and the views were incredible.  It was a really intimate experience for the three of us and really made our day.",Take this trip!!!
"August 19, 2020",Great option to complete both activities. The Thames cruise was really educational and took in all the main points of interest along the most famous stretch of the river. It also helped map out whet we wanted to do going forward during our stay. The London eye was a bit of a come down after the enjoyment of out tour guided river cruise but really enjoyed the experience. The only concern here was that they said they were limiting the pods to 8 but we had 13 in ours albeit from two families. All in all a great experience and well worth the money.,Good for half an hour
"August 19, 2020","We had Merlin passes at Christmas and so used them to get on the London Eye. It was great. The kids loved it, the staff were friendly and they give each pod a good clean before you get into them. ",Great
"August 18, 2020",Was here. Would recommend buying tickets on line earlier. Cheaper and faster. We waitwd 15 min to get on it.,Special
"August 16, 2020","Beautiful views of the city from the London Eye, it is so beautiful to see everything from up there that time inside the capsule flies by. The movement of the Ferris wheel is almost undetectable, so if you suffer from vertigo you can't feel it. Point against the price of the photos, they take beautiful photos of you inside the capsule and at the time of charging them, a photo comes out almost as the value from the entrance, that seemed a bit excessive","Nothing special, spend your time doing something more meaningful."
"August 12, 2020","Travelled in September 2017 the experience was Okay, the line was not that long but it is seriously overrated. Unless you get free tickets spend your money else where. So much to see and do in London don’t waste your time. Hire a bike for 1 hour  and ride around one of the many parks. Might be ok for people who live in England looked like mostly school groups.",Views!!
"February 26, 2020",Amazing way to see the views of London. I have been on the eye a couple of times and it is a great way to see the city. I will confess the manners of those who you are riding with can make it break your experience.,Nice views but crowded
"February 26, 2020",Maybe I'm no fun but I just don't think it's worth it.  It's hard to get a good picture when you share the space with so many other people.  It's fairly slow as well.  it is of course a great way to get a view of the city but it just wasn't for me.,Fab attraction!!
"February 25, 2020","Absolutely amazing views. It was the first time for me and I’d definitely recommend to anyone going to London, so enjoyable and the staff were lovely!! ",Ludicrously expensive
"February 25, 2020","Great views, run very slickly, stupidly expensive for a 30min Ferris wheel. And more opportunities to part with your money with souvenirs, photos etc.",Underwhelming
"February 24, 2020","Our experience of the London Eye was entirely underwhelming.  In fact, it's kinda boring and an expensive waste of time.  If you want a great view of London, go to the bar at the new Shard building, near Tower Bridge.  Have a drink, take in the view, and forget the Eye.  I don't get all the hype about the Eye.  Didn't do much for me or my family.",Our host was brilliant 
"February 14, 2020","We weren’t really sure what to expect , but booked a fizz package on the eye as part of our celebration . To be honest is was better that expected . The pre lounge and glass of fizz was great and the eye experience was excellent . Made so much more so due to our host ( we can’t remember his name something like Sam mho or something like that ( sorry , he’d been in holby city ) he was great , got everybody involved , informative, funny and really made a good experience into a great one . Well done . The cost was £90 for 2 people inc 4 glasses of champagne fast track etc . Well worth it we loved it thanks  ",So this is the London Eye!
"February 13, 2020","This, I found out, was a product (Coca Cola) of the US. It was a very entertaining attraction that was packed with people wanting to ride. The ride was very informative and you got to see many parts of London from a different perspective.",Nice ride with a beautiful voew over London
"February 13, 2020","I went there with my 2 teens daughters in a grey and cold winter day. We enjoyed our ride - in a very quite capsule with a couple - nothing to compare with the crowded days of summer.I am sure we would have enjoyed even more with a bit of sun to enlighten our pictures. Included in the ticket, a visit to the 4D cinema. To be done once in a lifetime!",Beautiful view
"February 13, 2020","The London eye gave us a beautiful view of the city. We didn’t have to wait in line. We were able to walk right in. I was thinking of buying skip the line tickets in advance to avoid the lines, but it’s a good thing I didn’t because we didn’t need them. It’s a must do while visiting London!","Amazing views, very expensive"
"February 12, 2020","If it's your first trip to London, this is something you really want to consider doing! You'll get great views of many other landmarks as well as being able to tick this big one off your bucket list! I personally find it very expensive for what it is but people will continue to pay that price so it wont change. Book in advance if you can.",Well...
"February 12, 2020",It's way too expensive! Sorry but that's just not worth it. Of course you'll get a nice view but nope...not for this price,A Bird’s Eye View
"February 12, 2020","My eight year old daughter learned about the London Eye in school, and when we planned our trip to London, all she could talk about was riding the London Eye. We were fortunate to have a cloudless sky which let us see for miles around us.",What a View!
"February 24, 2020",This is not your carnival ferris wheel by any means.  This thing is huge.  The car holds many people (as many as 20?).  The structure goes so high that you see over everything in all directions.  It takes about an hour to go all the way around and is a pretty incredible experience.  We did the express pass which was totally worth it.  The crowd waiting was huge and the line was long.  The extra money made it palatable for the kids to wait.  When you get on you realize this is going to be a little different.  A little scary and exhilarating at the same time.  The views are amazing and the photo ops are too.  Totally recommend it.,Great experience!
"February 24, 2020","Great experience, wonderful views, even with a fear of heights, really delighted that I did it! Wonderful photo ops. ",Quite Expensive
"February 24, 2020","When on this purely for the views, they didn't disappoint but it's quite pricey for what you get. I only had myself to buy a ticket for and can imagine it be very expensive if you had a family.",Very smooth
"February 24, 2020","We arrived late afternoon to go up the London eye. We used our tesco Clubcard vouchers so got it for a third of the price. The gentlemen manning the self serve ticket stations was very helpful. All staff were cheery and the whole operation was very slick. I can imagine at peak times it would get very busy but we were there mid Feb and practically got straight on. It was a clear day and the sun set just as we got to the top, magical!!!",Long ques
"February 24, 2020",It was a lovely day. Very very long line to que in. It was moving but slow.  Apparently an excellent view up there according to friends who waited patiently while I went to other attractions within the area. Great experience. Tickets are pricey. ,Super trip
"February 12, 2020","London eye is amazing, if you know little bit of London then you can see a view of all London around, and the River cruise...if you know where to go by a river, also very interesting",Must visit 
"February 12, 2020","Visited with my wife and I, 100% worth doing just to say you’ve done it! Great views of London and really nice area too..... if you can get a group of you and hire a pod .... even better !!!",Amazing night view of London
"February 11, 2020",Myself and family enjoyed the London Eye at night. We had an excellent nightime view of the city and took lots of pictures. The Eye rotates slowly so there is no rush. It is a huge structure but extremely well built and sturdy...no fear! The tickets are not cheap but there probably coupons. We enjoyed what is now an iconic London event.,Nice experience 
"February 23, 2020",Something that is required for anyone how visit london to see and experience. It is very huge and you can see the city from the top. Its really nice and worth to ride if you don’t get panic from high levels. ,Enjoyable 
"February 23, 2020","Came here on a Saturday and had a nice time. The views on a clear day are very good. I managed to get half price tickets, however I'm unsure if I would pay full price. ",Excellent must see 
"February 23, 2020",Loved it Tourist location Must see in London Walking distance from Buckingham palace Lots of sight seeing tour buses outside to see london ,Beautiful at night
"February 23, 2020",We have been on the London eye in the day so we decided this time to go in the evening.We didn’t queue we walked straight on which was nice and there was our family and one more family in our pod (another bonus) the view at night with all the lights were breathtaking I highly recommend going on a night. ,"Great views, long queues"
"February 23, 2020","Fabulous attraction - well worth a visit for the great views, plenty of room in each pod, to move around and take lots of great photosWe visited in feb- great sky and bit cold but still able to see lots of the recognisable building, all situated in SouthBank an interesting part of London - The 4D experience to finish off is priceless Only negative is the length of queues, not very friendly staff.Being forced to queue for photo options waste more time. But I think staff know how to move the queues fast!I would recommend but maybe guided to Make the most of it",Nice place to visit 
"February 22, 2020",We were able to see the 3D movie of the eye of London which was free and nice.nice to walk around the place but on our way to the Buckingham palace we took the double decker bus first time experience and I was thrilled ,First time in london
"February 21, 2020",This was brilliant.  So well organised. It is soooo high and you can see so much. A definite must if like me its your first time to London.  We got the binoculars from the shop beforehand but didn't really use them much.,Nice safe family environment
"February 21, 2020","Tourist attraction, safe family environment.  Takes about 30 minutes for the complete ride.  Make reservations in advance.",Good experience
"February 19, 2020",Nice experience while in London but I certainly wouldn't want to do it again. Souvenir section was very expensive too.,VIP experience
"February 19, 2020",VIP champagne experience well worth the extra charge. Cocktail in VIP lounge and champagne in the pod. Shira was an excellent host. Informative and happy to take lots of photos.,Birthday champagne visit
"February 10, 2020",Thoroughly recommend the champagne celebration. VIP treatment. Bypass all the queues. Amazing day. Wonderful treat. Our guide was so friendly and knowledgeable. She was such a lovely young lady.,Looks amazing!
"February 10, 2020","It looks great, but we didn't ride on it. The queue is very long. It will take you hours before you can get in. I have my toddler with me, she doesn't have patience to wait that long.",Brilliant and well worth the money
"February 9, 2020",Great staff and great activities. My daughter is a full time wheelchair user and the staff and organisation- and helpfulness of staff was second to none. We had no issues and they all did their very best to support us. Usually I worry about taking my daughter to these type of things but I have to say I need not have worried/ if you’re a wheelchair user or a member of your party is- I recommend this,worth it
"February 9, 2020",Quiet a long wait time but definitely worth the wait the views are nothing short of breath taking and a once in a lifetime treat.,Marvelous view over the city
"February 9, 2020","Marvelous view over the city, not quite so high than to be supposed. I liked much of the glass floor under my feet. A little bit scary!",Amazing thank you.
"February 8, 2020",i can not praise the staff enough at the eye today. Our daughter has additional needs and we were a little concerned about how she would cope. There were 9 of us together in total and when we got to the front of the line the lovely people that were assisting people on the eye allowed us to have one of the pods by ourselves which made the whole experience so magical and relaxed for us not worrying about her being loud and upsetting our tourists. Thank you so much to all the staff that helped us today you really did make our visits so magical.,it's a must tourist activity!
"February 7, 2020","to be in London and not to rotate 360 ​​° in the London Eye, is to miss a great fun, conviviality and the best view of the city, you can appreciate the magnitude of the River Thames and enjoy the contrast of historic buildings with modern buildings!",Wow
"February 7, 2020","A fabulous VIP trip with a glass of bubbly. We really enjoyed it, I only wish I could go round again.",Really great way to see most of London without walking
"February 6, 2020",If you don't like walking about and want to see London in about 30 minutes then use the London Eye as you will see everything for about 50 miles but bring binoculars because everything is that small you cant see much detail.I thought £79 for an adult and 2 kids was expensive for a big wheel  ride.The kids liked it.,Holiday
"February 5, 2020","Superb is the word.... No traveller to the UK shud miss this...tickets shud be bought online to avoid the rush.... Various combos are offerd..dont buy the binoculars,its a waste.... The views are spectacular... ",A 360 view of London City from River Thames
"January 28, 2020",Recommended for all even for people who quite nervous about heights. You do not feel any shaking of the cabin at all. Be ready with your binoculars if you have one. Be ready at the end of the revolving cycles as there will a photo opportunity at the designated photo spot coloured with pink and faced the camera when instructed. Don't  forget to smile!,Fab
"January 26, 2020",Myself and 4 year old went on in the dark. Deffo worth it with a bogof voucher (£30 for us both). She did enjoy it but did play a bit with her toys in-between.,Birthday treat 
"January 26, 2020",Was a bit disappointed with the weather in the morning as it was a bit misty but by 11am when we arrived for our flight it had cleared a lotHad been on here 15 years ago & it didn’t disappoint us one bitClear views around & got some photos I didn’t get last timeMy wife enjoyed her birthday treat Well worth the money ,A mandatory experience in London !!
"January 23, 2020","One of the best views in UK and London , a mandatory experience for every first visitor , Thame river cruises and a huge high view experience",Stunning 
"January 22, 2020","Very nice view, a nice place to walk around with friends and family. If you visit it in winter don't  forget to bring a good jacket, is very windy around. ",Just a huge ferriswheel
"January 18, 2020",Find a good spot for a picture of this huge ferris wheel and move it on to know London...you good even ride on it ; we did not even check prices because it was in maintenance.Not much to say...,Relaxing
"January 18, 2020","Their staff would ask if it's a family tour , thereby they would place you to one cell. This made our tour more enjoyable. A sight for London when your at the top. ",Christmas suprise
"January 16, 2020",My husband treated me to new year in London and news years day on the eye. What a fabulous experience highly recommend slightly foggy on our day but still amazing views ,Overcrowded
"January 16, 2020","Most probably one of the highest and most amazing wheels in Europe. On a first eye looks stunning and then your desire to fly on is raising up rapidly. Unfortunately, there is a huge queue and with standard ticket in hand you need to wait a lot, so we had not enough time to give it a try. In any case the staff was really friendly and hopefully next we will manage to get on it.",Expensive but a worthwhile treat
"January 15, 2020","We visited at 10.30 am on a sunny, cold Sunday morning. The queue was virtually non-existent, we were greeted by friendly, jovial staff (particularly the security personnel). The ever changing views were impressive with excellent opportunities for photography. This is an attraction that should not be missed.",London Eye
"January 5, 2020","Great view. Glad we did it. Seemed to be a busy with all the NYE travelers, the fast track line was worth it if in your budget. We were on the eye within 15 minutes of buying the tickets. We were their at sunset December 30. Great views. Our pre teen kids loved it.",Amazing Champagne Experience
"January 5, 2020","Myself and my partner arranged for the champagne experience of the London eye and it was totally worth it. Skipped the line, had a photo before going on the eye and had a glass of champagne on the way around. It was amazing along with the views, definitely a romantic activity to do.  Big shout out to Matthew who took charge of our capsule, knew lots about the surrounding sights and gave myself a cork of the champagne bottle for our anniversary",Sunset view
"January 4, 2020","we’ve tried the Linq in Las Vegas but this one is better. it’s about 30-40 minutes ride. we’ve captured the perfect sunset, too bad the big ben is under renovation.",A lot of fun
"January 4, 2020",I went on a school trip some time ago and i really enjoyed it the only downside is that if you go and it is foggy it is really hard to see the city though luckily there was only a bit of fog when i went aswell as it being cloudy though its england so what can you expect.,Champagne Experience
"January 4, 2020","We did the champagne experience on the London eye which I must say is worth the extra price just for having your own personal capsule for your party and the others on the champagne experience! Our host Matthew was very personal and knowledgeable and couldn’t do enough to make our experience fun and enjoyable! A must do activity for a visit to London , we did it during night time and London’s skyline was stunning ",Awesome views
"January 3, 2020",The queue looked scary but moved really quickly. We had clear skies and full sun when we visited so views across London were great. Def a must do!,A must to see and experience 
"January 3, 2020",A great place to get some pics of the London skyline - not to mention just the experience of it all. Pay the extra 10 pounds for fast track service - the efficiency of it all is quick and painless😀 Happy to have done this and be part of THE EYE experience. ,It's wheely good
"January 2, 2020",We booked online with a 3pm time slot. We rushed to make it on time expecting to get on at the specified time. How wrong were we. Got there at 2.45 and were directed to join the queue. 55 minutes later we got on. Obligatory posed photo which was £20 like so many of the attractions. The ride was great with spectacular views.,London from above
"January 1, 2020","Our second time in London on the Eye.  First during the daylight and this time at night!  Gorgeous, comfortable, spacious seating space.  Highly recommend.",It's ok
"January 1, 2020",The London Eye can't be missed. Though there is a long queue with hundreds of tourists. It made us decide not to go in. And it was rather expensive too...,Very crowded but great energy
"December 28, 2019",We saw the queue and decided to skip the giant wheel. But it felt so good to see this whole sea of people around you. The lighting after dark brings in the festive mood. We loved the other rides - 80m high & the merry go round. My kids loved the whole day out. Thank you London!,River and Eye Combo
"December 28, 2019","Recently did the river and London Eye tour, and it was great. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and funny. The actual cruise takes about 40 minutes, and it goes by the Tower of London, City Hall, the oldest waterfront pub in London (the Anchor), among other landmarks. After the cruise, you can go straight to the London Eye. The line to get in the Eye is surprisingly fast (considering how many people are there). The ride takes about 30 minutes, and you get great views of London. I recommend the combination package if you are in London.",Nice to see but overrated
"December 26, 2019","It is nice to see just so you can say you were in London and saw it, but I think it is quite overrated, it is not historical or cultural heritage, and the queues to get on it are ridiculous, especially if you take the price into account as well. It does look good on the pictures though.",Awesome views. 
"December 26, 2019",A truly fantastic experience awaits with unbeatable views of central London and beyond; this probably explains why we have done this a dozen times! Recommended. ,Kid's delight to view the city from the Eye
"December 26, 2019","book in advance to get a shorter wait time. amazing view, grand daughter never wanted to get off of it. better than Disney World per her. ",SO GLAD we did it!
"December 25, 2019","We were only in London about 40 hours, and I'm so glad the London Eye was prioritized for us to do.  Great overview of the city!  Nice clear day and Fast Trax is the way to go!",London eye 
"December 25, 2019",Very beautiful and magical view and you can see London from different sides and enjoy your time there. ,East family activity to see a Fun view of the city
"December 25, 2019",We went with 3 generations Grandparents to grandkids and everyone really enjoyed it.  It was lovely  to see the whole city from up high and it went slow enough that we really had a chance to take it all in.  Also some fun photo ops.,Arrive early to get on board quickly
"December 25, 2019","This is a pricey tourist attraction and has long lines starting mid morning, but I suppose it's worth it to do once.  I would not take the time if you are only in London for a day or two though.  On the other hand you do get great views of London for photos.  So it's really a personal choice.  We were glad we did it but looking back on our trip we would not have missed it had we skipped it.",One time was enough
"December 24, 2019","I always wanted to go up in the London eye, so I made sure to add it to the itinerary when planning my London trip. I purchased the fast track ticket and highly recommend this. The views were great and I’m glad I experienced the London eye, but it’s definitely something you only need to do once. The next time I go to London I don’t need to go up in the eye again. The only reason I marked the London eye down was because my sister and I missed our initial time to use our ticket. We were over in Greenwich at the Royal Observatory and our water Taxi got us to the Eye late. We missed the opening hours by 5 minutes and we were told we couldn’t board any longer. I explained that we couldn’t go the next day because we had arrangements to go out of the city to Bath. The employee told us to comeback whenever we could to exchange the ticket and to tell them our story of why we missed our date. We ended up returning two days later and had to go inside to the ticket sales counter and exchange for a new ticket. It cost £5 each to exchange which I guess is better than having to pay full price again, but I mean it would have been nice to not have to pay. ",50 pounds pp
"December 15, 2019",The place is beautiful but don't pay such a crazy amount to have a ride! Spend those money to have a great drink with your friends in one of the many bars and restaurants close to it and with an amazing view,Great ride
"December 15, 2019","The experience and views are well worth the ticket price. I do recommend getting the fast track option, saves a lot of time. ",Awesome view
"December 12, 2019","It is one of prime attractions in London! We were fortunate enough because we went during off peak season and the waiting queues were not long. Comes with a nice complimentary 4D short movie experience!! The view from the top was pretty amazing except that it was raining , so far off structures were covered in haze. Nevertheless, enjoyed a lot!",Magic
"December 12, 2019","I'm terrified of heights.   But when your grandchildren want to go up,  what do you do? You go up with them!  It's fantastic.  The views... incredible.  I'll go again anytime ! ",London Eye via Fast Track
"December 10, 2019","I bought my fast track tickets as I was not in the mood to wait in the que. The ride was awesome, you did not know you were moving. Once on top the view is great, you can see so far.",Absolutey fabulous
"December 10, 2019",Fast track ticket was a hit. We literaly just walked in. Ride was awsome. U really do not have a feeling that u r spinning. View  is remarcable. Definitely u have to do it but after u ve seen the city around and than go up to admire those sightseens!,Amazing Experience 
"December 9, 2019",This was certainly an amazing experience watching entire London from the top. ... this is must visit and a life time experience. ,Το London Eye
"December 9, 2019",Το London Eye is the best way to see the entire London from above and also in a very cheap way!!!!!!,My son loved it
"December 9, 2019","First time with 5 month old, 4 and 6 year olds and they loved it. We were lucky and didn't have to queue but the staff were pretty stroppy about the pram which was the only down side.  We have Merlin passes so I can't comment on value for money but the views are amazing and the ride just long enough to not get bored.  We had a fab time ",Amazing view
"December 8, 2019",Great view of the whole city. I went there at sunset and it really was magical seeing all the lights around.,Beautiful view but pricey
"December 5, 2019","The location is very nice, close to the big Ben and the parliament. The view is fantastic. The duration is just right.The price is quite high though...",London Eye Top!
"December 4, 2019",Its a must if you go to visit London and you want to have a sky look over the city and the river. I really suggest to buy the ticket via web in orser to skyp the line. The best time is the sunset.. they provid also vip package.,Great views of london... on a clear day
"December 3, 2019","Great views of london, however we went at dusk on a cloudly day and it left you a little disappointed. I would go again either earlier in the day or at dark so you can see the lights of london.",I recommend it for you 
"December 3, 2019","I visit London often, but this my first time to be in the London eye and it was a great acceptable waiting time and good staff. ",Brilliant view of the city
"December 2, 2019",We rode once during the day and once at night so we could take in the views with and without the city lights.  The views are amazing up and down the Thames.  My only complaint would be that the allow too many people into each carriage which makes it difficult for everyone to see all the views - especially if you are short like I am.  But I would definitely recommend the ride - both day and night.,Great experience but now too expensive
"December 2, 2019","This is on the must do list for most visitors, but now that the price has multiplied over the years I'm not sure it's worth it anymore for an experience less than an hour.  If the Sky Garden is open I've heard it's as good or better.  ",Wonderful 
"December 2, 2019","Wonderful experience, not a very big que at 10am so was on the ride within 10 minutes. Staff were all friendly, ",There are other cheaper ways to see the city from up high
"December 1, 2019","We did this because one of the children insisted this was a bucket list item. It’s a novelty, a giant slow Ferris wheel that takes thirty minutes to do a full rotation giving you ample time to enjoy the view. I agree with another reviewer who suggested some audio in each capsule to tell you what you’re looking at. The views are pretty amazing, especially near sunset, however, you can go to the sky garden for free and see a view of the city from up high and save yourself $50 per person for a fast track ticket. In my opinion, this wasn’t worth the cost and we wouldn’t do it again.",A must do London experience
"December 1, 2019","Absolutely love this, and have done it multiple times with visiting friends and family. A great way to see London from above",Nice experience
"December 1, 2019","Last time I was in London we skipped this, bur this time me and mu friend took the ride and it was a very nice experience and awesome view from the top",Somewhat enjoyable but overrated!
"November 11, 2019",The London Eye is too expensive for the short ride! We kept getting pushed and shoved by other people and it wasn't the most enjoyable of experiences. Glad we have ticked it off our bucket list but will not be visiting again.,Overrated tourist-trap
"November 10, 2019","Far too expensive for a view over Big Ben.Had expected to see more of London, like Towerbridge. On the plusside it wasnt scary for someone that doesnt like heights",Fun View of The City
"November 10, 2019","I'm not usually into ferris wheels but this moves slow and doesn't feel too high (even though it does go quite far up). Was able to get some great pics and the bubble we were in was air conditioned for summer. Probably about 15 of us in one bubble, you can stand or there was a bench to sit on. It was a fun experience and would do it again!",Tourist must do
"November 9, 2019","Very touristy. But still a must do when in London...at least once.  Wait can be a bit long, but you are able to get a car with just your group without being crowded in with strangers.","Lovely view, experience "
"November 9, 2019","Was in London for my first (GASP) time ever. Visiting my niece, and had done the big bus tour, a lot of walking and really wanted to do the eye... so we didIt was a rainy gray day, and we got tix for the 4:15 time slot. Was concerned it would be dreary and dull. Was absolutely wrong. The 30 minute ride provided quite the unique view of London, and the rainy gray complemented it nicely. I got the fast track tix bc we had multiple people and were running all over London all day. They were definitely worth it. However the folks in the standard ticket line moved along very efficiently as well.  Would do again, especially if I could do it in a clear day around sunset",Good eagle’s eye views
"November 8, 2019",This was my third time on the Eye and on a very clear day. The views were good and give you an overview perspective. Bring a map or buy their brochure to get a better idea of what you’re seeing.I felt rushed getting in and off and a little unstable. Staff could be more aware that some people might appreciate a guiding hand. ,Great Attraction for Kids
"November 7, 2019","Our family absolutely loved the Eye of London. I was a little concerned with the price, as it is fairly expensive for a family of five, bit was not disappointed. Would definitely recommend this to other families. The views are outstanding. ",Be Quick
"November 7, 2019",Gives you a great view of the city. It rotates slowly so that you do not feel rushed and can take great photos!!,London
"November 7, 2019","We love the London eye on a clear day is magnificent you can see from afar it moves slow and you get to experience the beautiful buildings  in all there glory we went in the regular Que which was fine as it wasn't to busy the children loved it ,its a must do when your in London ,when we came off we walked along the River Thames lots of activity going on along the Thames with rides street food  boat trips its buzzing",Short ride with ok views 
"November 6, 2019","The ride was good but the views were obstructed with very little direction where to look.  Also,  on a rainy London day it is hard to see through the glass.A must do while in London but don’t hold your breath to be amazed",Buy your ticket from the Hop-on Hop-off bus driver!
"November 2, 2019","When we recently visited London we wanted to ride the Eye, but the hotel concierge said there were no ticket reservation times available until later in the day when rain was forecast. We then went to ride the Hop-on Hop-off bus and the ticket agent said we could buy ""skip the line"" Eye tickets from him and we could ride anytime (even right then) without waiting in line. I was skeptical, but we purchased the tickets and immediately went to the Eye and it worked! We skipped the long, long, long line and rode before it rained! Buy your tickets when you buy your hoho bus tickets.",Jack was a winner! 
"November 1, 2019","We’ve been travelling for 6 weeks - 10 countries planes, trains etc my -  14 yr old is museumed, and castled out and exhausted. Dragged him out of bed for a midday boat tour London eye and arvo walking on the South bank.  Well thanks to Jack - the Ginger ninja he perked up - had a laugh, engaged and enjoyed it.  This is such a great way to get yr bearings in a new city and Jack entertained with a very amusing commentary as we plodded along the Thames - loved the story about marriage proposals that went awfully wrong on the eye-  We then did the London eye with a short queue - again you see so much from that height and it moves at a nice pace for photos and taking in the view.  Finally headed into the 4d theatre ( free with the ticket) which was actually surprisingly very good and set off on foot with the confidence of landmarks from the two tours and finished with street food on the South bank. Great afternoon out on a drizzly, grey London day!  ",Pity about the clouds
"November 1, 2019",Really quick and easy process. Great views over London. Plenty space in capsule. Nice amount of time to enjoy views ,Do it once anyway!
"November 1, 2019",The purchased tickets for the fast track in advance - which I suggest you do if you want to take in this attraction - otherwise the queue is LONG!  We also had a glass of champagne afterwards (or you can do it before) in the VIP lounge across the way.  The ride up is slow and sometimes you cannot even tell you are moving.  It wasn't very crowded inside so you could easily move about and check out the view from every angle.  It did get a bit boring just watching everyone take selfies and pictures of each other the entire time.  We did get a few good shots - and the attraction takes some photos of you too that you can purchase afterwards.  It was a novelty and we are glad we did it - but I still think the best view of London is absolutely from the Shard.,OK but not wonderful
"October 31, 2019","We got there at 10:00 on a Sunday morning and were able to get book a 10:30 trip. We entered the pod with a minimum amount of queueing  and it was not too full.The trip itself was something of an anticlimax , while you could see many of the sights around London and well beyond if the skies are clear and not too cloudy, the lack of any sort of guidance via and audio guide or  maps meant it was not always obvious what to look for. The 30 minute duration of the trip is just about right as we were all happy enough to leave after half an hour in the pod.Our trip was part of a combined ticket with the Sea Life Centre and Madame Tussauds so it was not too expensive.All in in it was an ok experience rather than a wonderful one,  we all enjoyed the view from the Shard far more when we did that last year as it seemed far more of an event.",Go for the 2FOR1 tickets
"October 31, 2019","Go up at dusk for a night view of London's skyline. No queue on a Friday night either. We walked straight in. A 20 mins or so ride, only worth it if you got a 2FOR1 ticket, available on the Days Out Guide if you travel by trains into London.",Great view!
"October 31, 2019","The London Eye was a pleasant experience. I bought Fast Track which reduced the queues from 3 hours to about 10 minutes.  Once up there it was a nice view of London, all the views gave me a perspective on what it may have looked like in the past and what it looks like now.  With a fast track purchased I feel that it was fun and affordable. If I would not had bought the fast track it would probably have been horrible!  Recommend everyone to do this once, you have done it before maybe it is not very fun!  Everything was fine except the unpleasant staff who scanned the tickets without saying hello or even checking up.",Amazing view of London

"October 29, 2019",We took a spin on the Eye on our first day in London.  We lucked out with no rain and only partly cloudy weather.  We thought it was great to get a sense for how the city is laid out. Views were fantastic. ,Beautiful 
"November 5, 2019","The London eye offers an amazing view of London. You can see everything from the top, it's a beautiful sight. ",A Must Do
"November 5, 2019",This is a must do activity but highly recommend you prebook to avoid the queues. Or go early. Combo tickets save time and money if you are planning to do other stuff. We did the Aquarium and London Dungeons. No need to do all on same day but you certainly could as each place only required a couple of hours. Look for deals on chocolate bars and cereal boxes to save money. Not worth it on a rainy day so check weather forecast.,Better than it looks.
"November 4, 2019",My son begged me to go there so I bought him.It was actually a very good experience. The cabin is very big and air conditioned. It lasted around 30 mins and we could see the whole of London. Both my son and myself enjoyed so much!,Champagne Experience 
"November 4, 2019","I purchased tickets for the champagne experience and then paid a bit extra for an additional drink while waiting in the lounge. I suggest paying extra so you’re able to wait in the lounge as opposed to the disorderly lounge outside. ‪A 6:00pm‬ ride was perfect as the sun was just beginning to set. The host was the best and entertaining throughout. The quality of the champagne wasn’t the best in my opinion, but I drunk it since it was paid for. The ride seemed super short. I believe it’s advertised as 30 minutes long…no way! Either way, it was a good experience and I’m glad I did it.",Worth while
"November 4, 2019",This is an amazing experience unfortunately the day we did go on was foggy and raining so didn’t experience the full views. But still the experience is good and the 4d cinema is really good.,The best view and ride!

"November 3, 2019","The London eye, River Thames cruise and 4D experience are wonderful experiences in London.  Fast track access is appreciated so that you don't need to wait in the queue.  The guide in the open roof motor boat gave excellent introduction to buildings and infrastructure around as the boat approached each structure including the famous London bridge.",A window cleaner might be nice.
"November 3, 2019","For the money you pay, you would expect at the very least, clean windows?! Every photo ruined by dirty windows and then poor visibility. Total waste of money. Better to go to the Shard where there's less queuing and less tourist rip.",One of a kind eye in the sky

It doesn't move too fast, allowing us to get great pictures. We opted to not buy ""skip the line"" tickets but the line moved really fast. ",Well worth doing
"October 13, 2019","The London Eye is clearly a must do attraction. We went on a clear morning and bought a ticket which allowed timed entry so that we didn’t have to stand in a queue for very long. While we had great views of Westminster Bridge and the Houses of Parliament, there was a group of tourists who were very loud and not very considerate of others in that they hogged the views a bit.","Wet, miserable, not inspiring."
"October 13, 2019","Visited with family who booked this as a treat for me during my London trip. Tickets were pre booked which reduced the queue time to around 20 minutes.  There was a good view of the capital in spite of the weather but it didn't have that wow factor. The trip lasted around 30 minutes. Not sure how much the tickets were, but I was not over impressed. I could have found a similar view from a roof top restaurant in the city & enjoyed it much more. Alternatively a cruise up the Thames would have been more enjoyable & just as informative. It's a novelty strictly for tourists...",Good
"October 13, 2019",Need to work on waiting time .. rest all is good. Gives a good view of whole of london. Must do activity in london,Very good
"October 13, 2019","I won’t make this a long review!I visited as part of a 5 strong family group. The ride was clean, easy to get on and gave fantastic views over London.We were lucky as it was dry and clear when we went. If you have a dry day I would definitely recommend this attraction. I was lucky to find a 2 for 1 offer on the tickets, otherwise I would say it’s a little pricey, but a must do if visiting London. Also, the 4D cinema included in the ticket is well worth doing. ",Fantastic!
"October 12, 2019","The London Eye is great! They keep it nice and tidey. If you are on a schedule like we were, definitely invest in the Fast Track. It was well worth it. We really enjoyed the sights and the Eye itself. ",Not the easiest ticket to ride!!
"October 12, 2019","Booked for 3 of us on the London Eye today. We had a visitor from Australia with us so wanted to impress. The journey in the pod was good once you were on the eye. Getting  onto it is another matter! I booked their standard tickets with a known boarding time of 15.30. We arrived early and realised that the time you are allocated is meaningless when it’s busy. (It was busy!). You just have to join the back of the queue and snake around for 45 minutes before you reach the front.  So if you plan to go on this ride, book a fast track ticket which costs more and lets you jump the queue. Otherwise be prepared to wait and wait and wait!.....",Greta Sunset Ride
"October 12, 2019","We arrived in London late in the day on a Saturday.  We were staying at the nearby Park Plaza (walking distance).  We wanted to ride the Eye, but couldn't be certain our flight would arrive at the scheduled time.  So we splurged in advance and bought Flexi Fast Track tickets online.  These tickets allow you to get in the Fast Track queue at any time during the designated day.  Shortly after we settled in at our hotel, we went out to eat confident that our place in the queue was waiting for us.  When we arrived at the Eye, the queues to buy tickets and to board with standard admission were very long.  However, the Fast Track queue was minuscule by comparison.  We waited maybe 10 minutes. What a great ride.  The sky was clear, and the setting sun was beautiful.  The views in every direction were fabulous.  We were glad we extra for Flexi.",SKY HIGH
"October 12, 2019",This is a wonderful ride lasting about one half hour.  You see epic views of London.  Hop on hop off as the wheel turns.  You need to do this.,Fun but iberpriced
"September 25, 2019","Always book ahead, if you arrive late you won’t be let on.  The views are great and the service is reasonable... but if you have slow moving people in from of you it makes you anxious that you won’t get in/out in time.",Great view

"September 24, 2019","We'd booked online but joined the standard queue as we didn't pay the extra for fast track. Initially the queue looked quite lengthy but it moved well (they load up to 28 people in each capsule) and we were on within about 30 minutes.The pods have a reasonable amount of space so it is possible to move around. The movement is smooth and not at all scary - unless you are seriously scared of heights. Obviously the view does depend a little on the weather conditions, but on a good day you do get the opportunity to see most of the main London landmarks.Make sure you do the (free) 4D experience too - it is tucked away in the same building as the ticket office. It is not earth shattering, but it is a nice intro.Be warned though, this is a Merlin attraction so they will take your photos at various opportunities to sell to you later on. But they don't put any pressure on you and you can choose not to have your photo taken.",Daddy daughter day 6yrs old 
"September 24, 2019",This is definitely something you have to do when in london The 1st impression is wow it's a huge wheel and it looks scary and I'm not 1 for heights but when you get into the capsule type of cabin its class very safe and the funny part is and yes hard to believe its moving all the time the cabin doesn't move only the wheel which is class my 6yr daughter was very scared at 1st but after a few mins she was like me relaxed as u wouldn't know your moving ,Tim B
"September 23, 2019",My wife and I just did the London Eye a couple days ago. It has the most spectacular views of London. After walking around for 4 days seeing all the sights we went up in the London Eye and saw everything from up top it was so cool too see. You can move around and take all sorts of pictures. It is amazing how much you can see. You are also invited for free to watch a 4D movie about the London Eye. Very fun I highly recommend it if you are going to London don’t miss it. ,Can’t pick your fellow travellers on the capsule 
"September 23, 2019",Went on the London Eye with the family. It was Ok - nothing to get too excited over. We were in a capsule with rowdy German men who thought they were the only ones in the capsule. They hogged the prime viewing spots and were loud and making jokes amongst themselves. Was pleased when we were able to get off...,wonderful visit
"September 23, 2019","For a long time the family plans to visit  the London Eye, We did’t this time.It was a wonderful experience  very lovely scenery and on a Sunday it was not crowded and smooth walk in.The area around the Eye is full of entertainment and it i great for children.",Brilliant experience 
"September 23, 2019","Well organised, friendly cheerful staff and views to die for! Our trip was on an amazing clear sunny day which made it even better but definitely an experience not to be missed x",Coca-Cola London eye 
"September 22, 2019","It is always good place to visit , area is so happening , all age people can enjoy , london eye is good place to visit once if you are visiting london but not twice . If u r visiting first time . Must go place ",Birthday visit
"September 20, 2019",The line looked very long but it moved effectively. We were not too crowded in our pod. Spacious with central seating. Amazing views but at 5pm sunny / glare over Westminster Abbey. ,Amazing 
"September 20, 2019","We prebooked the champagne experience, I have to say it was amazing, we started off in the vip lounge and went straight on to the eye, Jenifer was our tour guide she was excellent, and very informative, she also took some excellent photos which I’ll treasure for ever ",Lots to do
"September 20, 2019",This was the highlight of my entire trip.  My partner and I waited until the very last day to go there.  The weather was nice in London which meant there were more people out.  It's great to go earlier as the lines are quite long.  ,The Queue was long but was worth the wait.
"September 20, 2019","A trip to London includes many ""must-see"" attractions and the ""eye"" is certainly in the top ten!! This is a memorable experience no matter your age, background or interests. From the moment you catch a glimpse of the magnificent wheel, your anticipation rises as you approach. Check-in and boarding are efficient because the wheel never stops! It continues to move at a very slow pace as riders continually embark and disembark. The entire ""ride"" takes less than 30 minutes. The views at the top of the wheel (at over 135 meters) are nearly beyond description, as you are gazing 360 degrees from a vantage point directly above the Thames River, Big Ben, Houses of Parliament and the Ministry of Defence.",The Views Over London Make For A Great Experience
"September 19, 2019",A fun experience with 30 minute rotation allowing one to see London from all points of the compass. The movie included is a very entertaining intro to the Eye.,Fun ride
"September 19, 2019",We rode the Eye one evening. We had the fast track tickets and literally walked on immediately. We got our tickets online which made getting very easy. It’s a 30 min ride. We did it at sunset. Beautiful view of London and the Thames.,Wow
"September 19, 2019",Bought tickets so we didn’t have to que. pleased we did! Overall great experience have to do it at least once while your there. ,Worth Going!
"September 19, 2019","London eye was fun. I took fast track ticket, which made the experience easy and fast. The normal line was way too long. I would suggest to go for fast track to save on time and long queue. The giant wheel takes about 30 minutes to complete a round and is very slow so you can click photos. The Pod doesn’t stop while entering or leaving so be mindful. They are spacious and not crowded. There is place to sit, can walk around and comfortably have a look at the London skyline. You get to see Big Ben,  House of Parliament, tower bridge Buckingham Palace, Of course Thames river and few more. In total worth going. Staffing is good. There is also 4d show which is included in the ticket so you don’t have to pay extra. Also there’s a park close by. Kids will love it. Uploading few pics. ",Worth it
"September 18, 2019",The views you get from here are just awesome. Flexi pass is worth it. We didn’t have to wait in line at all. ,Well worth doing the cruise and London eye!
"September 18, 2019","We weren't sure about doing a cruise, but our tour guide was very knowledgeable about all the main attractions you're able to see along the river without being too long of a cruise. We were able to skip the lines and go straight to entering the London eye after our cruise was over. Highly recommend!",Beateful view of London
"September 17, 2019",I went to the London eye in the morning and the weather was good so i had the opportunity to see the city clearly from above and had a nice experience.,London eye 
"September 16, 2019",I recently visited London whilst on holidays soWe were doing all of the tourist things Seeing all of the attractions and monumentsThe London eye being one of themThis was a great way to have a look around while enjoying a bit of a break We didn’t have to line up for long and the capsule was quite roomy so not crowded The Eye is a little expensive But in my case I might only ever be there once so well worth the ride,Worth seeing
"September 15, 2019","Was a great experience, booked online with fast track and was worth it all the way through. Skip long queues and hassles. Finished off with glass of xhampagne in the bar on the 1st floor.",Amazing
"September 15, 2019","We opted for the fast track plus champagne. $14 more than the reg price.  We waited in a lovely bar/lounge area before boarding, only one other couple was in our pod along with a tour host.  She poured our glass of champagne and then when we reached the top point she explained all the landmarks around us and offered to take any pictures with our phones we wanted.  It was a very pleasant uncrowded half hour ride.  Well worth the extra money.",Fantastic!! 
"September 15, 2019","We were on a theatre break in London and decided to do some sightseeing. We were amazed by the sights on the London Eye. We booked our tickets on the website the night before which was incredibly simple. I was concerned with the length of the queue upon arrival but it was quick to go down and was constantly moving. We combined with the London Eye River Cruise. We paid £33pp which I felt was great value for money. It was a fabulous experience on the cruise. Jeannie was our commentary guide. She was very comical and made the trip very enjoyable yet informative. I would love to go on the London Eye again we were so lucky with the weather, we could see for miles and miles. ",Great experience
"September 15, 2019",Well organised tourist attraction. Great views. Good way to get an overview of some of the main London landmarks,Great view
"September 15, 2019",We took the last possible trip at 9:30 pm to see the London at night from the sky . Its beautiful and we took the fast lane to skip the crowd . Its on the expensive side - however worth the money.The commercial part of it - selling you photos before and after in the london eye sometime can be annoyong however its a ritual everywhere you go. Recommended visit for all - though its NOT cheap we enjoyed thoroughly,Anniversary trip 
"September 15, 2019","Great way to get a beautiful view of London, it runs til around 9:30 sunset photos would be amazing . Get the fast track ticket it’ll save you from the long lines .",Great view
"September 15, 2019","Best go on a clear day. We took lots of pictures. Shame Big Ben was covered with scaffolding though. If you have a disabled person in your party, you don’t have to spend hours in a queue. They take you fast track.",Beautiful 360 view
"September 15, 2019",Amazing view up there in a clear blue sky. Ground staffs are extremely friendly and helpful while the 4D experience is amazing,Gorgeous views
"September 6, 2019",This was such a brilliant experience for me and my girls. The weather was sunny and warm and the capsule was not crowded at all so we were able to take some nice photos without having to ask people to move. The views were sensational! ,Dated concept and uninteresting ride
"September 5, 2019","The 4D experience is really outdated - using the 3D glasses is passé and the film is evidently made many years back. It does not serve any purpose in enhancing the London Eye ride or enhancing visitors’ understanding of London. The management should learn from other cities such as Amsterdam’s ‘This is Holland’ 5D experience. That is something to beat. The ride on the Eye itself was marred by the fact there is not much of a view up there. The river Thames is full of construction sites and therefore after 10 minutes, the ride felt too long as it became boring since there was not much scenery to admire. Need to revitalise the entire experience to save it from being forsaken in this day and age. ",Jolly Good Vantage Point
"September 5, 2019",This is an absolutely splendid vantage point for anyone about to set sail on an expedition. You can see far into the distance with a telescope. I had to give it four stars because I saw no sea monsters from the summit of this amazing contraption!,A good way to view the city
"September 5, 2019","This is one of the best ways to have a bird’s eye view of London. For about 30mins, you have a 360 degree view of the city. The best part is the 3D short video at the end of the ride. You will love this experience. It is also very close to the Dungeons. The queues are long so be prepared to wait. It is best to buy your ticket online to avoid queuing up for the ticket and then for the ride itself.",Stunning
"September 4, 2019","Amazing ride, once is not enough. atleast you need 2 rides if you really want to view everything. and try for fast track for sure",Go express pass.
"September 4, 2019","Go for the express pass and enjoy a view with little or no queue, London as I have never seen it. BT tower Buckingham palace, Westminster, The Barbican etc. etc.",super experience
"September 4, 2019","the ondon eye experience was super. i already book the ticket online so i didnt have to waste the time standing in the long rows for buying tickets, all staff was really nice from security to gift shop all is good. for river cruise, the guide was so clever and gave us her best to enjoy london main attractions. the security of the cruise was very rude, extremly rude, he came from far away shouting to make the line properly i just got surprised how he is allowed to do that in london which is one of the main capitals in the world in rules and respecting individuals. he is the only one who annoyed my visit that day and thanks GOD that the guide let me forget him","Very touristy, but worth it to see once"
"September 4, 2019","Don't get me wrong this is a complete tourist trap - very expensive fast pass tickets, having to take the obligatory photo with the green background before you can even go on and then people queuing for them after. We purchased fast track which was very quick and definitely worth it, but once inside the capsule it was a fight for a view. People seemed more interested in selfies than actually looking at the London skyline. Good for people visiting London and passes half an hour but not worth the cost.",Relax and enjoy the view
"September 3, 2019",This attraction was one of four that we purchased together. Although the line up was long it went quite quickly. The children enjoyed being up so high but I am not keen on heights so it was a challenge. The view of the Thames was nice but is was a little pricey for what you got as it didn’t take long to go full circle.,Happy Birthday Tea with champagne 
"September 3, 2019","Magnificent location for an elegant tea. Stunning decor, excellent food, impeccable service, beautiful piano music in the background. What a treat my daughter gave me for my birthday!",Such a fun experience
"September 10, 2019","Lovely calm quiet ride giving you exceptional views of London, Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, The Shard, Buckingham Palace, The Tower and obviously the Thames River to name a few. The ride runs very slowly so you can really take in all the views. We fast tracked the line so the wait wasn't bad at all. Maybe 5 minutes.",The view is amazing 
"September 10, 2019",I bought the ticket  with  5 attractions one of those was the eye.You can book a hour to comeThe ticket with that pass is much more chipper than if you buy it alone The ride is about 30 minutes total once you get on the weal,Loved the London Eye!
"September 10, 2019","We purchased tickets for about sunset and it was wonderful!  Very small line, walk up  and enter! It's a very smooth slow ride that gives you views that are amazing.Well worth doing while in London!",Great fun and beautiful views!
"September 9, 2019","This has been a bucket list item for quite some time.  It lived up to my expectations. Beautiful views of London -- and it was terrific to not have to wait in long lines, with the advance purchase of our tickets.",Wonderful view
"September 9, 2019",My teenage son and I are afraid of heights and we both managed to get up enough courage to go on it with my 5 year old and husband.  It has a great view of the city on the waterfront and even some on the horizon. I would do it again!!!,Nice for tourists! 
"September 9, 2019",The place are very clouded with tourists and you must be careful of the picked pockets but it is the place you should come if you come to U.K. for first time !,Amazing views
"September 9, 2019",Amazing views from the top of the London eye. Only downside was the length of the queue. We waited until half 8 in the evening and at that we queued for an hour but was worth the wait!,Annual vacation 
"September 9, 2019",We did not actually get on the ride. It is one of the largest of its kind in the world. It was a cool night and there was still a line of people waiting to get on. ,Nice
"September 8, 2019",Nice to be on the ride. I thought I had a skip the line ticket but I actually had a regular ticket. The regular line didn’t take long though. Very nice. ,Best view in town!
"September 7, 2019","My husband and I were looking forward to going on this attraction and weren't disappointed.  The views were incredible and could be seen from all angles.  You are free to walk around the pod and there are seats if you wish to sit down.  Even though you are in the pod for about half an hour in total, it seemed to go by a lot quicker.  I took  a lot of photos of all that I saw.  We visited London at a very busy time so there was a big queue.  However, it didn't take long for it to move and was worth the wait.",A fantastic way to see it all!
"August 28, 2019","After 14 days of touring London and Scotland, 4 of us had tickets for the London Eye.  I would suggest doing it at the very beginning or end of a trip.  In the beginning, you'll be able to see the proximity of attractions and make an itinerary (much quicker if using the underground).  At the end of the trip as we did, it reminded me of all of the places we visited.  It also was such a great mix of the old architecture right up against the new.  Our tickets were for noon, but we realized they weren't paying attention to the time and we were able to board early.  Made for a great experience!",Nice but a waste of time.
"August 27, 2019","Granddaughter wanted to see it.  The area is so overcrowded. Purchased tickets home still had to wait on a massive line to get on. You do have great views of the city, but it’s so time consuming.  It’s up to you this is my opinion.",Highlight of London
"August 27, 2019",We knew we had to do this excursion because it is so popular but we dreaded the crowds. We needn’t have worried... we arrived early in the morning and the queue moved really fast!  The sights were incredible and it is well worth a visit ,Forget the EYE; Take the Cruise
"August 27, 2019","Wife and I went on the river cruise first, much fun, very informative and funny host. We got a perspective from the river that we never would have gotten from land. We talked with many who had taken the London EYE before the cruise, and to a person they recommended that we save our money and avoid the EYE. Apparently the EYE is slow, crowded, and sometimes breaks down and stops. We were more than satisfied with the cruise.",Waste of time
"August 27, 2019","Crowded car, you don’t see anything that special and the fast pass price is too high. Utter waste of money.",Great Trip
"August 27, 2019","I took my 5 year old for her first visit to London to meet my friend's. Our Eye time was 12.45 but was informed could queue up to 30 minutes prior to this which we did. When we went the queue was split so that person's not queuing can cross through the centre. To be fair though the queue was very quick. It takes 30 minutes to go round and the views really are breathtaking. Most people congregate at the front of the pod with great views to the left of Big Ben, Parliament etc. At the end of the flight you can have your photo taken on the right hand side both front and back as you go round. It is very much worth a visit especially if you do the Southbank at the same time. As a bonus I used my Tesco clubcard vouchers that I'd saved so didn't cost me anything. A brilliant memory for both my daughter and I!",Don't miss out
"August 27, 2019","If you are in London, you must go on the Eye. Make sure it's not a foggy day though, obviously. What looks a long queue moves very quickly so not much hanging about, easy to board and they take pictures, inside and out of the capsule. Last about 20 minutes, (didn't actually time it). and seems well worth the money to me.","A great, quick way to enjoy the sights of London"
"August 26, 2019","We did the ‘no wait’ pass and they meant it!! We walked right up and were whisked away a separate lane for express users.  About a minute later we were on our way to the top! Even on a rainy, cloudy day you could see most of London without any issue. Other passengers were cool (mostly) about moving around so you could see multiple vantage points.",I love the London eye!
"August 26, 2019",I went to it and I loved it! Great weather and beautiful view. I was in London for 5 days and one of the days I went to there. I went with my family and it was awesome!,Not for people with anxiety/fear of heights.
"August 26, 2019","I don't want to give this attraction low stars because I have anxiety and it might be great for regular people.  I literally started having a panic attack after I realized that I would be locked in that capsule with 20 strangers for 30 minutes, then my fear of heights kicked in.  I literally sat down and proceeded to hyperventilate and sweat from every crack in my body.  My friend I was with was clueless and chatting up other people and taking photos lol.  The only thing that saved me was a young girl from Chicago started talking to me and I just tried to focus on her and converse.",Worth the $$ to skip the line
"August 21, 2019","The views are amazing, but I would pay extra to skip the line. You can buy a regular ticket and then upon arriving, if the line is long, you can upgrade to skip the line. Don't forget the 4D show beforehand!",Breath taking view
"August 21, 2019","A great view of the city. You are really high in the air. On a nice clear day you can see so far and pick out the different sights from a birds eye view. The pods holds about 10- 15 people and you can sit or stand. The pod moves very slow, so you will not get sick from going too fast. We went during the day, but I bet it would be stunning at night with all the nightlights.",Family trip 
"August 21, 2019","Excellent time, booked a viewing time, got in the queue 30 mins before and was on the Eye at the right time scheduled. The staff are very friendly and organised. ",Fabulous Engineering 
"August 21, 2019",Buy the skip the line tickets - they do work in London!  Very busy area but it is an amazing view! The ride is about 30 minutes.,Fun Rain or Shine!
"August 21, 2019",A must!  Amazing views! Entire family enjoyed it.  It goes so smooth you do not realize it moves.  Large space so you do not feel claustrophobic.,Don’t book through discount London
"August 21, 2019","This is a very enjoyable way to see the city. However, discount London messed up the paperwork and had 5 children under were 10 left without a ticket and very disappointed. Book direct, don’t trust 3rd party pirates. In the end I spent another 150 on tickets....... which leads me to another complaint, why would you not have discounts for groups of kids? 150 is extortionate, especially when you cram so many into the small space. Anyway, nice but dont book through discount London.... shambolic company","Nice views from London, but overrated "
"August 20, 2019","The views from the London Eye are very nice, no doubt, but in my opinion, this attraction is overrated. London has so many other attractions that are more interesting than this one. If you don’t have much time in London, I would skip this attraction.",The Dirty Windows on the London Eye
"August 20, 2019","Windows were dirty ruined pictures you try to take , don’t recommend for the price tbh they should at least clean the windows for everyone to have a good experience . Nobody wants a nice view looking bad because the windows are dirty.",Get there early
"August 20, 2019","To avoid long queues, pre book and / or get there very early. Do not sit in the middle or everyone will be in the way of a great view of the sights.",Worth it even in the rain
"August 20, 2019","This has become one of those ""must-do"" things in London. We didn't bother with the fast tickets, and our line was just as fast. You get 30 minutes of great views of the city near Parliament.",A must do! 
"August 7, 2019","Booked tickets online for a time slot (12:30). we got there and was told that we just had to queue which was about an hour long. The time slots don’t really matter. We paid £10 to upgrade to a fasttrack slot which was at 3pm, but as my boyfriend bought his ticket a 1:45 slot became available so we changed. We could queue from 1:15 and we were up in the air by 1:30. I’d recommend buying the fastrack as it saves a lot of time. Well organised and it offers student tickets too! ",London's iconic view point
"August 10, 2019",Do not do this if you are scared of heights. I was terrified. My family on the other hand enjoyed the whole experience and took lots of fab pictures.The queuing system is chaotic but moved surprisingly quickly. All staff were friendly and approachable.,Boat unavailable
"August 10, 2019","I had planned a day trip from Paris to London. I had purchased my tickets in advance to tour the Thames.  When we arrived at the dock, the coordinator stated the London eye river cruise boat is not service. Boo! So I had to actually purchase city cruise at the ticket booth. They could’ve just honored my reservation without me having to buy another ticket. Anyways let’s see if I get a refund for the original tour. The city cruise was funny and entertaining.",Great views
"August 10, 2019",Spectacular views.   Big Ben was covered in scaffolding so we opted for the photo they do.  Was a little overcast for a summers day and rained but overall the experience was great.  Recommend you go on The London eye if you haven’t yet.  We did- tick- off the bucket list.,Wonderful!
"August 10, 2019","What a view you get from the top! Not for the faint hearted and definitely not for anyone who has vertigo! Went round slowly so you get a great view of London. VERY helpful for my disabled husband to get on and off. Thanks to the staff for that. Chatty staff too, who said ""have a nice rest of the day"" to us.",Best time!!
"August 9, 2019",My 14 yr old teenager granddaughter and I visited LONDON after a prolonged wait. Airline delays and all that goes along with that. We missed our day for the purchased VIP tickets which were non refundable. I thought I have nothing to loose and called them up to explain. I have only nice things to say about the curtesy and accommodating young girl who waived all of that and let us go the next day!! Needless to say we had a grand time and enjoyed our time in the sky tremendously!! Recommend it highly!! Enjoy!!,London Eye - Fast Track Ticket
"August 9, 2019","My wife and I booked our visited on the London Eye in mid July 2019 on a weekday through ‘Golden Tours’. We had used this company before with the ‘Jump on/off Bus Tour’ and they gave us a heavily discounted price on a Fast Track Ticket which worked out just £3 more than a standard ticket! We booked in for 11:30am and basically walked straight on. There were 10 people in our air-conditioned cabin with the whole trip taking about 30 minutes. Amazing views, we loved it!!It was totally worth paying that extra money to skip the line.",up up and away to a fabulous view
"August 9, 2019",Wow still as amazing. I went on this 19 years ago and it’s still just as fabulous. My sister ( her first visit) and I enjoyed the ease of fast track and the 4D London eye movie show was spectacular and good fun. Staff very helpful. Good value for money,Seeing the City on a rainy day!
"August 9, 2019","We could see absolutely everything in the city. We were amazed at how much construction was going on, so a lot of the buildings had scaffolding around them. We bought the 360 map so we could tell what everything was and it was worth buying.",Rip off
"August 8, 2019",Toured London and stopped by. Very pretty sight but Went to buy tickets only to find out they’re 30 pounds! That’s a crazy price for one time around the wheel. Instead we toured local places and got a more meaningful experience than we would’ve waiting in line for an overpriced Ferris wheel.,A Must Visit!
"August 8, 2019",Taking a ride on the London Eye was number one on my son's list of things to do in London. We booked an early appointment with a fast pass and it worked out great. About a 10 min wait time and he very much enjoyed it!,Fantastic views
"August 7, 2019","We had to queue for quite some time to get tickets, then queue again to actually get on the eye, but once we were on, the views were fantastic.",Magnificent views from the Eye
"August 7, 2019","Loved this ride. It was a nice slow pace, and the views of the Thames and London were spectacular. Our pod only had about 25 people in it, so not crowded. I have a huge fear of heights but that fear disappeared while we went on this. Highly recommend this!",Fabulous Thames River Cruise and London Eye
"August 7, 2019",The Thames River Cruise was full of sights and sounds. So relaxing going down the river and seeing all the beautiful buildings. It was a little hard to hear the guide but enjoyed it immensely. We then got off and went on the London Eye. I had no idea I would love this so much. What a great way to look all around London. Fantastic views and it takes about 30 minutes to make the full revolution so it hardly feels like you're moving. A must do when in London!!,Bought the fast track but couldn't pull it up on either of our phones
"August 7, 2019","The London Eye was a zoo. We bought the fast track to skip the massive lines but couldn't get the tickets to pull up on either phone so had to wait in a very slow moving line to get paper tickets. If you purchase, definitely print your tickets at the hotel. I was underwhelmed with the the slow moving ""eye"" and was ready to get off about halfway through. I think it was overpriced and overrated.",Overpriced
"August 7, 2019","It’s as simple as supply and demand - this is a popular attraction so they get to charge a lot to do it. Since we had a limited time in London and it was one of the few things my son wanted to do - I bought the skip the line tickets to save on time.  £70+ later we were on.  Half way up the line they took a picture of us that we had the option to purchase at the end of we liked. Your image is photographed with the background of Big Ben and Westminster Abby in the back and you can choose from £20 or £25 package (which includes key chain sized photos and 2 key chains to go with it).  Take your own - it’s not as perfect, but it’s more meaningful and memorable. The trip itself took just under 30 mins. While you do get to see a far distance in London (I feel the best views were of Westminster Abby, Big Ben (currently under restoration until 2021 BTW), and the River Thames. While I would do this again for half the price - I wouldn’t for what we paid. I certainly wouldn’t stand in the massive lines as it would not be worth the wait - keep in mind this was August and the city is bubbling with tourists.  I’d rather spend the wait time at The Tower of London (which I did last year) or somewhere else where you can experience some of the rich culture of the city.  So as I won’t pay to skip the lines and I won’t wait in the long lines it is safe to say I won’t do this one again.",Not worth it
"August 7, 2019","The London Eye is obviously a popular landmark for tourists and the experience is understandably an iconic one. Yet, I don’t recommend that you put in the efforts required to endeavour in this experience.First of all, it’s much more money than it’s worth. I would recommend that, if you want to see views from London, go to the balconies of the Tate Modern Art Gallery or enter the Sky Garden-both of which are free. Second of all, queueing will take you forever in the summer holidays-which could be time wasted if you aren’t staying in London for long.",Poor signing and horrible queues
"August 7, 2019","I had not been before and I thought the signing for where to pay needs to be bigger and more prominent .The queues were horrendous and laid out in zig zag snake pattern, like at the airport and very annoying. I would have liked to know how long to the embarking was when we paid and how long if we upgraded tickets not difficult to do these days. The queue seemed to merge into other queues for other attractions and it was not the greatest experience.As you were about to get in your pod you were held up with a photo opp and a shop which everyone had to pass through, very badly laid out as not everyone wanted the services and it caused further delays.Once on board it was a good experience, pods not overloaded and great views with a cheery welcome and warm goodbye voice recording, staff very helpful disembarking and this was done quickly and efficiently.I would take any Visitors to London again to the attraction but only if you improve the embarkation part of the experience.",London Eye not worth $40.00
"August 7, 2019",Not worth 40.00 to be crowded with 15 to 20 other people in this capsule ride for 30 min . Yes the view is nice but way to expensive .  ,Incredible views
"August 6, 2019",What a great way to see London (especially all of the construction cranes when we were there). 30 minute trip gives plenty of time to look in all directions. Would recommend the skip the line ticket because that saved a lot of time for us as the regular line was crazy long.,Traveler
"August 8, 2019",I think it's mandatory to visit this place if you're spending vacation  with family in London. Great view.Before you come here check weather forecast to be sure you will be able to see something;) ,Great Experience
"August 8, 2019",Highly recommended to pay for the fast track line. It save a good couple of hours in a busy day to experience the London Eye,Loved it
"August 8, 2019","The views are absolutely fantastic, highly recommended if visiting London. It is a very busy attraction though and would definitely advise booking a time slot ahead of visiting. Having said that the staff are well organised and very helpful. ",Great views
"August 8, 2019",Worth buying the express ticket there was a long queue. The 30 minute trip went fast. Great views so many landmarks to spot.,Wonderful Experience
"August 8, 2019",Wife and I totally enjoyed this ride. The line was fairly long but it moves quickly. If you are willing to wait a few minutes in line rather than paying for the fast track tickets which others in our pod paid £40 each for. ,See the City from Above!
"August 8, 2019","We liked the London Eye.  While it was quite busy when we lined up, the queue seemed to move quickly.  The pods are very big, with some seating and glass walls all around.  They even mark on the floor where to stand for the photo opp.The ride is rather slow as it stops to let people on and off consistently.  Not like carnival ferris wheels that let a few seats on then speed up for a few rounds.  This is mostly okay since most people are onboard for the view.  Going slow give you lots of time to soak it in.If you're in London, I think you just have to see it.  It's worth it if you want a view from the heights. Plus, that area right around the Eye is quite active and fun with a cool playground for the littles and live entertainment for all.",Great views!
"August 8, 2019",I recommend booking online for a timeslot to avoid the long lines. Also best if you have already done some sightseeing so you know what you’re looking at.  ,Great views of London
"August 7, 2019",We used the timed ticket at 6 in the evening. A little pricey but we did enjoy the views and a chance to get our bearings having just arrived that afternoon.,Good experience 
"August 7, 2019",Had heard a lot bout London eye   enjoyed sitting in it saw the whole of London from top took a lot of pics and shared with family and friends ,Fun activity
"August 7, 2019",Great fun activity to do with all ages. Views are amazing as you’d expect being so high up. Exciting to pick out the different landmarks. The London Eye is an excellent piece of engineering and a very memorable experience.,Trip
"August 25, 2019","Well worth giving it a try, I hate heights but managed it the view is breath taking, I was a little apprehensive but plucked up courage and glad I did",Do this
"August 25, 2019",The view is tremendous. It was a treat to get on because it does not stop to let you on. Just take a large step and away you go.,Good way to see London overall
"August 25, 2019","We enjoyed our London Eye and river cruise experience, although I would suggest that you do the cruise first, so that you can get information from the tour guide what you are looking at.  That way, when you go up in the Eye, you know what you are looking down on.  The crowds are a little much, but it's part of the price you pay when you go to a tourist city in the middle of summer.",Amazing Views
"August 25, 2019","At the top of the London Eye you get to experience some of the most amazing views of the London skyline from all angles since the ride is cover in transparent glass all over. The river Thames tour experience was also amazing. You get to see some of the most historic buildings along the Thames including the House of Commons or Parliament, the tour guide was great and fun and provided many interesting historical facts about each place we passed by during the ride. The river tour lasted approximately 30 to 45 minutes. And one whole round on the London Eye takes approximately 15 minutes. I recommend it for friends, couples or the entire family.",London eye
"August 25, 2019",A wonderful  place from which you can see almost whole London. Definitely  coming back . Me and my friends totally  enjoy it .,360 Degree Views
"August 24, 2019",Great 35 minute ride to see all of London. Very clean and secure but a bit crowded so it was not always easy to get the photo shot you wanted. Pay for the FastTrac it’s worth it or you’ll be waiting for hours. Preferred this over the Shard for views.,Excellent Experience.
"August 24, 2019","We got ""Fast  track VIP experience with guide"" by Get Your Guide.  It was really nice to have the guide cause you get more information about the city.  The view is excellent and the ride is long enough to enjoy everything.",Expensive for what it is
"August 24, 2019","It is a very touristy thing and most people think it is a 'must see' thing in London however it is basically a large ferris wheel. The view is good however I am still unsure whether it is worth the high price tag, it probably depends on each individual. In my opinion it not.",London Eye
"August 24, 2019",glas we got the fast track - line for general admission was huge.   Awesome views of the entire London skyline from the eye.  Very cool.,Spectacular!  
"August 24, 2019","We did the champagne experience last week.  We bought our tickets a few months ago.  When we arrived, we were directed to a nice area with a bar.  We were given a glass of champagne and a non-alcoholic drink for my 12 yr old daughter.  We were allowed another glass of champagne in lieu of my daughter being underage. Soon after a lovely young woman (name began with an H) came to collect the group.  She was so, so nice and acted as both a guide and host.  She escorted us to the capsule.  Fast tracked us on in minutes. We were lucky in that there were only a total of 13 of us (I think normally 20 for this experience).  Our guide/host poured us more champagne (and juice for my daughter).  She pointed out all the significant landmarks.  She offered and took time to take photos of each person/party.  It was a relaxing and enjoyable 30 minutes.  I was nervous that the height may get to me, but I was very comfortable.  It was overcast and raining, yet I thoroughly loved it!  The views were absolutely spectacular even in the rain...wouldn’t be London without rain, right? I highly recommend this experience!  ",Once is enough 
"August 6, 2019","It’s a fantastic experience, but once is defiantly enough. When you see the queue and have already done it I’d say walk straight past and go experience something different in London. ",This was a one off
"August 6, 2019","We purchased a ticket online however we had trouble redeeming it. The staff helped us out and the eye was magical.  I enjoyed the pod which was full with 4 different nationally. Being the first time, it was worth it ",Was ok
"August 6, 2019","We did this at night and although it was nice to see the city lit up, it was hard to see the actual buildings. We paid for fast track and it was worth as the line was very long, the entire process took about 45 minutes.",On a clear day
"August 6, 2019",The view is wonderful.Not worth Fast Track really at £10 per person as the queue does move quite quickly.All in all a nice time,Fantastic views
"August 6, 2019",Although it was a 45 min queue the system to keep you moving was good. Great views and the pods are not too crowded so you can move around to see different views,Great view over London!
"August 6, 2019",Terrific views of Big Ben and all of London from a large gondola you can walk around in to see in all directions during the ride. Great experience but expect long lines.,Day out with family 
"August 6, 2019","I was Never interested in visiting the London eye, so I didn’t follow all the hype But it was a day out with family (my parents wanted to visit) I don’t regret it Sights were awesome the time around was lovely 45 minutes only issue I had was the number of people crammed into the pod felt a little Overcrowded but I’m also afraid of heights so that could be the issue! I enjoyed myself and would do this again ",Beautiful view
"August 6, 2019",Go to the 4D cinema before London eye. It takes like 5-10 minutes. There wasn't a queue. London eye was nice but I think I would rather go to Jubilee gardens and go on their swing ride and enjoy the view from there.,"great time, and its an experience worth while to take."
"August 6, 2019","I recommend 1st timer to London to take this experience.. u get a chances to see London differently from the top..too bad the big ben is under renovation, unable to see it from the eye.","its an interesting tours, able to view London from the eye is definitely great experiences"
"August 6, 2019",Queue up to the Eye even its the standard tickets is not take very long... even that that time there are many tourist and its summer time. we took the Eye before going to the river cruise as the cruise is a fixed time.,London eye
"July 21, 2019",Beautiful. Definitely worth it. Lines went fast. Not scary at all. Enjoyed it a lot. Would highly recommend,Fantastic views of London
"July 21, 2019","On my bucket list, booked well in advance and we were lucky with a really pleasant day. The Bank holiday was about to begin so preparations were in full swing, crowds collecting so prebooked tickets saved ages of queuing and the actual loading of each capsule was very well organised. It’s a very smooth turn of the great wheel and easy to take photos or a video, really enjoyed it",Mediocre Experience
"July 21, 2019","The London Eye is one of those tourist attractions that are just what you expect them to be, mediocre and crowded. I will say that the queues, whether fast track or regular, moved pretty fast. They are also pretty efficient in which ways to direct people.  What I do not understand about the entire process, is the price. I thought that the price paid (fast track ticket for one adult and one child) was pretty expensive. As you ascend, you realize that there really is nothing too fascinating about going high in the air to view the skyline of London. If you go during the 2019 season, be aware that renovations for Big Ben and Parliament are ongoing so, you will not get a good photo op there. My advice to you is to either wait until the afternoon to go, when all of the initial crowds have left or wait until later in the evening.  But, overall, i would skip this altogether and walk over the many bridges instead to take in the scenery.",Good view of London
"July 21, 2019","It is a nice thing to do. But it is very expensive, even when you buy the combo with another atraction in London. The view is ok. But you can go to other places in London where you have beautiful views as well and do not need to spend any penny",Good Arial View of London
"July 20, 2019",Popular and crowded. You do get a spectacular 360 degree view of London.  The ride lasts 30 minutes. Very steady ride. Even people with motion sickness can handle this. Not: Buy your tickets in advance if possible. You can buy them onsite as well from multiple kiosks. A 4D movie experience is included with the ticket and is located in the tickets office.,Must visit
"July 20, 2019",Must visit This attraction we had some family over so we decided to take them to the London Eye this is definitely a must visit for any tourists visiting London,Spectacular view of the city
"July 20, 2019",Busy tourist attraction but the view of the city is well worth it.  All pods are air conditioned and enclosed so you can't fall out.  Careful when you get on and off of the pod as it's still in motion.  Pods are slow enough that it provides a spectacular view of London.,Great view!
"July 20, 2019","Fast and efficient service. The queue moves fast, so don't bother buying the fast track ticket. Great views, especially on sunny days.",Fabulous view
"July 20, 2019",So worth going! Just a great view of London. Perfect way to get pictures. Love the fact they don’t pack you in the cars. Plenty of room to move around and see.,Are you afraid of heights
"July 20, 2019","To be honest, this attraction was not on my bucket list but my grandson really wanted to experience it so we went.  The cars hold about 30 people and it moves so slowly that you do not have the sense of being on a carnival ride.  The whole car seems to be made of some type of Plexiglas, including the floor.  My grandson found this very uncomfortable and disorienting and spent most of the rotation sitting on the bench in the middle of the car.   The views are nice but nothing you could not see from other vantage points.  The other thing to be aware of is that the other passengers in your car will compete for the best vantage points and they tend to stay in those spots until a better view is available elsewhere in the car.  If you are not an aggressive person, you probably won't get the photos you were hoping for on this attraction.  Still, the views of historic London are impressive and for those who don't get queasy when they can see what is beneath their feet, it can be a great experience.  ",Fun experience 
"July 20, 2019",I visited this. Attraction in the afternoon.  I had a great time and have wonderful memories and pictures.  I purchased a multi ticket online beforehand and saw Shrek and the london dungeon.  I showed up for the river cruise 10 minutes before start time and was thoroughly disappointed that I couldn't ride on the top of the boat because it was full.  A bit of a disappointment since this was my birthday celebration.  I wouldn't get on a subpar trip so we left and had a delightful time at Hard Rock Piccadilly circus!,splendid
"July 20, 2019","If the weather is good , Its spectacular,make sure you book in advance ,to get in on the day can take a few hours",Worth to visit 
"July 19, 2019","Even if it was a raining day in London, this attraction remains a must to do !! Lovely view on all the major love to visit in London !",Spectacular
"July 19, 2019",I watched a show on NG which was following the construction and engineering.I was fascinated. Great engineering achievement.,Wonderful views of London
"July 18, 2019","We decided to take the London Eye on a spur of the moment. I expected long lines and was prepared to wait for a long time, but despite not purchasing the express tickets (not worth it in my view unless you're in a terrible hurry) and arriving at what I assume is peak time (4-5pm), we were able to get on within 45 minutes. The queue is teed up well ahead of the boarding time and it moves quickly and efficiently. The views are spectacular and I only wish we were there at a different time when the sunlight wasn't as strong.",Bored to tears
"July 18, 2019",Fairly friendly ticket-sales staff and fairly competent security staff scaring my 5yr girl. Does not warrant the 30pounds ticket price per adult. What made it average is actually paying 23 pounds each for my 5 yr old who was only tagging along with her older 8yr sister. Then the surprise that the London Eye is fun for those who are afraid of adrenaline. Go do it if you are like Mr Bean,London Eye
"July 17, 2019",I recommend getting your tickets ahead of time and give yourself plenty of time to get there! It is absolutely stunning. And if you time it right.....go right before dusk. Amazing to watch the lights of the city go on as the sun goes down!!!!! A must do!!,Stop on London before went on British Isles Cruise
"July 17, 2019",We stayed very handy the london Eye.  It takes a hour to go around the Eye and the views were wonderful.  Each compartment holds quite a few people.  You will get great camera shots from up there.,Busy but queue moves quickly
"July 17, 2019",Great to see London from a central and high vantage point. Staff efficient rather than friendly. Recommend going earlier in the day if you can manage that.,Waste of money
"July 17, 2019",Prepare to enormous queues even if you have prebooked your tickets. The view over London is really amazing but you enjoy it just for 10 minutes or so while you are on top. You can get the same view (including on London Eye) for less if you go to any sky-scraper in around. ,Famous Monument
"July 17, 2019",I did not get the opportunity to get into the monument but visited it by far.  Busy area and nice to see about,Fast Track is the Way to Go!
"July 17, 2019","Had Fast Track tickets for the London Eye. I didn't the last time I took grandchildren, and it took FOREVER to work our way up to the attraction. It is not a scary ride at all. It is benign, you have incredible opportunities to see some 30 miles out, take photos and just chill.It is so iconic that you just have to do it if you are in London, or you won't have had the full London experience. Kids adore it!",Ms
"July 16, 2019","We were not so impressed with this , we we were hurried to get a ticket & had to choose a time to come back - which was worthless- it was merely a time to come and stand in line for 45 minutes before we got on the actual eye they corralled us on with 20 other people that spoke a different language -we felt like a herd of cattle. Once  on the actual vessel the speaker comes on and starts trying to sell additional events. Really truly not worth the money or the time to do it again we would avoid",Fantastic Views
"July 16, 2019","We decided to do the London Eye and, seeing the queue, decided to fast-track and pay the extra ten pounds to do this. Fortunately, given that I  use a walking stick at the moment, fast tracking was free and we were quickly onto the London Eye. Surprisingly the photo that was taken at the start was good so we paid 20 pounds for this. The 30 mins (approx) ride was great. It was a great day with lots of sunshine and we enjoyed every moment of it.",Worth the Wait
"July 16, 2019",Bought our ticket combo with the London Eye river cruise which we took first. It was great taking us past lots of hallmark sights. Returned to dock to see the huge lines waiting for the Eye. Worth the wait to see London from up high. Would buy fast pass next time!,"Best views of London, a must"
"July 16, 2019","Fabulous views of the city. Clear day really helps. Booked time slot in advance, so limited queuing. Very well run. Helpful staff.",Not your aveage Ferris Wheel
"July 16, 2019","The London Eye is a cool feat of engineering that is safe, exciting and provides an amazing view of the entire city of London. There were a couple of people in my family who do not like ferris sheels and are scared of heights, but after mustering up the courage to ride this attraction, they loved every minute of it and never felt uncomfortable. The Pods are huge (accommodating around 20 people or more) and the ride is slow and smooth. A trip to London would not be complete without a ride on this modern addition to a historic city. Also, on a busy day, it was worth the few extra dollars for the fast pass.",Get a good view of the London city
"July 16, 2019",The normal queue was about 45 min wait. If you are in a hurry you can buy the fast track tickets at extre 10 Pounds. If its cloudy would not be worth the money. Quite and moves very slowly. Wheel Chair and disability customers are very well supported. zThey do stop the eye for them. Do not miss the 4d presentation.,Worth the experienc
"July 15, 2019",Not mind-blowing but certainly gives you a birds eye view of London. Slow moving and air conditioned capsules make it comfortable for all ages. Suggest doing it at night or on a clear day. ,Lovely evening
"July 15, 2019","My partner and I booked the London eye for 8:15 on a Saturday night. The queue looked very long however it was continuously moving and only took 20 minutes to get to the front. I haven’t been on the eye since I was little so it was nice to go back, the views were lovely at that time of night but you can get better views from the shard. We only paid £30 altogether which was fine, I wouldn’t pay any more for it! ",Is a great experience! A must do.
"July 25, 2019","I was very happy I have bought a fast ticker because queues are long. Make sure you understand if you have to go to the desk to exchange the coupon or if what you have is already a ticket. And arrive with at least 20 minutes prior time.Some relevant landmarks cannot be seen form London Eye, yet the whole experience and the perfection of how this have been developed is worth the experience.","2nd Largest ""Ferris Wheel"" in the World!"
"July 25, 2019","My daughter wanted to do this -- so we took the Tube to Westminister Bridge, and walked over to this attraction. It helps to purchase Fast Track Tickets before hand -- saves a lot of time in the long lines. It’s not really a ferris wheel (though it sure looks like one -- on steroids) -- it's the world’s tallest cantilevered observation wheel.The views were stunning -- and they offered a good photo op from the gondola you ride in. If you're afraid of heights, you might want to skip this -- at the highest point it is almost 445' above ground. After our ride we were amazed at how it dominates the London skyline. We could even see it from St. James Park near Buckingham Palace!Can you imagine: supermodel Kate Moss has been on the London Eye 25 times – the record for any UK celebrity.",Highly recommend you buy your tickets in advance
"July 25, 2019","Unless you get there right when it opens, I highly suggest you buy tickets online. The line to buy the tickets was long and then once you have the tickets the line to get on the Eye is even longer. We intended to buy beforehand, but weren't sure which day we would go. The ride is nice and slow and you can take in the views of London. There are plenty of picture opportunities. Each capsule is rather large, so those who may be afraid of heights might do better on here versus a regular Ferris wheel.",Impressive to See
"July 25, 2019",We were on a bus tour that dropped us off in front of the Eye. We were short for time to the Tower so we didn’t actually get on the Eye. It was also an overcast day so our driver didn’t recommend it. Looks like it would be fun otherwise.,Great experience 
"July 25, 2019",Last Saturday I decided to get this in with my two friends visiting from the US. We did the fast track as it was only £10 more per person but we were able to board quickly. The queues were very long for normal admission. The pics at the end we took two booklets valued at 25£ each with two pictures and the keychain and magnets. Memories I guess. ,Stunning views
"July 24, 2019","I think anyone who visits London should treat themselves to the London Eye. The views are incredible, all-be-it a bit murky when we did it. We got there early in the morning to get tickets so to avoid the queues. The pod was clean and we only had a few other people in with us. It takes about a hour to complete.",Nice but Dirty Windows and Pictures
"July 24, 2019","Spectacular views but the gondolae are very dirty on the outside. So practically impossible to take pictures from the inside through a clean window, always tons of dirt visible on my pictures. Also they close far too early for a day in July (20.30), so no sunset pics ;-/",Nice to see
"July 24, 2019",The London eye is a great 30 minute Ferris wheel ride to see great sites of London. A must do in London.,Spectacular Views and of course Madame Tussauds is a must in London!
"July 24, 2019","I was able to convince my wife to join me on this and she was nervous, but not disappointed. The views were incredible! The only thing I would say is be prepared for very long lines and crowds.",Awesome experience 
"July 23, 2019",This is wonderful ride. Make sure to buy your ticket with the fast pass. It will save you alot of time. Well worth it.,Beautiful view at a cost
"July 8, 2019",We went on a the London Eye as we thought it was a must. The view was spectacular and loved the experience however it was very expensive (close to $240 AUD). You do get an awesome view but I’m not sure it was worth the cost! Best to couple it with Madame Tassauds for a better price if you’re keen .,never made it past the queue
"July 8, 2019","too many people. arrived exactly at prebooked slot, and was told that we needed to wait for another hour to get in. our schedule didnt allow, so we skipped.oversold experience.",VIP Champagne Experience
"July 8, 2019","I would really recommend this. No queueing, relaxing in the VIP lounge with a champagne cocktail overlooking the eye before being escorted to the cabin for the trip. More champagne on board. Excellent , no fuss, no tress",Spectacular views
"July 7, 2019","From boarding the MBNA Clipper until the completion of the ride on the London Eye, the views of the skyline were spectacular. The cabin was comfortable and the aft section was a good location for photos on the river. There is plenty of room in the capsule on the Eye for passengers to view the sights from every angle.",Great way to see London from above
"July 7, 2019","Great way to see London from above .Spacious gondola with seating if needed ,but can be very busy in peak times ",Nice views 
"July 7, 2019","As Merlin Premium passholders, we decided to do the London Eye. We went to the information stand in order to book a time slot and the man told us 4:15, 20 minutes passed and we looked at the ticket he had issued us with and it said 4:45 so we had a slight panic as we had things to do at 5:15 (the attraction is about 30 minutes long) - we went back and he said “yeah you need to queue at 4:15” so that’s what we did. The whole thing was really confusing. Not quite sure why our ticket said 4:45 if we were allowed in at 4:15? As Merlin holders, we get fast track which is definitely worth it. The queues were huge!! The London Eye itself is good for views across London. You can see many tourist attractions, such as Buckingham Palace. If I wasn’t a pass holder, then I wouldn’t pay for the Eye though as I feel it’s overpriced. I would definitely do this again, but only with my Merlin pass. ",Eye in the sky
"July 7, 2019","Do This!!  A phenomenal view of London and all the iconic buildings.  The pods are spacious, have seating in the middle and are easy to move around in while you go on your journey to the top and back down again.  Plenty of photo opportunities and smooth and quiet.  Definitely recommend.",Nice view
"July 6, 2019",2013Everything about this was awesome. This is a must in London. Very nice highlight of a bday trip .Viewing London at the top on the London eye while sipping champagne🍾.Great memories..It's kid friendly as well minus the champagne😄,Expensive and Not Worth It
"July 6, 2019","They say this is the most visited tourist attraction in the UK.  It certainly feels that way but having done it I can't imagine why.  The fast track ticket did get us priority entrance but when we went at 8:30 in the evening there were hardly any lines.  For a family of 4 the fast track tickets cost us nearly $175.  You enter a pod with a dozen other people and then spend 30 minutes seeing the London skyline.  However, with the exception of Parliament/Big Ben right across the river there really isn't all that much to see.  Its difficult to take pictures with the glass surrounding you and the views just aren't that exciting.  It feels like this is something you ""have to do"" when you visit London but I'd recommend you skip it.  It just wasn't worth it.  Even my kids - ages 10 & 13 - didn't rank this as a highlight of our London trip.  If it is true that this is the most visited tourist attraction then it is very likely that it is the least re-visited attraction.",I liked it a lot more than I thought I would
"July 6, 2019","I was here with a University group in London for 48 hours on the way home to the USA.  Although I thought of it as too much of a tourist trap, it was one of the most requested activities from my group.  When I found out there a huge discounts for school and university groups I added it and the river cruise associated with it to our agenda.  It was great.I am afraid of heights, so I wasn't actually sure I would not chicken out.  It turns out that I had no problem at all.  The pads are so big, it turns so slowly, and the support spokes are so massive that I had absolute no fear at all.By getting the river tour first, we knew what to look for from the eye.I am glad that my students talked me into adding it to the London itinerary and encouraged me to go on board.",Great river tour
"May 2, 2022","The cruise was great, we enjoyed beautiful views, learned some historical facts about the buildings and the city. We also got some great tips on places to visit while in London. Vicky was our guide, she made the visit very fun and entertained for all the passengers. I will repeat this experience with friends soon!",Eye Loved it!
"May 2, 2022",This was a great day. Didn’t have to queue long (20 mins) booked ticket on the day of visit and still had lots of slots available. Staff were friendly and views are amazing. We joined the queue at time of ticket.,Too expensive
"May 2, 2022",It’s a good experience but it’s definitely not worth the money. Family of 4 is £100. You go round slowly once and it was very hot. I think the price needs to be more affordable so more people can experience the London eye.,Great 45 min tour
"May 2, 2022",Last minute booking 45 mins tour - all on time Very scenic Great tour guide - very entertaining Great views from most positions on top deck Enjoyed very much Worth booking and trying,Must do when new to london
"May 1, 2022",A must do once to get yourself orientated as a infrequent visitor. Feels like there could be more info in the pods to let you know what you are seeing,Interesting
"May 1, 2022","The River Cruise commentator, Michael,was really informative and really made the commentary interesting.I would recommend doing the river Cruise before the Eye as it helps you recognise what you are seeing.",Great experience 
"April 30, 2022","Really enjoyed this trip up the Thames and hearing about some of the history and bridges. Seeing London from a different perspective was great experience. Our guide was Mike and he was knowledgeable and very funny too. It was well worth the cost, we paid for priority to sit in front row and was worth it. Many things in London are expensive but this was very good value. Highly recommend if you've got an hour to kill or want to see London from different view ",Great Trip
"April 30, 2022",Queues were not too long so didn't gave to wait too long to get on. Pods were clean and staff friendly and efficient.,Really good
"April 30, 2022","Really worth to see London from a top view. The ride itself was good and imagine that with a beautiful view, really nice And we really enjoyed",The Bar Pod experience 👌
"April 30, 2022","“Last minute.com” we had the best London eye experience yesterday with a (FREE) upgrade to the Jameson Bar Pod at 13:00pm, they say you get nothing for free in this world, we yesterday we did, we got a free upgrade for a standard price, Dan “number 2” employee (he’s making it) had us laughing from the off… and Harriet was on her 1st day, a great asset to the team; we where made to feel welcome through the whole experience, we shared the Pod with some Canadians and some other great people, if you get offered this something for nothing experience do not dismiss it easily like others did, I am an avid Jameson drinker so it was almost Tailer made, we had two 50ml drinks through the duration of our journey, I will add the journey was some 30mins that seemed like 30 seconds… seriously I rate last minute.com with the highest possible rating James & Natasha from Norfolk  10⭐️",Beautiful sights.
"May 5, 2022","All of it! It moves very slow and gives you plenty of time to see everything and take pictures. The views are simply amazing. No jerking, very smooth ride. Will do again when I go back.",Great experience.
"May 5, 2022",Everything worked very well.  Friendly stuff and almost no waiting time.  We had a lovely sunny day with a great view.,Amazing!
"May 5, 2022","We booked Fast Track tickets and guided into our pods very quickly. Amazing ride, with incredible views across London. Highly recommended!",Good views
"May 5, 2022","Great Views, also a very quick entry before the booked time and the ""cabins"" are not full. A very pleasant 30 minutes.",Great way to celebrate my birthday!
"May 4, 2022",Liam was a great guide! I highly recommend the champagne experience for a more relaxed time where you can skip the line and enjoy a drink and the view. Well worth the cost of a ticket. Our guide gave us a wonderful tour and shared some facts about the surrounding buildings.,Wonderful
"May 3, 2022",It was a nice flight humble as well a friendly people working there on serving all guests I wish visit that place again,Queue shorter than expected
"May 3, 2022","We were toying with paying the extra for fast track, but pleased we didn't. On a very sunny Saturday on a public holiday weekend I was fearing the worst for the queues, but on the standard ticket it was only about 15 minutes for a 11.45am advance booking. When I passed by on Sunday around 5pm it was even shorter a queue (although a bit of a gloomy day).The ""flight"" as they call it takes around 30 minutes. It doesn't seem like it should take that long, but indeed it does!As for the boat trip, that's ok. The most photograph worthy sites are the Houses of Parliament and Tower Bridge, the section between is no more photogenic than just walking the South Bank for free. Even the Houses of Parliament and Tower Bridge can be seen in close up without getting on the boat. But I suppose its quicker on the boat than plodding around on foot.",Great views of London
"May 3, 2022",Arrived at time which we had booked online in advance.We took advantage of buy one get one free with train travel.Great views of the city.Pod was not too busy so could move around and appreciate the different viewpoints.We bought the photo which was £20 which was expensive but came with a book. Might be better to offer a cheaper digital version for about £5 for families as it is an expensive visit.,Beautiful London  
"May 3, 2022",Absolutely beautiful ride with gorgeous views of the city. I suggest a day with blue skies and beautiful weather for the most outstanding photos.,Fabulous view 
"May 2, 2022",My son loved this so much. You had to wait a while to get on the pod. However the staff were helpful with guiding you on timings. The pods were not over filled and the experience was great. Security checks made it feel safe and the pods were really clean.,London eye 
"July 3, 2019",On every my visit to London I visited London Eye because I fallen in love with panoramic view from the top. I suggest to take fast track pass because difference between normal ticket and fast track is not much expensive. Try to be there 20 minute before sunset and catch up amazing view and see how all lights of London are turning on.,Good sight-seeing combo deal
"July 3, 2019","We got a package that included London eye, hop-on-off bus and a river cruise.  A great combo to explore the various sights in London.  Provides the flexibility to just sit and listen to the audio guide while seeing the sights from the bus, or hop-off to actually explore each of the top tourist destinations.  Either way, you won’t fear missing out, you own your own experience!",Always a great adventure
"July 3, 2019",The London eye is always a great way to introduce you to London or as a culminating event so you recognize places you’ve already seen.  I always take my student groups up there on the last night for one more picture and to recall what we’ve been doing for several days.  It is so easy to buy ahead online and print out at the kiosks when you arrive.  Fast Trak is a great idea if you hate to stand in line.,Great views
"July 3, 2019","Fun experience. It was raining when we went, but we still enjoyed the ride and the views! Goes so slowly you don't even know you are moving!! Highly recommend!!",Just Great!
"July 3, 2019",LondonSuper superb!686275209When in London you must take in this spectacular landmark experience!!We as a family loved it....Great views...great staff...great value...Just do it✔,Nice view
"July 2, 2019",Try the Fast Pass it will save you time in line that is better spent having a few pints at the local pub. The ride is about 30 minutes but goes fast so have those cameras ready. Nice time would definitely book again. ,Nice view
"July 2, 2019","You can get a really nice view from London in aprox 30min. I dont think you actually need an skip the line pass if you go early, but I would definitely recommend buying a + river cruise ticket",Waste of time and money!
"July 2, 2019","Wouldn’t recommend this to anyone. We were really excited to go on this on our weekend visit to London. The que on Friday afternoon in the scorching sun was huge, so we decided to pay extra (£10 per person on top of £30 per person tickets) for fast track tickets. We qued in fast track for more than half an hour! Each pod was crammed. Couldn’t move for folded up buggies, baby carriers and people. Buggies shouldn’t be allowed on in my opinion - the children have to be out of them and they have to be folded up, so pointless and take up space and are a hazard. Can’t get a good view due to number of people all fighting to stand at glass. Glass is dirty. Really disappointed by the experience and would not ever recommend this! ",An interesting whell of fortune
"July 2, 2019",I personally don't like it but many people like to get into it to have a nice view of London right at the Thames. I prefer many other places where you have a similar or better view of the city.,What A View!
"July 2, 2019","Although the lines were sorta long, it is so worth the wait. A great way to get a birds-eye view of a great city. I highly recommend it to any London newbie!","An eyesore on the skyline, but a vaguely interesting view."
"July 6, 2019","I have always considered the London Eye (under its many sponsorship brands over the last 20 years) as being a blot on the London riverside skyline.Having finally been persuaded to ride it I find it no less of an intrusion along the river, but the ride was at least novel.  I remain unsure that the minimal entertainment value justifies either its presence or the cost of the ticket, mind.",Definitely a must even if it isn't extremely exciting 
"July 6, 2019","We loved the London Eye. I certainly think that it's a great experience to enjoy in London. You can see so much and get an excellent idea of where everything is. I recommend the skip the line tickets if it's in your budget. We had a much shorter wait than the traditional line, however, if you are going at a slower time, it might be worth it to save the money. By the end, my 10 and 8 year old were asking if it was over yet, but overall, they really enjoyed it. It is air conditioned but perhaps not to American standards. It was quite warm.",Nice view
"July 6, 2019","The price of thirty pounds was quite steep in my opinion, for comparison the Singapore flyer costs around 20 pounds, while the smaller Hong Kong one is three pounds. The view of from the Ferris wheel was nice and not too many people were put into each cabin as I feared would happen. The wait was somewhat long at twenty minutes, but I went during a weekday around 3:00 so probably one of the least busiest times.",Stunning views
"July 5, 2019","Now a modern icon in London, I find the views to be stunning and the experience to a lot of fun.  That being said, it's not the cheapest 30 minutes, and if you add the fast track option it can really add up.  Buying your tickets online 24 hours or more in advance saves you a few dollars, and if you combine it with a river tour, you can save more, but the downfall with buying online is you have to know exactly when you are going to go, eg 1:15-1:30pm.  Regardless of when you go, there will likely be line-ups.  Beware there is a line-up to buy/collect your ticket, then a line-up to get on the London Eye.  To minimize wait time, usually the first one or two hours of the day tend to be better, and better on a weekday than on a weekend.  Of course you can take the fast track option, which can save you anywhere from 30-75 minutes depending on the length of the lines, but at 10 Pounds more per ticket, it's a bit pricey, but time is money. Regardless, the London Eye is a must try experience.  ",its a glorified farriswheel
"July 5, 2019",Slow moving large glass domes. Can see London but I found it boring after half of the trip. Did not hold 11 yr olds interest either./,Good way to see things from a distance 
"July 5, 2019","My husband, my 13 year old daughter and myself did this. It was a nice experience but the line was way too long. Not sure I’d be willing to wait in a line like that with small kids. ",Wonderful experience
"July 5, 2019","Not inexpensive and expect very long lines and few if any available seats for waiting.  We paid a few pounds extra for the VIP queue; there was still a wait of about an hour from the time we arrived, but it was well worth it.  Lovely views, lovely photos.",Not worth the Money
"July 5, 2019","I and 3 others booked a slot for the London eye at 1:30 pm when we arrived (half an hour early as instructed) the queue was over an hour, we queried about our time slot but we were just told to get to the back of the queue which was around the corner. We didn't end up going onto the London eye due to the queue times & the heat.Don't use the vending machine in the ticket office either as we attempted to get some water out, it never came out but we were debted £12.We spoke to the staff in the ticket office who confirmed we could get a refund however we booked online so we had to email them and they would refund us. We have emailed the office and haven't heard anything back it has been over a week and from reading other reviews it doesn't look hopeful.",Fast pass but not necessary
"July 4, 2019","As many people have said, a fast pass and prebooking are truly not necessary. Having said that, I paid for the fast pass and it only saved me no more than 5 mins!  So buy regular tickets when you want to go and just line up in the regular line. It’s an awesome 30 mins as it gives you a cool view from up high. Great for a few pics and for the experience. Would probably not do it again as it was £40 pounds each!",Much better than general admission
"July 3, 2019","Two years ago, we used General Admission and were frustrated by the wait.  This time, we purchased the Fast Track and are so glad we did.  Tremendous difference.  Well worth the few dollars extra.",American Mom and 12 Year Old Son
"June 26, 2019","Stunning view- paid for faster admission, which looking at the lines was worth it.  Enjoyed the 4D movie ahead of time.  I feel like it is a must see, but not something you'd ever feel like you had to repeat.  If you have ever been to Wall Drug in the U.S., I'd say it offers that same feeling.  You have to do it, but you'd say once is enough.",A must do London attraction
"June 26, 2019",My teenage children loved the wheel and the staff are excellent. Very friendly get your photo take but book online to save yourself time!,london eye
"June 26, 2019","a sort of ""must do"" which doesn't disappoint. Go early - it's a very crowded area and the queue at the Eye is fairly slow.  We were ""with wheelchair"" and were well looked after - somewhat of a fast track.   The pods are not overcrowded and have a bit of seating.  If you know London sights it is nice,  if you are seeing them for the first time it must be fairly amazing.If you can - go when you have visited a few other places so you can orientate - pick your previous places out even!",Great ride
"June 26, 2019","It is a little expensive, considering London isn't the most beautiful city from above, but we hadn't been on a wheel before so we really enjoyed it.",On high. 4
"June 26, 2019",Usually we avoid this type of mega attraction. However with 12 and 14 year old granddaughters who suggested it. Bought tix online and saw a huge line when we arrived. Joined it and surprisingly moved quite fast. Boarding the module was a little thrilling as it was moving. It was clean and not overcrowded. The ride took about 30 minutes.  Of course the views were spectacular. Lot a pix and fun with girls. A good trip.,Dry sense of humor of River Cruise Director was hysterical
"June 25, 2019",The London Eye provided excellent views of London. The guided River Cruise provided a great history lesson with humor and wit. A great way to see the city!,Day out!!
"June 25, 2019","What an excellent way to spend 1/2 hour seeing London from a great height. The actual organisational side of things are excellent, your not in the queues very long and then the staff promptly gets you on and your away. A fantastic attraction to visit absolutely brilliant!!",Not quite worth the money 
"June 24, 2019",For two people at 60-80 pound based on whether you go fast track. If you want a good view go with the shard ,the view is breathtaking
"June 24, 2019",I went on a sunny afternoon and it was great I could see well outside the city . Buy the fast track ticket it is worth the extra 10 pounds . It only took 15 min verses 45 min in the regular line. ,Vacation 
"June 24, 2019","Buy the fast pass a day ahead of time, saves you money and time. We arrived 5 minutes before our scheduled time and were immediately entered in the que. took about 20 minutes to board while walk up ticket purchasers it was taking over an hour. Could see very far and the views were gorgeous. Highly recommended.",Tourist trap
"June 22, 2019","It was ok - I'm not sure about the hype. Yes, you see London from a birds eye view but was it worth it waiting in line? Our 'pod' had several zealous photo 'hogs' so that was annoying, as well. I'd take a river ride before you spend your money on this.",Amazing views!
"June 21, 2019",Highly recommend- the pictures and the views are amazing!  Well worth the cost of the ticket - buy skip the line tickets (in advance if you can) and avoid the lines.,Not to be missed
"June 21, 2019",Great first stop on any visit to London.   You can get a bird's eye view of the city and what you want to see later in the day.,Not bad!
"June 21, 2019","This was my first time on the Eye, however I have previously climbed to the top of St Paul's, and the view from up there is just as good in my opinion. Although, you do get a full 360 degree view from the London Eye. You're on the Eye for about 20 mins. I feel a little longer might be nicer (I don't think I would mind 2 rotations), but for a view of London, this is something you should definitely do.",Definitely worth the visit!!
"June 20, 2019",What a view!! Very comfortable and easy to get great photos from all angles. Fast track is a must!! Best part of our trip.,Nothing to see here.
"June 20, 2019","The lines are long, the ride is boring, the kids were bored, and the tickets are too expensive for what the experience.  Zero things to see above London, sans construction.  We counted at least 41 construction cranes in the skyline.  So so Boring.  Save your Euro!!!!  This thing should be free and it’s in a completely tourist trappy lane.",Kind of expensive and crowded
"June 19, 2019","It's a good way to see a birds-eye view of London, but the ride itself is kind of underwhelming.  Somewhat crowded pods, and if one of the guests has BO, as one did in our pod :(, it makes for a LONG 30-minute ride around the loop.",Amazing views of the city
"June 19, 2019",An incredible experience and a must do in the city of London. The views are amazing. I only wish it lasted longer- maybe two rotations!,Great views of London 
"June 19, 2019","The lines were long but we didn’t wait long to get in. You can sit in the middle, stand by the windows or a little of both, the choice is yours! The views are beautiful, even on a rainy day ",Birds Eye View of London
"June 19, 2019","Fast track entrance is a must.  Half hour to soak up all the sights of Westminster Bridge, Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, The Shard and the River Thames as well as sights from around the city.  The only down side was I booked it for 8pm thinking we would see London with night views but it is still light at 9.30pm in June",Great experience
"April 13, 2022","Wonderful experience,my little one was so exited,staff was so helpful,great experience with family,5 star",Way better than the actual London Eye!
"April 13, 2022","My favourite part of the experience was the swish and spacious boat and the knowledgable and witty guide. We had to run to get there on time, by which point there was no more seating upstairs, which was a shame, but that was the only negative. The river cruise was a bargain compared with the ultimately underwhelming and over-priced London Eye, and my children and I learnt an awful lot about the landmarks we could see. Our female guide (I didn’t catch her name unfortunately) not only knew her stuff, but was personable and engaging. I found all the staff helpful and friendly. It was a great trip.",Kids loved it
"April 13, 2022",Liam the tour guide was excellent. He was funny. Polite and friendly to the kids. We enjoyed the humour guide and had a good laugh. The boar trip was nice especially the weather being nice. Liam made the trip special !,Amazing!!!
"April 13, 2022","Amazing !! Went here with my Mum and Sister and we all loved it! Staff are very lovely and sweet 😊 The pictures that they take for you come out nice and clear 😻 No long waiting as there is a lot of room for people to get in😊 Price is high, but you expect it . The wheel takes about 30 minutes to go all the way around which gives us more time to enjoy the view, which is lovely. From the wheel you can see the boat cruise,the Buckingham palace and big Ben!  Definitely going again 😃",Book in advance for the discount
"April 13, 2022",The London eye is what you make of it. The views are second to none and I advise getting the Eye view planner so when you're up there you can point out the landmarks you're not aware of. I would advise that you book a ticket a week in advance to get advantage of the book early and get the discounted rate.,Thanks Jordan!
"April 13, 2022",So glad we made the time to go on the river cruise. Kids loved it and Jordan was a fantastic host making the experience funny and informative.,Very expensive
"April 13, 2022","We bought 4 standard tickets and only queued for around 20 mins. The queue moved quickly and I’m glad we didn’t buy fast track. In my opinion there were too many people in each capsule which restricts everybody’s view. It’s ok, but I think it’s very overpriced. £155 for a family is excessive. Wouldn’t do it again and I think there are better attractions for the cost.",Good views
"April 13, 2022",Had a beautiful trip round on the eye and saw wonderful views of the city. Well worth a visit we did come in the morning when it first opened so it was a little quieter. Staff were friendly.,Thames  trip 
"April 13, 2022","Brilliant our tour narrator Jordon was really clear , funny and information on all we could see well done Jordon  will recommend this tour to family and friends ",Jordan
"April 13, 2022",It was really interesting to hear the facts about london and the Thames. Jordan was exceptional with the guide information as well as making it enjoyable with jokes. I really enjoyed it,Great visit
"June 2, 2019",Fantastic views from the eye. Almost 20 years on it is just as good. The queuing was organised with polite staff who were organised to run a slick operation. Recommended for a visit to London don. Don’t forget to prebook to get a time slot.,Highest of Heights that Erase Fear
"June 1, 2019","As a joke I have always said that I am not afraid of heights, rather the sudden (expletive) stop. We fast tracked and skipped the line, got in/on the capsule within 10 minutes and spent the 30 minute ride reveling in the beauty that is the City of London. What ever you pay, it is well worth every penny!",Great Views from Above!
"June 1, 2019",This is a must do when in London. Great views all around and photo ops. I highly recommend getting the fast track tickets in advance as the lines are exceptionally long. We were able to hop right on with no wait what so ever.,Loved it!!!
"May 31, 2019",Not that keen on heights but LOVED it!!! Awesome view of the city. Big queues but moved very fast. Highly recommend.,Fantastic!
"May 31, 2019","What a fun experience.  The wheel rotates slowly enough so that you can get a wonderful view of London.  We had a great time.  The tickets are a bit expensive, but buying the Fast Track ticket was definitely worth it as it eliminated standing and waiting in a very, very long line.",Worth doing once 
"May 31, 2019","As expected the view of London is excellent. I was concerned that there would be too many people in the carriage and you couldn’t get a view but that wasn’t an issue, the carriages come round fast and they only have a little time to get people on them- so there was definitely enough viewing space and not too many people in each one. It really is the best way to get a glimpse of all of London if you haven’t seen it before. The only slight downside was the carriages are a bit old now and slightly smelly to be honest, they could use a proper clean daily. The 4d free experience was about what you’d expect for a free experience- nothing special, if you’re in a rush, don’t bother. The river cruise was excellent, again if you haven’t done it before, but I think it’s a very weather dependent thing. This is my second time and this time was sunny and it really improved everything, we sat up on the top deck and could see everything the guide was pointing at. Don’t be afraid to go down to the pier early though, as the queues get long quick and you’ll want to be on the top deck if it’s sunny! ",Crowded but alright
"May 30, 2019",Me and my husband went on the London Eye on 29/05/19 and although enjoyable it would have been better if it were less crowded. It was raining outside so the view was a little bleak and limited but we could still see majority of the landmarks nearby. The ‘pod’ we were in was freezing cold and the que to get on the attraction was long and fairly slow moving for saying how crowded the ‘pod’ was. I have previously been on the London Eye and it is much more enjoyable during quieter times.,"River Cruise, then the London Eye"
"May 29, 2019","I went on the River Cruise which was very informative (May 2019 so spring, but there was a chilly wind on the top, so ended up going downstairs for the balance of the cruise - do take a jacket).Then straight onto the Eye (I had pre-purchased my tickets so avoided the very long queues waiting to get on to the Eye). If I'd had to wait in the queue I may not have gone on it - but only due to my issues with heights, lol.  It was a beautiful day with views for miles & miles, amazing.  It does stop a few times but barely noticeable, so am guessing its for other visitors getting onto/off the pods.  Lots of photo opportunities & very friendly other visitors who helped this solo traveller with photos of proof.",Breathtaking Wheel over London
"May 29, 2019",The London Eye is a must do attraction in London! The waits are a bit steep so definitely arrive very early. It was a nice and relaxing lift above beautiful London. You will definitely get some great pics of Westminster Abbey and Big Ben from way above. The Aquarium is nearby and worth a visit if you have time.  ,So much fun...and the views!!
"May 28, 2019","What a fun attraction! The views are spectacular! We had a pretty good day to view the city too, not rainy or cloudy. Worth the time to do this ride.",London Eye afternoon visit

"June 4, 2019",First of all...purchase the tickets that bypass the long lines.  Also worth purchasing the book that includes a map of everything you will see as you go around...takes about 30 minutes.  ,A bit of a let down
"June 4, 2019","London eye is like one of the most iconic places when you think of London. And maybe because of that I was full of expectations when going into this. The service is okay, even With a line we got in fairly quickly, but it was kinda disappointing for me. The view was ok, almost the but not all that, for the money your paying you are there for half an hour, a bit stuck on the angles the capsules are at the moment. It ends kinda quickly and even though the view is nice it is kind of overpriced and super touristy, you're assaulted by memorabilia entering and leaving. Not awful but not the best experience...",Pleasant visit with my mother in law in her wheelchair

"June 3, 2019","Was very disappointed when i brought my 10 year old on a trip to the London Eye. We queued for about an hr to only be told there had been technical difficulties with the ride (which is understandable these things happen), we got a leaflet to say how to re-book, but unable to get a refund! As this was no fault of our own i believe we are entitled to a refund. i can not afford another trip to London or able to get time off work etc. The staff there were not very helpful as they would answer anyone's questions, We left very disappointed with our experience :(",On a clear day ...........
"June 3, 2019","On a clear day you can see all around you, so the song goes!  Wow the views are fantastic.  I found everyone on board willing to share the views from around the sides of the cabin as it moves very slowly and with no distinct shakes.  30 plus minutes of a fantasy world, we even saw the Guards practicing on Horse Guards Parade for the Trooping of the Colour.  The queues are typical winding sort, just like Disney, but they move quickly and the staff are incredible efficient at loading and loading.  Well worth the money but better to book tickets on line before hand.  There is also a Fast Track system available.  If the weather is hot do remember your bottle water and possibly hat. Your bags are checked before entering the line.",Great
"June 2, 2019",The London eye is great but only if you do the fast pass. No way I would stand in line for that long.,Good view

"May 15, 2019","I guess when sightseeing in London, this is on the to do list, however, the view from The Shard is far superior and from Sydney Tower and the Sands Sky Deck in Singapore etc As the title suggest, we paid for the London eye ticket through a tour company as an add on to a day tour. When lining up to get these pre booked ticket, I jumped at the chance to fast track. The line for both the ticket and then to board the eye was extensive. Worth the extra 10 pounds each. The ride was underwhelming I have to say and of all the attractions we visited in Europe and London, this was the least photographed. The weather was perfect but it was almost disappointing. If you are time poor and you miss this one, it is not the end of the world. Perhaps the evening ride is more captivating?",Worth a go 
"May 14, 2019",Had a great time. The views are amazing. It’s exspensive for what it is though. Very high security which is amazing. Just found it a little boring! This was my 2nd time showing a mate. Cool experience but you can go up any building in London & get the same view. ,London's iconic sky line

"May 13, 2019",Would really recommend the London Eye. This was my second time on it and I loved it just as much as the first time. Those in our group who had not been on it before were very impressed. The weather was lovely so the views were great. ,Online tickets 
"May 13, 2019","I was surprised to see that after we bought tickets online (London eye + Tower bridge) that we needed to get the ‘real’ tickets. So we needed to wait in a queue for that, and it took us a lot of time to get back to the Wheel and stand in line again. View is beautiful, must see, but I don’t see the point in buying tickets online (that was cheaper, must admit!), and then getting there and standing in queue to get those bought tickets cause printouts are not valid","Expensive, slow but a must do."
"May 12, 2019",The London Eye is a must do and I'd not a thrill ride but at times it's slowness is boring. It's also expensive.,Didn't do it for me... 
"May 12, 2019","It's one of those things to experience while in London but if you don't enjoy being locked into a small pod with a large group of strangers, find another way to check out the skyline. I used vouchers to drastically reduce the ticket price but had I paid face value I'd have been greatly disappointed. Queues moved faster than I expected to get on and although photos were taken there was no sales pitch. Do be aware that there is an airport style bag search before you get on. ",Good view of the city
"May 11, 2019",Great view of the city but the shard offers much better view and later viewing. The eye has a fast moving line but is hit and miss of who is on your pod. We had a bunch of rude people pushing to get in and off and standing in front of people trying to sit and view. When asked to move completely ignored. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Would not ride again but should do at least once.,Great Location
"May 23, 2019","I think the view would be amazing from the London Eye, were it not for the fact that they close super early (8:30 pm), which sadly, I missed. Also strange to me was that the gift shop also closed at that time. So ixnay on buying souvenirs there. Best bet is to pre-order your tickets and get there by sunset. ",Expensive but Unforgettable 
"May 23, 2019","This really is one of the must-do things in London, as long as you can afford it. It’s certainly not cheap - £30 for an adult and not much less for a four-year-old when we visited, similar to the Shard - but it’s hard to beat as a way of seeing the city from up on high.You get a 30-minute ride taking you up above the Thames with unparalleled views of Parliament and the surrounding area. You’re able to move around within the capsule - something our four-year-old loved as she went from side to side taking it all in. She picked it out as the best thing we did in London when we got home. ","Glad I did it but it is just a Ferris wheel, after all."
"May 21, 2019","It seems as though one has to go on the Eye, and I am not sorry that I did.  However, it is just as expected.  It is easy to get a ticket and the line was not very long (I did not pay extra for the fast track).",Great Way to Begin a London Trip
"May 21, 2019",This is the perfect spot to begin a trip to London. It’s a great opportunity to really orient yourself with the city and get a different perspective of many of the famous sites in London.  This is well worth the ~1-2 hours it takes to complete.,amazing views
"May 21, 2019","This attraction lasts 30 minutes. The views are wonderful, due to the location right by big ben, Thames river, parliament, etc.",View of the river and London
"May 21, 2019","This was our second time in London, but the first time we jumped on the Eye.  Wow, it was something else!  It doesn't not spin real fast, so you have plenty of time to see the sights around the Thames River. A must do if you have time.",Amazing ride
"May 21, 2019",A ride of the london eye that too in rain.... just simply amazing.... though it might be an understatement. Do get the fast track ticket to avoid the queue and save time.,Brilliant on a clear day
"May 20, 2019","We got very lucky with the weather, clear sunny day and could see for miles.   Great way to pick out the various sights from the top of the wheel. It moves nice and slowly so plenty of time to see all the sights. If the weather is clear its a Must do attraction when in London.",Fun
"May 20, 2019",This was so much fun to get on during the day but at night the view is amazing. Must get on when visiting London. ,Beautiful View
"May 20, 2019","We went the perfect time of year!  The weather was beautiful and there was minimal waiting time.  The cruise was fantastic.  Our guide, Victoria, was energetic and quite informative.  What a great experience!",Good experiencd
"May 7, 2019","We bought our tickets online about an hour before we went, we had chosen a time slot but they didn’t seem too strict on the times chosen 👌 I got a student ticket which was £16 I think and my friends paid £27 for standard adult tickets. Enjoyable activity and the kids in the pod that was behind us seemed to have a great time with the group they were with. We were placed in a pod of about 12/14 people all other small groups of adults. Took about 40 mins in total. Wouldn’t recommend the 4D experience, more of a history of the London eye. ",Fantastic views of London
"May 7, 2019","We were lucky to visit at Easter when the weather was perfect.Luckily we had pre-booked so had no real line as such.The vista was stunning and there were plenty opportunities for photos, even with a full capsule.Book well in advance and try to organise the weather!!!",Not adventurous but it is something to try
"May 7, 2019",First time in London and I had to try the wheel. You will get to see London from the top which is a beautiful view. I am from a small area in Canada so this was an experience for me in London. Try it,Long queues - But a must visit
"May 7, 2019",Long queues - but you moment will come to step inside on of the capsules and enjoy the 360 degree views of London. ,London Eye
"May 7, 2019","Had a good time riding the London Eye, staff was friendly and the views was fantastic.  The lines to ride were long, but worth the wait.  It takes approximately 30 minutes to make a complete revolution.",A topspot - literally and figuratively speaking
"May 6, 2019","Our daughter wanted to go up in the Eye and I assumed it would be a total waste of time. It wasn't. It turned out to be the fastest 45 minutes I've been through. So much to see, amazing. Strongly recommended. ","Excellent views of the city.  A very touristy ""must do"""
"May 6, 2019","Its our family's first trip to London so we had to ride the Eye.  Its a big Ferris wheel but you are enclosed in a glass and metal ""pod"" that fits about 15 or so people so its not a small thing you'd see at an amusement park.  The lines can get LONG but the Fast Track is totally worth it.  It cut the wait time to maybe 3 minutes on a weekday afternoon.Pick a clear day (we did that) or try it at night for another perspective of London.  it doesn't move fast so plenty of time to look around as you go around for 1 loop.",Incredible views!
"May 6, 2019","You need to do the London Eye if you're visiting London.  You will see the most incredible, breathtaking views!  You can stand and/or sit in the compartment, and the line to actually get on may look long, but only takes about a half hour to get through.","A cool experience, but WAYYYY overpriced!"
"May 6, 2019","My family of 2 adults and 3 young kids enjoyed our trip on the Eye, but I still don't think it's worth the price tag for a family like ours. It cost the equivalent of almost $170 USD to take one 25-minute turn on the thing, which I think is INSANE.  Children's tickets are barely less than the adult fare, so it really adds up quickly. The process to buy the tickets and get on the wheel was super smooth and quick, no hiccups. I would recommend NOT buying the fast-entry tickets until you get there and see how long the regular line is. We went at around 10:30 in the morning and there was a very short line for the regular entry, and it moved quickly. The people who had paid more for the fast lane had wasted even more money. I was told by several people and guides that a better option would be to go to the bar in the Shard (which is one or two floors below the observation deck) and order a drink, and enjoy the fantastic view over the city from there. It will cost you like 60 % less, and you'll get a drink out of it.",VIP Experience phenomenal. Non-VIP waits were 3 hours!
"May 5, 2019","We bought a chocolate tasting VIP experience so we were able to walk right on at our appointed time and get two times around. Otherwise, lines were estimated at 3 hours wait for one time around. Our experience was phenomenal, very comfortable and phenomenal views of the city and the Thames.",Incredible views!

"May 5, 2019",We expect a lot and we left the EYE wondering if it worth it.I recommend to visit it on sunny days and only if you have some free time.,Do the champagne tour
"May 5, 2019","We booked the champagne tour the day before. It was great since it was a dedicated time slot (we didn't have to wait in line) and there was a guide in the box. She was friendly, helped us take pictures when at the top, and pointed out various points of interest on the skyline. Plus champagne toast! Totally worth the extra 5 quid or whatever. ",Lovely experience 
"May 4, 2019",It’s was a great experience. We had merlin passes and we could go in the fast track lane which was a bonus. ,Eye see...
"May 4, 2019","The line is usually long but this time we got lucky we only has to wait 10 mins, I've sometimes known for it to take hours. The view is fantastic as you can see most of the attractions and iconic buildings from an amazing view. terrific photo opportunity of the landscape, the Big Ben was having some work done so it wasn't visible clearly but still a great observation point of the city.",Not to miss
"May 3, 2019",I booked this activity online with get my guide and really enjoyed it. The waiting queue wasn't very long even with our regular tickets. Then we entered with ~ 20 people which was not a problem since the cabin was large enough . We had an amazing view of the city. I think the tour lasted ~25 minutes before we got outDefinitely go for it,Tourist attraction must see
"May 3, 2019","This of course is on the list of must do while in London.  Be sure to purchase the ""fast pass"" as you walk to the front of the line and don't have to queue. ",Cool experience
"May 2, 2019","Everyone should do this once on a visit to London.  I would definitely recommend the fast track ticket especially during busy times.   The view is great, and initially everyone is at the windows snapping pictures, then the second half everyone seeks to kind of settle in and relax just enjoying the view.   Overall a London must but once is enough.",Superb views!
"May 1, 2019","This is one attraction not to be missed! We bought fast track tickets, well worth paying the extra, there wasn't much of a queue when w e arrived but by the end of the ride, the queues were full of school and your groups, it would have taken hours to get through. The views are quite amazing and you are so close to the city which is just over the river. The ride was clean, comfortable and was just the right amount of time. I would highly recommend the London Eye!","Pleasant, but expensive, and felt crowded."
"April 30, 2019",It wasn't the best view of London - and not the most exciting experience you'll have either.  I would skip it and save time and money.,Exciting
"April 29, 2019","If you plan to see and photograph London at night, ride the London eye during autumn or winter season when the nights are longer. We went on the last trip which was 8 pm (23 April) and it was still bright so no nightscape for me to take, plus Big Ben was covered in scaffolding so really nothing interesting that day. The views would've been magnificent if everything was the way I imagined it. Also, buy tickets at the counter and NOT to those men outside the ticketing who are authorized sellers but will also rip you off! ",Eyeing the Sunset...
"April 28, 2019","Timed our ride on the London Eye to coincide with sunset.  We were a few of the fortunate ones for the day we enjoyed this activity, as we were able to catch the ride at sunset and the weather was perfect.  Views all around were nice, making this somewhat of an 'eye-conic' experience.  A bit pricey, but now off my bucket list !",Went with kids
"April 28, 2019","Nice view but very high price to take 2 kids for 30 min ride to see London. The queues were not bad. The photo from London Eye cost me another £20. I think at least child ticket should be much cheaper, they can’t go by themselves anyway.",Views like you've never experienced before!
"April 27, 2019",So much fun and fantastic photos too!  You truly get to see it all from up here - all the way to the horizon!  ,Good option 
"April 27, 2019",A little expensive for a 30 minutes ride but it’s worth it if you want to see london from the skies. ,Fast pass tickets are worth it
"April 26, 2019","Even though supposedly it opens at 10 according to the website, we got on at 915 and I think it was going before that. Fast Pass not only gets you in another (much shorter) line, it also gets you in a car with only other Fast Pass holders. So we had 5 people in our car, while we saw other cars that were packed. ","Great Views, Do the Fast Pass"
"April 25, 2019","The views from the London Eye are fantastic. The car moves so slowly, the motion is almost imperceptible. Also, the car is so big that it doesn't feel crowded. One thing, though: We bought the anytime that day fast pass. It's nearly double the price of a basic ticket, but it's worth every pence. The line for regular ticket holders was so long, the workers had to route it across the walkway and into another holding area. I couldn't even see the whole line until I was up in the Eye. It wouldn't have surprised me if the wait was two hours. We, on the other hand, walked nearly right up to the door, with a total wait time of less than five minutes. So go, but only if you do the fast pass.",Once is enough. I would not repeat this experience.
"April 25, 2019","We went with the family through this experience and it was kind of lame. You get to see some of the famous London sights from above, but overall I was not impressed.",Dusk
"April 13, 2019","20:15. Great time to do this, tesco voucher codes. Arrival and security very good, clean windows.  Offical Photo expensive 25 quid or 20 for 1",London Eye
"April 12, 2019",It’s worth a visit but it’s quite pricey. Great views for Westminster and area. It’s definitely quite nice for tourists!,Great views
"April 12, 2019","Has to be done when you are visiting london a must and great views of the city, would recommend buying the london pass to sealife also.",Worth the wait
"April 11, 2019","Whether you climb aboard during the day or at night, this really is an unforgettable experience. It's a wait and a hassle to board, but the stunning views really are worth it. Book in advance, if you can. ",Great views of the city 
"April 9, 2019",We just loved the views of the city from the London Eye.  We got some great pictures of the city. The line was a little long but it moved pretty quickly.  ,Surprisingly enjoyable
"April 7, 2019","I thought this was a decent experience, it’s kind of fun being in a capsule that holds upwards of 30 people (although they only put in 15 or so). It’s not that scary if you’re afraid of heights (no glass floor and it moves very slowly) but next time I think I’ll try a view from the Shard instead. It’s technically a little less expensive and you also technically get more time “on top” to view and explore the city. Not having visited the Shard, I’m inclined to think it’s a better way to go between the London Eye and Shard for views of the city. I assume the queues for the Eye are longer than for the Shard.",Nice view
"April 7, 2019",Lovely experience. We also had the 4d short movie and we loved it. I reccomend taking the fast track ticket its really worth it,Get fast track tickets
"April 6, 2019",The experience was underwhelming for what I was expecting. It’s not included in London Pass. We were going to go Saturday evening around 6pm but the lines were ridiculous. We bought fast track tickets for the next day for 4:30 pm. We arrived at 4pm and were on the Eye within 15 minutes. If we had been in the regular line it would have been over an hour wait. The views were cool but not as awesome as the Shard views in my opinion. ,Where’s the air conditioning?
"April 6, 2019","Big money from a sponsor from Atlanta (coca cola), so why is the pod so stuffy, hot and claustrophobic?  Good views, even with Big Ben under refurbishment.",I rode on this
"April 6, 2019","When I was in London I did this because it was really close to my hotel and I thought it would be fun.  I bought tickets and they let us get on.  Then we went around in a circle and we could look down at the ground and see things.  They look different from in the air and you can see a long way when you are on the top.  We thought it was fun and we liked doing this.  It cost a lot of money for one ride though, but I guess that is okay.  I think you should ride this because it is fun and you can see a lot of things and a lot of places when you are on the top.  ",Amazing views
"March 31, 2019","The views at night were lovely. Lines were long,  but moved very quickly.  Several in our party were afraid of heights and had no problem as the ride was quite smooth and spacious. 360 degree views were available in the car.  Lovely experience,  but a bit pricey for the length of experience.  ",first visit
"March 30, 2019",try to get early morning ride as the eye gets busy as day goes on. the 4D experience you can experience is good if you not sure what to expect really enjoyed it,Go for the Fastpass
"March 30, 2019","40 pounds was worth avoiding the lines, I was surprised how busy it was in late March.  The ride last about 30 minutes, there are about 25 people in the car with you so it isn’t too crowded, but definitely not cheap.  ",Cantilevered Observation Wheel
"March 29, 2019","The Coca-Cola London Eye, according to Wikipedia, “is a cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London.” The article goes on: “It is Europe’s tallest cantilevered observation wheel, is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over 3.75 million visitors annually, and has made many appearances in popular culture.”By the description from Wikipedia, it seemed that my family’s visit to this hopping place was a must. When we were in London, we got on the London Eye, and enjoyed the novelty aspect of the wonderful cantilevered observation wheel that was situated so conveniently close to our hotel. The cantilevered observation wheel is also commonly referred to as a “Ferris wheel.” I believe that is what the kids call it these days anyway.The London Eye is across the River Thames from Big Ben. Unfortunately, at the time of our visit to the UK, Big Ben, which is likely an iconic sight from the cantilevered observation wheel, was under construction. This impeded on our ability to attain full enjoyment of the views of London, but didn’t put so much of a damper on our experience of the cantilevered observation wheel that it was to the extent that it destructed our enjoyment time of the cantilevered observation wheel. There were still many sights to soak in, and the London Eye moves along at a slow enough pace for you to enjoy taking pictures and getting a kick out of the other fun and exciting things to do in a gondola.You should go here.",LOndon Eye

"March 26, 2019",Definitely worth going. It is a must if you’re in London. If you buy tickets online it is way cheaper plus you choose the time frame so you can avoid big queues. ,Loved it
"March 25, 2019",Went for anniversary. Unfortunately it was a bit foggy in the day we went so didn’t see everything but was a good experience. Didn’t wait too long in the que and good good priced photos at the end. ,Recommendations to visit
"March 24, 2019",Very fast going queue has surprised-after last visit couple years ago thought it would take at least an hour but we skiped in 15 min,Fab tour from a true cockney!
"January 5, 2022",What a great way to finish off my trip to London! Although it was chilly (typical January weather) the sun was shining and our tour guide Mick made the journey enjoyable with his witty sense of humour. The tour covered many attractions with lots of history and interesting facts. During the tour the boat does a 360 turn where you catch a brilliant view of Tower Bridge (sit on the left hand side for the best view). I’d 100% do this tour again! Thank you :),London Eye and the river cruise - both absolute musts
"January 5, 2022","Miraculously, we managed to come on a lovely (but cold) sunny day, so the views and visibility from the top of the London eye were even more incredible than we could have imagined. Well worth the wait in the queue, or through the fast track if you're so inclined. The Thames River cruise was especially enjoyable, made even more worthwhile by our fantastic tour guide, Mick, who was clearly very knowledgeable about the surrounding area as well as making the whole experience memorable with his light hearted quips and passenger interaction. Overall, this is an absolute must if you have a couple of hours free during your visit, and the river cruise especially was at a steal of a price for the great value provided. Kudos to all involved, and a special shout out to Mick and the rest of the crew.",Absolutely must do!
"January 5, 2022",Absolutely Amazing! Our tour guide Mick was the best! This was our first time in London so we thought this would be a good way to see what there is. The riverboat cruise was extremely informative and entertaining thanks to our amazing tour guide Mick who made the trip even better! No complaints whatsoever and it is definitely worth doing for the price! We will definitely be doing this again when we come back to London!,Fantastic

"January 4, 2022","Lovely views, great experience, seemingly a good standard of security, loved it. Would definitely recommend and would definitely go back again.",Always a Treat
"January 3, 2022","We booked for sunset time on NYE. It was beautiful, a nice slow turn where you can see everything. Not the fault of the staff because they are not in the pod, but too many stupid people took off their masks immediately, putting everyone in a confined area at risk. Again, that was on them, not the London Eye. ",Amazing guide
"January 2, 2022",Amazing tour guide. Rich information with fun comments making it an enjoyable journeyKids loved it and said this was the best tour ever,Good experience!
"January 2, 2022",The experience was nice! You will have a great view of the Big Ben and the Parliament. The students can book a bit cheaper tickets via studentbeans.,A great way to see the city
"January 1, 2022","My girlfriend had some vouchers for Virgin experiences and it seemed a good way to do this without 'paying' the high prices (£98 in vouchers for four adults).  We got there mid afternoon on friday and walked straight to the pod and shared it with just two other people, which was ideal. The ride is smooth and you (stating the obvious) get really high, giving a great view of the houses of parliament in particular as well as out over the city.It's not something I will do again, but I am pleased that I did do it and it was a pleasant way to spend 30 or so minutes.",Evening Visit to see the Christmas Lights
"January 1, 2022","I have done the eye several times, but always in the day and during warmer weather.  Wanted to see London at night. It was spectacular.  We'd book the last time of the day, but arrived early and were allowed on without any problem. Shared our pod with 4 other adults and 3 children. It was very comfortable and safe. Lovely ride as always. And beautiful views across London. ",Book The Champagne Experience - Totally worth it!
"November 13, 2018","I highly recommend booking the Champagne Experience. I read reviews that said it wasn't worth it and you had to stand in line anyways, etc, etc. so we were hesitant. However, while sipping champagne in the lounge we realized just how long the regular line is and we were so glad that we did not have to stand in it. When it was our time, we were escorted to the faster line, went straight to bag check and were on a pod in less than 5 minutes. Totally worth it! Plus we had a champagne cart and knowledgeable employee in the pod with us who could tell us what we were seeing and answer questions.",This is a must when you are in London

"November 11, 2018",You should book your tickets online to save a bit but mostly to make sure that you can still get one. They are often sold out. Overall it’s a tad expensive but the view is very nice and the cabins are kept in good shape,Cool Ride
"November 11, 2018",Went up and was able to see the city on a clear day. Wasn’t sure when we would be able to go so we bought tickets on site. Ticket line was long but nobody noticed the kiosks to buy the tickets. We used the machine and saved 20 minutes. Would do again ,A fine one-time experience
"November 10, 2018","You might do it once. However, the lines on a busy day (we were there on a Saturday) were overwhelmingly long, the information was unclear as to where lines started and the lines seem unmanaged. Because the lines were so long, we opted to do fast-track, paying extra to reserve a time slot. We only found out later we should have been asked if we had a day travelcard - which we did - to save 30%. Instead, we paid almost 40 pounds per ticket per adult. That's a pretty steep bill. Was it worth it? Yes and no. The view at times is spectacular -- but there is no onboard guide or recording to provide information as to just what you're looking at. We had someone with us who could guide us, so that helped. If your airplane flies near central London, you might have a nice view also - without paying extra fees and dealing with the lines. Put it this way: if you have the time, energy and cash to burn, go ahead. A better value was the River Cruise -- for 12 pounds, you see all major London bridges and you have a funny guide who provides great information as to what you're looking at.",Well run attraction
"November 7, 2018","Easy online process for booking tickets. Big queue on arrival but they keep the whole thing moving along and the pods aren't overly crowded. Great views of the city and for those who hate heights it is very smooth, solid feeling and reassuring. I think that given two tickets cost £50 that it is simply greed to ask for another £25 for photos that literally took 10 seconds to capture. ",London eye

"November 5, 2018",The Eye is terrific ... though long queues are horrific ... purchase your tickets online before you go.  Depending on the weather ... you get great views over London all the way to Windsor Castle.  It can be a relaxing 30 minute ride.,EASY AND CONVENIENT  WAY TO GENTLY HOVER ABOVE THE SIGHTS OF LONDON
"September 5, 2018",The slow turn of this giant wheel with its dangling glass gondolas is the perfect way to hover above the Thames  with delightful views of some of London's most famous sites. If you can time it for just after sunset with a dark blue sky and the building and street lights coming on its a magical flight.,Dissatisfied 
"September 5, 2018",Had a wedding gift of the vip experience for our honeymoon. Booking was for 6pm. Arrived at 5.40pm in the eye lounge only to be told we can't have a drink because the bar closes at 5.30. What's the point if vip experience goes on after 5.30? Disappointing. ,Good Experience 
"September 2, 2018",It was a great experience. If it’s your first time to visit London I think it’s a good idea to visit London eye.,Fun fun fun! 
"September 1, 2018",The London Eye was so fun. You can see the entire City. The ride is about 30 minutes. We absolutely loved it! ,best view of the city you can get
"August 30, 2018","Buy your tickets ahead of time. You still have a wait in line but not as long as if you don't. The compartments are large and completely Murano glass, with benches to sit on as you go around. There are 4 stations in each compartment with info on each of the changing landmarks you can see from the compartment as it turns. Totally worth doing.",Spectacular views of the city
"August 28, 2018","Visited with relatives from overseas. We booked online in advance and arrived about 15 minutes before we were due to go up.  After a short wait we were able to join the queue which moved quite fast despite it being a very busy Saturday in July.  The capsules are large and airy and they move slightly Way enough that there is plenty of opportunity to move around and see the views in different directions.  It would be nice if there were information boards in the capsules to tell you what you are seeing but there was nothing.  The views are spectacular and fortunately we know enough of London to point out most major landmarks.  After the trip on he Eye we went inside the visitor centre to see the 4D film.  I was a little disappointed that you had to stand for this as we'd been on our feet for quite a few hours by this point.  The film is quite good but not a major selling point in my opinion.  This is a must do attraction for visitors who don't come to London often - probably best dine near the start of a holiday to help you get your bearings.  Like all Merlin attractions, you have to exit via the gift shop and photos are pushed upon you at every opportunity but it is easy enough to say no.",Nice westminister view and overall London
"August 28, 2018","We paid more to get an express tickets ; it was worth it to skip the long lines , even we were visiting in January.  Ice view from top",Super Rhona
"August 27, 2018","When you pay only £41 pp and end up with only the two of you in a cabin, you know you kinda won the lottery!We enrolled for the Champaign Experience and we were so lucky to have Rhona as our host! This smart and funny young woman explained us what we were looking at from the sky, combining facts with humour.The champaign (Pommery) was very good, the view was nice, the weather was okay.To be recommended!",Get the fast track
"August 27, 2018","We are glad to have purchased the fast track pass. The queues for the standard ticket holders were very long. We got in line and were immediately placed in a pod. The ride takes about 20 minutes. The views of the city were okay. Maybe the views are more enjoyable if viewed at night. It's worth doing for photo ops, but otherwise a little boring.",Super visit
"August 27, 2018","Had a super trip to London eye. Great experience, organised queues, friendly staff and security spot on. Lovely views of london. Kids loved it and smiled all the way thru",Great
"November 1, 2021",There was lots of people in the capsule and it was hard to get a picture but the view definitely makes up for it. The queue is quite long so you should expect to stand in line for around 20-25 minutes before you get on,Amazing
"November 1, 2021",Great experience. Lovely staff. Amazing view of the London eye and all the bridges in the sun. Very highly recommended if you ever come to London.,So flaming epic. 
"October 31, 2021","I arrived totally apprehensive and unaware that I'd have to share a pod with 26 or so other people. I spoke to one of the staff about my fears and said I had sound sensitivity which is the worst and he spoke to the boss and got me a private pod and even queued with me. Once up I felt amazing and the views were epic so glad I did it. But if they tell you, you can't feel the pod rotating don't believe them you can but its not too bad its like going over a bridge makes your tummy go woosh. Highly recommend it. ",A trip not to be missed
"October 31, 2021","The boat was perfect, we were able to sit outside. Our granddaughter who was 6 really enjoyed it. Jordan made the trip fun for kids but informative enough for adults dropping in some adult humour along the way. We couldn’t have asked for more.",Really enjoyable! Jordan made the trip!
"October 31, 2021",We thoroughly enjoyed the river cruise. Jordan was excellent and really made the trip! He was very knowledgeable and delivered the information in a jovial manner. I would definitely recommend this cruise! There is an option for both indoor and outdoor seating :),Loved it
"October 31, 2021","Had a good trip with Rosie ,who told us all we needed to no about the river side history,building,,bridge s ect,ect ,good trip keep up the good work ,it was a lovely day ,the sun was out TOP tip wrap up ,😁😁😁","Great service, amazing views and fun details"
"October 30, 2021",We had an amazing experience with Rosie on the River Cruise tour. She provided so much value and interesting historical details with an amazing sense of humor. She made our River cruise tour amazing. It makes the experience so much better where I did not expect much from to be honest. So Definitely recommend it!,Family visit
"October 30, 2021",Really enjoyed the birds eye view of central London.  Very well run  . Very clean and the queues move very quickly would visit again!,Well worth going
"October 30, 2021","We went after the London Eye,it's literally next to it, great value for money and very entertaining and interesting guide from Jordan, a brilliant way to see some of the Riverside sights in London, well worth adding on to your London Eye trip.",Brilliant time had by the whole family
"October 30, 2021",Oh Wow!! Wow!! Wow!! We had such a great time on this river sightseeing cruise. My young boys absolutely loved it. Our guide Jordan was funny and very informative. He had great knowledge and made the while thing really enjoyable for all of us. Definitely recommend.,Great views on a sunny day
"October 14, 2018",Worth seeing.  Very busy but if you want spend the money for the fast track ticket.  We didn't see the other sites associated with it.  Well organized.,Excellent experience
"October 11, 2018","We simply walked up and there was no wait. however, in hindsight, I wish we purchased tickets in advance for a reduced price. Still worth it!",Beautiful view of London!
"October 11, 2018","The London eye was a fun family adventure to go on! It’s about 30 minutes to see the views of the London skyline... and, it’s very pretty. Would recommend for families to do!",London eye
"October 8, 2018","Smashing experiance with great views even in the rain. Large queue for tickets in ticket office, but you do get on to the eye very quickly. ",Go after sunset to avoid the crowds
"October 7, 2018",We had a gift card to use for the London eye and originally went during the day - however we found the pods were fairly full and the queues were long - so we decide to book a time slot in the evening so we could enjoy a view overlooking London when it  is lit up beautifully! And it was definitely worth the wait - our pod only had me and my partner and one other couple in it so we weren’t all trying to get the best spot. Going in the evening is perfect for anybody who would like to go on the London eye and experience this attraction who has already already enjoyed a view overlooking London already (a free option is to visit the Sky Garden),Disappointed & Insulted
"October 5, 2018","We booked online for the Eye and from the start were disappointed with the whole experience. First, the staff insisted on a printed ticket which we were unable to supply as we were travelling from overseas and staying in an apartment with no printing facilities. We were directed by staff to what seemed the 'usual' place people in our situation were sent about a 1/2 km away to then pay a further £3 to have the ticket printed. Once we returned to the line, we were then told by another attendant that we were in the wrong line for the ticket type we had and had to join another queue! Once we got on the Eye we were further disappointed by the lack of commentary and/or signage in the capsule pointing out the landmarks. The capsules contained no information other than Coca Cola signage and we were then insulted with the request at the end to stand in the Photo zone and ""don't forget to smile"" in order to take another photo to sell to us!  I would not recommend the London Eye to anyone - it is not worth the money and hassle. You can get as good, if not better views, from other areas of the city for free without the insults.",London view!
"October 5, 2018",It’s a nice way to have a view from above of the whole London. The wheel is moving slowly so you have enough time to enjoy and see the view!,London Eye - negotiate with someone in the next pod to exchange photos!
"October 3, 2018","We were quickly on-board. It's a marvellous piece of engineering. The pods stay on the outside at all times - cool!After some sign language with a couple in the next pod, we took some photos of them in their pod, then exchanged them when back on the ground.",Nice view and cool engineering
"October 2, 2018","While not a cheap 20 minute ride it is a great view and the structure is quite impressive.  I’m not sure it is a “don’t miss” in London as there are other view options such as the Shard or restaurants in the shard, but not a waste of time.",Good Idea
"October 2, 2018",This line for the London Eye can be quite long.  It was worth the effort ($) to get the ticket to avoid spending time in line,Too expensive
"September 26, 2018",On a clear day you can see all of London. But for the cost it just wasn’t worth it. Go to the walkie talkie building and go to the roof top garden for free. ,You can not miss it
"September 25, 2018",The London eye is massive. You can not miss it as you see it from everywhere along the river. It's a memory you will never forget.,Great views of London
"September 25, 2018","The Eye is a very nice way to see the setting sun in London.  Each capsule holds around 12 people, but it was still spacious to get many pictures.",Avoid in poor weather
"September 24, 2018","There is a lot of hype about the London Eye, but really it doesn't live up to it and it is very expensive. You don't get much out of a second visit and if the weather is poor and visibility reduced it may feel a waste of time.","Great, but expensive "
"September 22, 2018","Fabulous views of London, and a great opportunity to point out different landmarks and historical places to my children. The price, for 30 minutes entertainment, is too high. We got a discount for traveling there by train, but £27 for an adult and £22 per child is crazy. Also, they took a souvenir photo before getting on the ride, but at the end we discovered that only the tops of my children’s heads were visible! I would have expected them to know how to adjust the lens to capture children!",Mark is the best !!
"September 22, 2018","The cruise in itself is fun, but with Mark’s (tour guide) comments, it brings the experience to a whole new level ! ",The views can't be beaten elsewhere
"September 19, 2018","Ok, totally touristy but so worth the fantastic view on London. I would opt to do this around sunset so that you can see the city lights popping up under a sunset sky.",Another must go in london
"September 18, 2018",The only thing that can ruin this nice experience is waiting in queues to buy the tickets. Go for the fast track way,Ask for Marian
"September 17, 2018","We booked the champagne experience / fast track. It was strange as we could not claim our ticket by the machines which were very fast, we had to queue up by the vip desk which took ages due a difficult client, and due the fact that only one person worked, the other was socialising and entertaining a group of young girls.We have been advised to go to the lounge and wait for the hostess to come. The lounge is very small and it was very uncomfortable for us as there was a large wedding party and we were just sitting in the corner in our “normal clothes” the drink menu is rather pricy as well, so I would rather skip this bit if we return.Our hostess Marian was amazing, very bubbly but not over the top, very knowledgable and lovely personality. She couldn’t do enough for us when it came to photographs, answering questions and so on. On our tour we had 17 people in our group which was fine, wasn’t too crowded and we had great opportunities to make photos.",Rode the London Eye
"September 16, 2018",Perfect day weather wise so I rode the eye.  Surprised it was only £27 for an adult ride.  Only a 10 min wait to get on.  Ride took about 20-25 min.  Great views if the weather is good.  Come early.  No lines right at 10am.  ,Great sights at such a height!
"September 16, 2018","It was an enjoyable and picturesque experience. The duration of the London eye is a good amount of time. We bought tickets for two attractions and we skipped the lines for both, which made the whole experience better. ",Beautiful views
"September 15, 2018","Went here on a clear day, lovely views, plenty of room for everyone. Didn’t like all of the touristy trappings as you wait, but fun! Kids love it. ",Superb
"September 15, 2018","If you have time to do just one thing when you go to London, this is the one to choose. Good vale, world class venue",Great views 
"September 14, 2018",Great views of everywhere around London. Very smooth ride would barely notice you’re moving. Be careful of what time you book your slot for as queues can be very long. ,Great views!
"September 14, 2018",I really wasn’t interested in this but my husband wanted to do it. I was pleasantly surprised. The birds eye view was really great! The time allotted was just right. We had a great perspective. I suggest doing this at the start of your visit so you know what the layout of the city is.,Fun place to visit
"September 13, 2018",We rented  bikes and rode around the London Eye area.  It was such a nice friendly area to visit. Lots of nice restaurants.,Awesome views and photo ops.
"September 13, 2018",We went during a pretty busy time and we only waited for about 5-10 minutes. The ride gave plenty of time to look around and take pictures. Definitely a must if visiting London!,Wedding treat
"September 13, 2018","My husband booked for a champagne flight for 2. We arrived at 1600 to be informed we had missed the flight and we needed to be there 10-15 mins before toCheck in. So we headed to check in and was told we had to pay £10 admin fee - wasn’t happy about this and have filled out complaint letter - if they had highlighted this in email we could have done it! One thing it did say was bring ID - which we did but were not asked for it - so if u have set conditions u need to stick by them all - not just pick and chose!!!Anyway, that issue aside we enjoyed the flight. Nice to see the city. Felt it very strange that we had a child on the flight - I know he wasn’t drinking however having a champagne flight it would be nice to have adults only as not everyone likes children! Luckily the lad was well behaved but had he not of been we wouldn’t have been very impressed! Worth booking VIP to avoid the long Q’sChampagne was nice (one glass) and the host was informative. But strange that she had to bump her “bar” down several steps to the wheel....but luckily no explosions! We didn’t have picture taken when we went in - which others seem to have done. And the photo taken towards the end of the flight was of us and some other random people that couldn’t be cropped out so we didn’t buy it which was a shame as we could of liked a momento. ",Worth the wait
"September 13, 2018",London eye is a must if you visiting London. Do not be deterred by the que it moves fairly fast. Try to buy the package deals for all your attractions such as London dungeons etc. It works out much cheaper,Line Moves Quickly
"September 13, 2018","Although very commercialized, the Eye does give you a great perspective of London.  The line moves quite quickly as they load 20-25 people into each capsule. ","Expensive alone, buy a combo ticket"
"July 25, 2018","A really nice experience and great way to view the London City skyline.  It is best value to buy online, get a priority ticket, reserve your time, plus combine it with another site you want to see (we combined with Madame Tussaud’s).  There is a lot of construction going on and one might be concerned that the view towards, London Bridge will soon be totally obscured, but the views of Westminster will still and always be there.  It’s a bit if a more interesting way to see London from up above than simply going to the top of a building.  ",Eye-spy With My London Eye ......
"July 25, 2018","My husband organised this visit to London for us on a gorgeously hot Saturday. We were most impressed with the organisational skills of the staff on the day. Yes, there were queues, but the timescales which were communicated were true to time. Good to know if, like us, you have other organised time activity slots.The view over London is spectacular, the rotation lasts approximately half an hour, lots of space to stand or sit and take in the sight-seeing views.",Unforgettable experience
"July 24, 2018",Amazing views of London Town.The capsule wasn't at all cramped so plenty of room for viewing the sights and photo taking.Can get very busy so get in early.,Over rated not worth the money 
"July 24, 2018",Wouldn’t rush back to this . It was mediocre at best and boring at worst. It would have been helpful for an audio guide to talk through London skyline . Que system was a joke . If you are limited in time / money give this attraction a miss .,Very smooth experience
"July 24, 2018","We went right at dinnertime on a Monday, so perhaps that was a good time to go, but the line didn't look hours long at all. I paid for FastTrack, however, and it seemed well worth it as we were on a pod within 10 minutes easy. The view is fabulous (I just wish the glass had been a bit cleaner, though I suppose that's difficult in a place where it rains nearly every day). The ride is so smooth that sometimes I didn't even know we were moving unless I looked at the ground or the center.",Must do
"July 23, 2018","It’s the London Eye!  Just one of those things you have to do.  We bought tickets a couple of days prior in the ticket office.  Our timed entrance began at 10:30 and we could get on any time until 7:30pm.  We got there at 11:30, and waited in line maybe 10-15 min, not bad.  It moved fast.  Time on was 27 minutes.  Great views, capsules are air conditioned.  Experience is exactly what you’d expect.  ",The London Eye is cool. 
"July 20, 2018","Lines, shuffles to get the spot you want in the car, and the random 20 people you can be stuck with all prejudice this attraction. However the one thing that stands clear is the need to visit it and ride the Eye. It has great views, and you a look at history from the air!",Nice but too expensive 
"July 16, 2018","The view is awesome but the price you pay isn’t worth. We paid for the fast track ticket in advance and the normal line was fast, so for us it was a lost of money ",Easy access and effecient
"July 15, 2018","Bought tickets online in the US before arriving in London.  Very easy website to navigate. On arrival, just showed our tickets right at the gate and we were on board in less than 5 minutes",Great view
"July 15, 2018","We went up on the London Eye. It would have been nicer if they wouldn’t have put so many people in each pod. The “photo glass panels” are only on one side of the pod so the photos you take from the other side through the “normal glass” aren’t as clear.It is nice to see the city from so far above it.Tip: buy your tickets ahead of time online and make sure you specify you want the “fast lane” ones so that when you get there you can be ushered through a quicker, shorter line and not have to wait through the normal (very long line.)",Best time
"August 4, 2018",The Coca Cola is a really nice place to go and overlook the wonderful London city it goes slowly so you can make the most of it you have to go to this amazing landmark ,Good but queue in the sun was tough
"August 4, 2018",Excellent views of London but the long queue with no shade was challenging and boring for 6yr old - 40 mins. ,100% go says the 9 year old
"August 3, 2018",Yes it is really crowded but it’s worth the wait The place u get ur tickets is not at the London eye it’s in a different building You can get packages that have other things like the wax museum or the Tower of London and save money that way.,Eye would recommend
"August 1, 2018","We pre-booked tickets for the London eye and would definitely recommend doing this as this is a popular attraction among many tourists as it is so eye-conic so lines are busy, our tickets allowed us immediately entry. Wasn’t waiting long in lines and when we stepped into this magnificent treat to the eye, we were amazed, attraction offers a seating area and also provides instructions on where to stand for photos, ride offers clear views across the capital, able to see majority of London’s landmarks, however if you have a phobia of heights would not recommend as it may be frightening, eye thought it was amazing, attraction goes at a slow speed enabling you to take in all the glory, attraction lasted roughly 45 minutes. Therefore eye would definitely recommend and eye will be visiting again very soon.",Chocolate Tasting Experience
"July 30, 2018","We paid a little extra for the Hotel Chocolat Chocolate tasting experience, with this you get a Hotel Chocolat Rep telling you all about the different chocolates as she hands each one out, you also get two glasses of prosecco one for each rotation on the London Eye!!!  There was non alcoholic options also available for children and non drinkers!!I have been on the Eye twice before this experience and i would have to say this was by far the best way to do it.  We were collected from the VIP Coca Cola lounge and fast tracked onto the eye.  We shared the experience with 20 people in total and the whole thing lasted an hour.  I would like to say i could have stayed longer but even i was starting to feel a little sick of all the chocolate by the last bite!!!! (there was plenty of chocolate!!)  another nice touch is that you each get a nice sized box of chocolates to take home too.All in all fantastic experience the staff handing out chocolate and drinks were lovely and they gave you plenty of opportunity to look around at the views in between eating and drinking.",Recommended 
"July 29, 2018","Amazing experience, although you can see that view from other attractions, is expensive for what you really ver from it ",We didn’t even make it to the wheel - the booking/time slot system is a joke
"July 29, 2018","We booked standard tickets in advance for a spesific time slot. However we were sent in the back of the enormous queue together with all other ticketholders. The queue didn’t even have a proper path, just a bunch of people making their own line. After some time we reached our allocated slot, and we asked a member of staff how long more waitingtime was expected before we reached the wheel. The answer was 1 hour. We didn’t have time for that so we left and thought we’d just change the time slot on their booking page to another day/time. And that’s where we got surprised, when we first entered our initial slot, it said it could be changed a number of times for free, but not now.... our booking was not there anymore because the time slot has passed. Altogether we must say that the time slot and booking system is a joke. The ride might be good but they have to do something with the process before you enter the wheel. ",Long que’s avoid if time is an issue
"July 28, 2018",My husband and I booked online for a 4pm ride in the London eye. We arrived at 3.45 and was over an hour later by the time we stood in the que. Great view’s although I wouldn’t say it is half an hour more like 15 mins. ,fun view of the city
"July 25, 2018","took the fast track ticket or would have to wait for over an hour, great views of the city by the Thames river on this 30 minute journey",Not really worth the ticket price
"July 25, 2018","Although the Eye offers food views, it really isnt worth the ticket price unless you buy a package.The air con is good in each pod and it is well organised to visit. ",great
"September 3, 2021","great view of London and very covid aware, cars cleaned after every use, on and off in no time, nice area its in as well",Great experience
"September 2, 2021",Great experience was amazing the view was fantastic. I don’t like heights but that was wonderful Would recommend to anyone,Great tour!
"September 2, 2021","Lovely river cruise, Jack our tour guide was great! Very informative and interesting:) Would definitely recommended!!",Fun experience for all
"September 2, 2021","It was top of the to do list on our family trip to London, as it was a Bank Holiday we booked the fast track in which it took us less than 5 minutes from joining the queue to boarding the eye. The general queue was long but seemed to still move at a reasonable pace the fastback made it easier with children.  They eye itself was pleasant, not too crowded inside & some lovely views to be taken in, although it helps to know what your looking at besides obvious buildings, a gentleman was kind enough to point out various buildings so I felt that made our experience better, perhaps they could hand you a map when you arrive so you can have a better idea? Overall a fun experience for all the family & they accommodate pushchairs and wheelchair users too so nobody need miss out 😊",A must attraction
"September 1, 2021",Well organised really nice staff great attraction Then did the boat trip Jack the guide was brilliant,Back on it again
"September 1, 2021",It was our children’s first experience on the Eye and after the initial excitement they settled down to watch the wheel go round and reach back down to disembark. Prior booking for time slot and mobile scanners made everything very easy without having to stand in long queues. We were in the queue for 10 mins and then were into a pod. Pods were filled up as normal and it was up to the people to wear masks. The pods were being quickly sanitised before the next group of people jumped on.,Such a great cruise!
"September 1, 2021","We did the boat cruise as an add on to our London Eye and Sea Life combo ticket - so thrilled that we did!Lovely boat road, and the guide, AJ, was superb.Definitely a highlight and highly recommended.",Good with friends
"August 31, 2021",If you are from London its a good way to see the whole city as on a good day you can see from Stratford to Heathrow. I definetly feel the more people you know you have in a capsule the better as its a more enjoyable experience. The only down side is the price of the tickets. ,Excellent tour guide - Liam!
"August 31, 2021",We thoroughly enjoyed our river cruise with our 9 & 6 year old! Liam was fantastic and we really enjoyed his humour. I will be recommending this tour to my friends and family!,Great views
"August 31, 2021",A must do when you visit London.  Great views of the city.    Queue moved pretty quickly despite it being so busy.,Skip the Line Tickets a Must
"April 6, 2018","We highly recommend the skip the line tickets for the London Eye. We has purchased our tickets day before and was well worth it. The standard line was lengthy, but with the skip the line tickets, we pretty much walked straight onto the London Eye. Great views and experience for all. ",Not so cool... Maybe just with a nice weather 
"April 6, 2018","Ok, is a good attraction very known in UK but isn't so cool, maybe if you have luck for a good weather and you like calm things to do and it's ok to wait for a long line this can be a good thing to do... Otherwise, can be really boring. So, depends what do u like.I don't know if I would have patience for another time in this attraction... ",Pretty cool
"April 5, 2018",Premium merlin passes so pretty much walked straight on using the fast track lane. No booking required. Wasn’t expecting that! The attraction lasts about half hour. Great views of the city.,Fabulous
"April 2, 2018",I was taken to the London Eye for a champagne ride and initially thought I wouldn’t like it. I thought it would be slow and boring but I was so wrong. Yes of course it was slow but it was great with fabulous views over London. We got into our pod and were presented with a glass of Champagne. The pod had a bench seat in the middle so if you wanted to sit you could but we mainly stood up and admired the view. Thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely do again.,Great attraction
"April 1, 2018","This is a must see , to see London. Get there early or book in advance. Especially if you have a bigger family or group. The fast track is a good idea. Stunning view of a great destination.",Good experience
"March 29, 2018","Myself and my boyfriend visited the London eye this month during a weekend away in the city. It was a first experience from my boyfriend and a second for myself. Would definitely recommend if you are visiting London, and have not been on before. The views are pretty cool and it is a really good experience. Definitely something you need to do if your visiting London. However it is not something you really do more than once.",Worth the visit!
"March 27, 2018","Great views, pods are large and fit 15 or so people. Plenty of time on the ride, moves very slowly, tons of photo opportunities!  Bought tickets when we arrived, got a queue time (about 20 minutes after time we bought tickets) and boarded without much waiting. ",Decided to give it a miss this year
"April 19, 2018","We bring grandchildren to London every year and this has been a fixture of our visits, but we decided to give it a miss this year - in our opinion grossly over-priced, plus the inconvenience of long lines. Not to say that thye view from the top is not impressive.",Best View over London
"April 18, 2018",I absolutely love this place...I think I came here over 10 times already lol. Highly recommended for tourists + locals :-),Brilliant
"April 16, 2018",Loved this river cruise.the boat was comfortable with an upstairs deck. Brilliant commentary. We saw a lot of landmarks. Our 10 year old granddaughter loved it.we worth a trip. I would deff do it again next time we visit London.,Scared of heights but loved it!
"April 15, 2018","As I am a merlin annual pass holder, I don’t have to pay to go on but if I didn’t have a merlin pass I don’t think I would pay the prices they charge as they are quite expensive for a half hour ride. However, the staff are friendly and happy to help. Because the London Eye moves while you are getting on, the staff stop the ride if you are in a wheelchair, disabled or have a buggy/pushchair and help you get on safely. If you want a picture done then I would recommend you get it done before the ride because there is one near the end of the ride and strangers often get in the picture near the end. I find it a bit cheeky that you have to walk through the gift shop to get out but it’s not that bad. Great view day or night.",Great booking
"April 15, 2018",Weather wasn’t great so we didn’t expect to queue as long as reviews we had read. We had pre booked Tesco clubcard tickets. We printed at home. Went straight to the queue and we were on the eye within 10 mins. Even though weather wasn’t great a fun time was had. ,Big wheel
"April 12, 2018",I must admit I was apprehensive about this ride as I have a fear of heights! It was a nice smooth ride .. I even managed to stand and look down (bonus) it was shame about the view as the day was cloudy ..would do again on a sunnier day.,Less Crowded than last time.
"April 11, 2018","My eldest daughter requested a trip on the eye when we visited London and we agreed. We utilised the days out in London 2 for 1 offer with the rail tickets. Otherwise it is very expensive to do.It was as I remember. They could improve the interactive experience within the pod, or reduce the price. I also downloaded the app before we went but it was rubbish, don’t bother.The views were ok, both children enjoyed it and for the first time we did not have to queue for very long to get on.  It will remain a must do for tourists but is not my favourite ",A great view!
"April 10, 2018","My daughter’s dream came true! We’ve visited the London Eye! The view and emotions were great, though the view of Paris from the Eiffel Tower we liked more. Londoners - no hard feelings!😄",Good fun
"April 9, 2018","This is a very fun attraction, it allows you to get a great view of London which is great for snapping photos. This also appeared to be fun for all the young children on board judging by the way they were acting. ",Worth it!
"April 7, 2018",Worth every penny! Spend extra 10 quid and get a fast track tickets! Totally worth it! The view is absolutely amazing!,Very long wait
"March 26, 2018",The line was very long and it was a cold day so we didn't have munch fun. It's okay to do it once but I will not do it again.,Night Raid
"March 26, 2018","Near the top of our list of things to do when coming to London from America was to ride The London Eye, which we did on Sunday, March 25.  We purchased Day & Night Tickets, thinking, ""WOW!! A chance to see the lights of London after dark.""  Well, imagine our disappointment when the ticket required our ""Night"" ride to be on the same day after 4:30 pm, but the ride closed at 6 pm when it was still daylight!!!  We saw no point in making another ascent in daylight and tried to find customer service at the site.  Guess what -- no such thing!!  I was told by one employee at the ticket office to go on-line for customer service.  There is no such option that I can find on the web site nor is there a phone number.  So, I guess we wind up eating the extra pounds we spent for the Day & Night ticket.  Word to the wise:  make sure it's dark for you night ride!!!!!  AND, don't hope to be able to get any ""customer service"".",Birds Eye View!
"March 25, 2018",This was included in our itinerary on a coach tour to London. A lovely experience on a nice cold day. Plenty of people queueing but we didn't have to wait long.  Breathtaking views.  Plenty of photography.,Good to see
"May 4, 2018","London from this attraction is necessary to see. I recommend to buy online on CocaCola London Eye and buy fast-track and save ticket to phone. If you have bad weather, buy additionaly flexi time, you can come whenever you want and without any line!",Amazing views
"May 2, 2018",No matter if you are an adult or a child the London Eye it’s an amazing experience which gives you one of the best aerial views of London. If you want a romantic experience you can go at night and order champagne while riding the wheel. ,"Amazing View, you have to try this"
"May 1, 2018","I am afraid of heights but could not miss this opportunity to see across London and all the iconic buildings, you have to try this, loved every minute. ",Very nice ride
"April 30, 2018","Nice spacious capsules with enough view points to see the scenery from all angles We were there on a very very hot day, so it was lovely that the capsules were all air conditioned. The staff were very nice too All in all a good experience It takes about 35/40 mins for the wheel to go all the way round",Good
"April 29, 2018","This was good to see all the sites of London from. If we did not have fast pass however, I am unsure if we would have waited in the gigantic line. ",Ok experience but not worth the money
"April 29, 2018",It’s an expensive experience and long waiting times during summer time to get up. But the British weather doesn’t do justice to the views. Its not something I would recommend to people when they.come to visit us. Rather go up the shard.,What a fun familiy experience
"April 29, 2018",Great skyline and nice to see the views from a different perspective. Easy to get too safe for kids too.,Goes up. Comes down. 
"April 29, 2018","Didn’t have to wait too long to get on or to get tickets. We went on a Sunday. It was busy. Don’t think it’s worth getting a fast track ticket. The capsule is good. Moves slowly. Good views of the city from different angles, which was cool. Not all the touch screens worked in the capsule, which is why I’ve marked it down - otherwise, it did what it should. Wouldn’t say it’s a must do. We were here 4 years ago and didn’t go on. For some reason I feel like a Coke. ",Beautiful view but not as good as i360
"April 29, 2018","Having gone to the British Airways i360, I had high expectations for the London Eye but felt that the 'pods' obscured the view quite a bit and the weather caused the 'pod' to cloud up a bit making it a bit disappointing. Skip the greenscreen photos and opt for a few selfies while you are up there and remember to enjoy the view",Poor queuing system ruined it. 
"April 29, 2018",I'd already booked tickets but was told i needed to go inside to recieve official tickets so we queued for 30 minutes to collect our tickets. We then went outside and joined another long queue for another 45 minutes.  At times we didn't move at all as the fast track had a constant stream of people. Then this woman kicked up a stink behind us and the staff allowed her through - what a joke.!! Finally 1.5hrs after arriving at the London Eye we got on it but in honestly the moment had passed and i don't think the experience was totally appreciated.  Not exactly a cheap experience. ,London’s Main Attraction.. Oddly
"January 26, 2018","Me and my mother were recommended to book tickets before actually arriving in London as it can get quite full on the day so to avoid disappointment! you However, we booked this specific day as it was the only day available out of the days we were visiting which obviosuly suggested it was going to be busy but it was also the only day out of our visit that the heavens opened and absolutely chucked it down ALL DAY!We got soaked queuing because the queue was so long that half of it wasn’t under the shelter and that kind of ruined it as we were cold and wet in the capsule. We couldn’t see that far into the distance because it was all dark and cloudy!Although the weather is uncontrollable, it would be good to have open tickets and a bigger sheltered area! We would’ve chosen not to go but it was £48 for 2 of us which is a lot just to throw away! This price is ridiculous for what it is! Not at all worth it so I wouldn’t waste your money unless you get one of the packages with multiple attraction tickets but we’d already done the dungeons and madame tussaud’s on a previous trip! ",London Eye
"January 25, 2018",This is so amazing I suggest every one see this at last once and spend the day here grab lunch sit outside in the spring and summer,Pram madness
"January 23, 2018","I came with my family and not until we were about to get on we were told to remove our two young children from their Prams and carry the prams and children on to the capsule, this is ridiculous and ruined our experience. Why were we not told before and what is the difference in having out Pram up or or it taking up half the floor space folded down inside the capsule. This is not being managed properly and it requires sorting. Behind us was a lady with twins in a double buggy and she was told she was have to wait u til a wheelchair user came off before she could go on. Outstanding! ",Spectacular views of London
"January 22, 2018","Views from London Eye are very nice.  I find it more worth than the View at the Shard.  Long wait though even in winter, so be prepared to wait in queue for some time.",S.m garrett
"January 22, 2018",Lots of quing but worth it in the end go later in the day when it's quieter cos tourists go seem to have gone a bit by then ,Terrifying
"January 19, 2018","No toilets in the pods, nearly cacked myself, tourists laughing and screaming, terrible Brexit now or we're  dead",Excellent view 
"January 14, 2018","My recommendation is to make a fast track ticket, you can avoid long queue on the ticket office. Is a little bit expensive than the ordinary ticket but is better if you don’t have a lot of  time to stay in London. You must see this attraction. Really recommended!  ",Nope
"January 11, 2018",Very expensive and the queue is massive! It’s only for one time ! Never again ! Oh my lord never again.,Champagne experience 
"January 8, 2018",Outstanding experience and recommend this place too anyone.. My partner and I decided too do something different for her birthday and we weren't disappointed.. Our Pod host Gianni was excellent and made the whole event very special.,Goof views
"January 7, 2018",Got tickets on the day. The que for the bag check could have done with someone explaining what was going to happen to speed up the process. There was a small amount of que jumping. However the eye gives scenic views. The best time to go is late afternoon. The crowds have died down and you can get both light day pictures and early sunset photos. The price has increased dramatically since my last visit. I would be wary to return unless visiting with someone new to London.,Overrated
"March 7, 2018","I would say that the London Eye is a must, but no more than once. The view is definitely great, but overall it's overpriced, overcrowded and overrated. I would strongly advise ordering your tickets beforehand, unless you want to spend an hour waiting outside.",to the top of london
"March 5, 2018",The best way to see London from above. The pods are very spacious although if you don't like being closed in this may not be good for you. It moves slowly so you have a lot of time to see the amazing views over London. Make sure that you pick a clear day. Be ready to wait for your turn as this could be up to 15minutes or longer. Not suitable for people who are not good on their feet.,"""Big wheel keeps on turning"""
"March 5, 2018","Admittedly we did do this in style, amidst the hundreds queuing we went straight up to the VIP lounge, having booked it some time ago. A nice glass up bubbly in the splender of the lounge, then collected and escorted to the pod complete with its own mini bar and another couple of glasses to boot. Views of London f of a unique position on a cold but fine sunny day and only a five minute walk from Gilray's Steak Bar and all that County Hall has to offer, great night out and spectacular when the wheel is lit up after dark","Nothing special, disorganization, rude staff"
"March 4, 2018",I supposed it was a special attraction but it wasn't. We also did almost 2 hours queue to buy tickets. Staff very rude and completely disorganized as they should be cause the place attracts a lot of people every single day.,pretty every time
"March 4, 2018",I've been to the London Eye 3 times and I enjoyed it equally each time. It never gets boring! The only downside is the long queuing but I guess that's part of the experience too  ,Amazing
"March 3, 2018","This trip was amazing and benefited from London on a cold crisp morning. The views were fantastic, the organisation to get you on and off was fine and plenty of space in your capsule as you completed the journey.Great views of Westminster/Whitehall and as far as Buckingham Palace. The whole trip was one of great enjoyment.",360 degree view of London
"March 1, 2018",London eye gives the option to get 360 degree view of city. It’s looks beautiful from the top and you can have a bird eye view of all important places of London. There is an entry fee for this attraction and you have the option to book the same in advance through online. We visited London eye during snow and view was breathtaking. ,Champagne Experience 
"February 27, 2018","My friends and I did the champagne experience to spice up the trip a bit. It wasn’t over the top as expected. Our tour guide was friendly, Asian guy. But didn’t talk at all during the tour. I was expecting him to talk about the buildings and be knowledgeable ... wasn’t sure if he was tired or what. Also- we asked for some OJ that was on his cart with our champagne and he gave us a hard time about it. Overall anyone should do the London Eye because it is beautiful and you see the whole city. I would recommend doing it at sunset . It was breathe taking views. ",Amazing view!!!
"February 26, 2018","I went to London eye with a combo with London Dugeon, Sea Life Aquarium and Madame Touseeau, which is cheaper than by one by one and it was amazing, ",Fantastic Views
"February 23, 2018",A comfortable and educational way to get an overview of London.  Don't forget your camera! Friendly and helpful guides.,A must do on your first trip to London
"December 31, 2017","The best way to get the lay of the land.  You can skip the 4D movie, it doesn't add much to the experience.",Okay-ish experience
"December 29, 2017",The ride was too slow and long for the kids. The view was indeed spectacular with the river flowing below and you could see almost all of london. However with kids (5&7) they got bored within 15 minutes of the ride. The box was warm and about 20 ppl were accommodated for one round in one box.,Best views ever!!
"December 29, 2017",I went there with my ten-year-old son. He loved it and said it was one of the highlights of our trip. The views were very beautiful and great for selfies and panoramas. The staff were helpful and kind. We felt very safe. We got fast passes so we got to skip the queue. Great time!,Ahhh.... Champagne!!!
"December 28, 2017","Unless you're doing the VIP champagne experience this is just another tourist trap.  You wait a long time in a queue to go around twice on this architecturally impressive Monument, and then you're ushered to the area where they trying to sell you the old photo on the mug nonsense.However, the Night-Time champagne experience was worth it because you skip the queue, and once near the top you get a glass of Champagne and are there with a much smaller group, if any, and you get to enjoy a beautiful sunset view of London.",Gorgeous 
"December 27, 2017",I went with a 4 year old and 7 year old. Excellent experience for everyone. Hands down do not miss this. ,"Pay for Fast Pass...it's worth the visit, but not the lines"
"December 27, 2017",The views of London are spectacular - but it's not tix you want to buy ahead as the visibility can be poor. We bought fast pass which cut our wait time down to less than 10 minutes on a busy holiday.  ,Worth the visit
"December 18, 2017",Amazing experience. The views were fantastic. Well organized entry. Only queued for 10mins. Easy to reach from Waterloo Underground. The 4D experience was amazing,Lovely 
"December 16, 2017",I am a Londoner so typically I never do the 'touristy' things as you always take them for granted being that they are always on your doorstep. However for my birthday my boyfriend surprised me with a champagne VIP package and it was lovely. The sun was setting so the view looked lovely and the champagne was lovely. Nothing else much to say but if you are visiting it's worth doing  to take some nice pictures and have the experience  ,Are you kidding me?
"December 13, 2017","Going to London during the winter is a risky thing due to the weather.  First couple of days the weather was cold and overcast but no rain so it was great.  Big bonus to going at this time of year is that the lines are much, much shorter.  The last two days the weather was bad.  Rain mixed with sleet and snow.  We went to the Eye on a Sunday and it was closed due to bad weather.  You would figure that being in London they would know how to deal with this.  We went back the next day, same kind of weather, and it was open.  Why closed one day but open the next?  We stood in line for an hour and a half, and this was a slow day!  Most of the time that we were in line we were not under cover, but outside dealing with the bad weather.  We had coats, scarves, gloves and umbrellas but still got very wet and very, very cold.  The cost of a ticket per adult is about $23.  They fit at least 12 adults into each car and there are I believe about 20 cars on the Eye.  That works out to be just over $5500 per full revolution.  I don't know how many times this thing does a full revolution, but I think 10 would be a safe number.  $55,000 a day, conservatively is what they make.  So, ARE YOU KIDDING ME!, that they cannot afford to put up a proper canopy with some heat lamps during the winter months.  There were people in wheel chairs, parents with kids in strollers, all having to stand out in that bad weather for hours.  I don't care how prepared you are, when it's that cold and wet, and you are outside for that long, you are miserable.All the money these guys are making, they should be making more of an effort to make their guests comfortable.  The ride and the view from the Eye are spectacular, that's the only reason why I gave this three stars instead of one.",Great experience
"December 4, 2017",It was great experience and didn’t have to queue for very long! Nice to go once and see all of London ,great attraction & to see a lot of London form up high.
"February 11, 2018","Usually long queues to buy a ticket, but well worth the wait. Very efficiently run & the crowds move quickly. ",Amazing experience - birdseye view of London
"February 10, 2018","If you've got little time in London, do the London eye - it's a great view over London, with a flight-like experience, which is quite thrilling really.I had been many years ago but London's skyline has changed so much - I loved it, again.Downside: in peak season the queues are annoying - try to book early in the day and make sure you arrive with plenty of time to pick up tickets (if collecting). We queued for an hour.",Slow but Cool
"February 9, 2018","It takes about 35 minutes to get around on a good night- sites are beautiful though, I personally don't like heights, but you do get used to it as you go around.I recommend doing it in the night time because the lights are stunning - worth doing and nice to take a break after a busy day :)",Unique view
"February 9, 2018",All London in your feet... you make really good selfies there..  but it's only for 20-30 minutes approximately.. ,Great views! 
"February 6, 2018","This is a must for Londoners. Go in the evening when it is not so busy! It’s fun to spot the different land marks from up high, and the information boards are great too. ",Good sky view and landmark 
"February 4, 2018","It’s worth to try one time. At least, you can see the view of London city and those landmark buildings. ",A London Eyecon
"February 3, 2018","A must, when in London, be sure to get the Fast Pass.  Staff are courteous, the area is clean,  and there is a gift shop. Fun for the whole family! Don’t go though if you are afraid of heights!  ",Beautiful London Views of Major Landmarks
"February 3, 2018","Our family of four walked from the Westminster Abbey across the bridge to the London Eye. I highly recommend walking around and seeing the views. Once we arrived at the London Eye, we purchased our tickets about an hour before sunset and made our place line. Sunset is usually a popular time so please get their early. There are a few places to eat around the mall area. It is definitely a ""must-do"" while in the city.",Great view 
"January 30, 2018",Great view u can see many of the sights such as Buckingham palace and Wembley stadium and many other sights I would definitely recommend if like to see the sights . ,"Terrific view of the Thames, Big Ben, The Tower of London, and so on."
"January 28, 2018","If travelling from Canada, get your tickets from Trip Advisor and take them the day of your visit.  Easy, no line up to buy tickets, well worth it.  The wheel moves so slowly, even the most squeamish can take a ride on the London Eye. At first my 79 year old mom was worried, but then she was quickly at the window looking out!",Worth a visit with the kids
"December 1, 2017","I presume it must be London’s answer to the Eifel Tower, although I don’t think it is as high as the Parisian icon. I would recommend this visit for parents with kids over 5, but watch out for the hefty price you would have to pay for the tickets. Beautiful views of London from a vantage point though!",Best 45 minutes spent in south bank
"November 28, 2017",Best 45 minutes spent in south bankwe took a tourfor viewing London from aboveenjoyed all of uswe had many pictures,A Tourist Trap
"November 26, 2017","It´s too boring, too crowded, and to expesive, for a 20/25min ride.Instead of spending your money here got to the Sky Garden, better views of London, and it´s FREE!!!",What a view!
"November 20, 2017","The London Eye was erected since my last visit to town, so I gave it a chance. It was a beautiful sunny clear day, and you could see for miles in every direction. You're in a car that holds 25 people or so, and the ride is one circuit which lasts about 25 minutes. Great angles for photos.",A good visit
"November 18, 2017",Had an enjoyable time taking photos along the way! Lots of photo opportunities with surrounding shops and attractions,Interesting but overpriced
"November 15, 2017",London Eye. Well it was alright but I would say overpriced and underwhelming. I would suggest some audio feed would make it more interesting but to each his own as I am  sure others would prefer the silence. I am not sure I would do again unless it was at daytime and I was with someone who really wanted to go on it. For a seasoned traveler to London I might think it would be underwhelming and would serve only to check off your bucket list. That said it depends on the age of rider(s) and might be cool for youngsters and those wishing to pick off seeing London landmarks from great heights.Side note- my picture once appeared in one of the booths/ capsules back in 2015 out of pure chance! So was cool to see that and to then actually go on the loop/tour years after the fact.,Just a Tourist  Stop
"November 7, 2017","Vacillated about doing this because it felt so touristy but finally broke down and went, It was ...okay. The view is spectacular but easily done at other places. It was efficiently organized and there was no wait involved at all.Do it cause you are supposed to but don't get too excited",Great day out 
"November 6, 2017",Best views in London depending on the weather! We got lucky and had a cloudless day fantastic! Combined with a trip to London aquarium afterwards.... south bank is a great place to take in the sights!,Cheated by London Eye website.
"November 3, 2017","My mother sister and I decided to book online to get the tickets for the London Eye, but were in for a nasty shock.When I went to pick up our 3 tickets, I was given 9 tickets, to my horror. I told the ticket booth girl I needed assistance, as I only bought 3 tickets, so she brought the manager over, who stated that I could try to get a refund if I sent an email to customer service.I did, and received several unhelpful emails before I finally got a reply today, November 3rd, 2 days later, only to be told they cannot help me.Meaning, I have lost 156 Great Britain Pounds of no fault of mine, even though the customer service person emailing me apologized for ""my error of buying 6 extra tickets."" I am a tourist visiting London with my mother and sister, making us a party of 3, so why would I buy 6 extra tickets?  And are you really going to blame me instead of helping me? Are you really going to keep my money, 156 sterling, without shame?   ",Spectacular views! 
"October 30, 2017",Would definitely recommend a trip on the London Eye. Take your camera and go on a clear day - you can see for miles. Gently climbs to its full height. The pods are roomy with seating available. ,Fantastic view and service
"October 5, 2017",We got the Champagne deal which I highly recommend... you get to sit in the lounge with a complimentary glass of champers as you wait to be collected by your host/ hosts.. Our hosts were Jake and Jeanie and they were exceptional in their roles...We then got fast tracked to our pod where we got another glass of champagne... overall a great view and experience and well done Jake and Jeanie,Amazing view! 
"October 4, 2017","London without London eye isn’t London, magic view from the London eye, I had a really nice sunset and an amazing experience. ",Sold out London
"October 4, 2017",This was my fourth time on the London Eye. Was horrified to discover it's now sponsored by Coke and along with it it's become more like a Disney attraction. The views are still as awesome as they were 15 years ago but all of the advertising on the lower windows of the pod means photos are impeded if you're trying to get a shot downwards. What a disappointment. If you're going to sell your soul to a brand at least make it an English one. ,The London Eye
"October 4, 2017","This gigantic Ferris Wheel is the best way to get a ""Birds-Eye"" view of London. It even takes a picture of you if you stand on the red foot marks on the floor. You can purchase the picture once you get back on the ground and visit the gift shop.",Great views!
"October 2, 2017",Definitely would recommend getting front of the line tickets.  Fantastic views and great pics as well.,It’s a must
"October 2, 2017","Yes, definitely you have to do this. Especially wait for the nice weather and open view. You may have to get in line and spend sometime for the cue but I think it’s worth waiting",Beautiful
"October 2, 2017","Just an amazing place! Beautiful view, place and people!! Everybody should go, families, couples even single people!!",What a view
"October 1, 2017",I visited with a group of Guides. Great views of London along the Thames. The Qs are a bit long but it is constantly moving so it doesn’t feel that you are waiting a long time. Definitely book a fast pass so you can jump the Qs,Looking tired 
"October 1, 2017",This was on my 8 year olds wish list so we used our Merlin passes to get on. We went at 2pm on a Saturday and joined the 50 min queue which did move quickly. I went on the eye when it first opened but feels like more people are squeezed in the each capsule and the only one Samsung info pad was working so we missed so much to look out for. It's one of those activities to be able to say you have done but do it on an offer and don't pay full price! ,What a View!
"September 29, 2017","I decided to ride ""The London Eye"" after some hesitation. The line seemed awfully long but I gave it a shot. I was surprised at how quickly the line moved. In 15-20 minutes I was walking aboard. I found it interesting that the London Eye never stops rotating. It rotates slowly enough to let folks embark and disembark with time to spare. One is aboard for one rotation and I forget how long that takes, maybe 30-45 minutes. The view was fantastic and I'm very happy I took the time to ride ""The London Eye.""",The london view
"September 25, 2017","This is a must see for people visiting london.located on the river thames,london eye gives a beautiful view of the city..dont spend time taking selfies or photos because you will miss the amazing view.also get the fast lane.its much quicker.the whole family loved it.","great views, shame about organisation"
"September 25, 2017","Decided to do the eye as we were in London for the weekend and weather was fab. Booked standard tickets online, arrived 20 mins before scheduled ticket time and then had to que for 40 mins to get on board. No issue with this, but felt it needed pointing out when booking. Yes could have paid an extra £10 per ticket for fast track when there, or online, but that is no more than que jumping in my opinion. The time on your ticket was irrelevant, the staff only checking they were valid. The ride itself was pleasant, air conditioned and great views",Great views 
"September 22, 2017",Great views from the minute you get on to time you get off.TIP.use the fast track to avoid a long wait. Security is tight getting on but worth it in this case.Def recommend it to friends and family ,Even better than our high expectations -- with the bonus of a Christmas card photo -- but buy tickets in advance
"September 22, 2017","My husband and I, and especially our nephew, were greatly looking forward to our ride on The Eye, and we enjoyed it even more than we expected. The pre-ride 4D film was very good (but too short).  The 30-minute ride itself was terrific.  It goes very slowly, so you hardly feel it is moving while you view spectacular panoramic scenes from well above the face of Big Ben.  The pod is very big and there are so few passengers (15-18) in each one so you have plenty of space to sit down or wander around to look at all the sights as the ride progresses.An earlier TA reviewer was critical of the photo process.  We found it very well organized, with plenty of time at each of the three photo areas to organize your group to ""look pretty.""  At the first stop one of the attendants even held my glasses for me (I'm too vain to wear glasses in pictures!).  The photos are expensive, as is always true in tourist spots like this.  The first print is 25 pounds but it comes with a souvenir book to hold your photos.  Then the second and additional ones are only 5 pounds each.  We happily purchased two, and one will be on our Christmas card this year.  On your receipt they provide a website address where you can access any photo(s) you purchased for your personal digital album and to share with others.Of course you can always take your own photos, not only of the scenery but also selfies (no sticks, please!).  But the official ones show you superimposed in the pod with Big Ben in the background, something that would be hard to achieve on your own.Important tip:  Be sure to buy your tickets online in advance -- and we highly recommend spending extra for the Fast Track to avoid long lines.  We chose the Flexi Fast Track for 40 pounds each so we could go any time on the day we chose. Book on The Eye's website (not Expedia, where people complained of hassles with their tickets).After your ride, you can enjoy a delightful walk along both sides of the Thames viewing all sorts of famous sights like Big Ben, the Parliament Buildings, 10 Downing and New Scotland Yard.  You also can take one of the guided cruises on the Thames; you buy tickets and catch the boat right near the base of The Eye.",Touristy But Fun
"September 21, 2017","Although it is touristy, it provides excellent views of the city and photo ops.  No lines at all the day we went so it was very pleasant",Great if you get absolutely nothing else to so 
"September 20, 2017","I found the London Eye a little overrated given how long the queue is (even if you pre-buy your ticket) and how slow it goes around. The views were nice, but the glass wasn't very clean as there's sticky finger marks and lots of glare; so getting good videos and photos was challenging. There is a seat in the middle if you fancy sitting down which was nice, but if I recall, there was about 6 seats but 15 people per pod - basically, if you want a seat , FIGHT FOR IT! There's no denying the views are beautiful, especially if you're luckily enough to catch the sun setting over parliament. If you're from tourist, it's great! If you're from the capital and thinking of this for a date, hummm... you can do better! E.g  head over to London Cocktail Club (my fave spot) and then walk down the river when the city is lit up.",Must see attraction 
"September 18, 2017","One of the most non forgotten experience. Best to ride in a sunny clear weather,Kids enjoyed it as much as we did. The view from the highest point is fascinating. Our trip was in September so no long queues in all attractions. Best to reserve your ticket online prior to visit.",Nice experience. Highly recommended
"September 17, 2017","We booked the last hour of the cruise (4:45pm) on 16th September. The speaker Vicky told us the story behind all the spots during the trip (Houses of Parliament, Tower Bridge, etc). Then we went to London Eye (without crowds). I strongly recommend the experience. Perfect for couples and families.",Beautiful birds eye view of London
"September 17, 2017",Not for the faint heart. People with a fear of heights should avoid looking down once at the too or go to the edge of the carriage. The view at the top is breathtakingly beautiful. ,There is no better way of seeing London...
"September 14, 2017",I have been on the London Eye 5 times now and still love it more every time. Even when i drive past it or see it on TV i get a funny feeling inside! Its just perfect. I can't imagine London without the EYE!!!,Excellent way to view London
"August 21, 2017","Highly recommend to book online ahead to avoid long wait in line. Otherwise, long line to wait. Package due with other 3 attractions are great value if you need something to kill time. You will enjoy the best view of London.",Best view
"August 17, 2017","The london eye was a great experience. Although the line looked long, it moved really quickly and smoothly. The view was amazing and we got lots of great photos of london.",Coca-Cola London Eye - GET wifi people this is 2017!
"August 16, 2017","Right the thing itself is really good... you'll enjoy it.  imagine a massive ferris wheel in the middle of London, its like that. HOWEVER, when you go online and buy your tickets it recommends ( several times )  you get the e-ticket to show the entrance staff your mobile phone when you get to the attraction as it will save you time - they lied... this is our story...My family joined the London eye queue outside, the guy said 'great' as I showed him my e-ticket, we joined the snaking line that to be fair only took about 30/40 mins to get to the front... not to bad I hear you say... Then when you're underneath the 'EYE' enclosed by glass and steel..that's when the fun starts - The attendant asks to see my tickets and as I go to show her my phone my heart sinks 'no service' its like being back in 1998, I hear Will Smith singing ""Getting Jiggy with it"" and catch a glimpse of a guy reading a newspaper the headline is Bill Clinton Denies having sexual relations in the Oval office...I'm horrified my son looks up at me a tear forms in the corner of his eye 'What-ever shall we do daddy' ? I hear him say  annnnyway... I suddenly remember I'm a genius to took a screen grab of the bar-code !! whoo- hoo my reputation as Super-Dad is going to be restored ( I don't have a reputation as Super-Dad its 2017 remember,  the kids have you-tube and in Russia someones Dad juggles chainsaws and in America there is that fella that dresses up as Batman 24/7.. I am to damn lazy for any of that nonsense. I show the attendant the photo she scans it all is good for about 3 seconds.... but NO,  OMG what could it be? - where are the other bar-codes !! what other bar-codes I say, I have to see the other bar-codes the attendant repeats Mmmhahaahah ( think Elliot Carver the 007 villain in Tomorrow never-dies the one with Pierce Brosnan, you know..   )  ... SOOoooo I'm there waving my arms in the air like a bored gorilla in an all too small glass enclosure trying desperately to get a phone signal...   My kids are now stood about like the cast of Big Brother on eviction night ( stay-with me its 1998 ) depressed and sullen as dozens of happy thrill seekers are hurried past us all,  I curse the poor phone signal... I mean its not like being underneath 443 feet of glass and steel might impair a 4G signal, it must be my phone - the attendant laughs in my face and points at me and my family ""HAHAHAHA she says you must go back to the ticket office HAHAHA..."" ( actually she didnt laugh but she was to good customer service what 'The Waterboy' is to the cinematic arts... ( BAD - the customer service was bad just to be clear ) So I ask to see a supervisor or manager all the time smiling and waving my arms like i'm Madonna 'Vogueing' my heart out desperately calling out to the future.. to the invention of a magic box that can send an invisible data signal to a mobile device, you know the one, you can get them in Tandys ( ermm on Amazon ) its called a wireless router or WIFI for the acronym obsessed Gen-X.The outcome of all my efforts... my grumbling, my being a nuisance, my arm waving was... I got a moments 4g signal and after what seemed like the wait for my 56k modem load up my MySpace profile but was probably just 5 mins we got in... Brilliant....However the Japanese family behind us didnt... after waiting in line patiently like the good and polite people they were they were sent back to the ticket office to start again... London-Eye - I say to you,  sort your WiFi out people ! But lets be friends and not fall out,  what's your handle maybe we can meet up in a MSN chatroom... or are you AOL ? I bet your AOL... nevermind...",Great Views
"August 16, 2017",This now iconic attraction on the south bank is worthy of a visit on a fine day as you will get views of London that are difficult to find unless you can get in nearby high rise offices. Expensive though so see if you can get deal or voucher and book beforehand if you can. ,Good experience
"August 16, 2017",We were there for summer vacation. We bought our open time fast-tract tickets online. The staffs were helpful and will answer most of your questions effectively...It was a great experience to ride on the London Eye....,Miss
"August 15, 2017","A great experience for all the family, I would definitely recommend this attraction if visiting London.",Slightly above average
"August 15, 2017","Nothing extraordinary view, its like a must to tick off on your been there done that list. Queve times around 20-30 mins. Didnt bother with priority ticket. Done it once, would definetly not go again. Big focus on selling merchandise, unfortunately. ",Poor Information and Customer Service
"August 14, 2017","My husband and I bought VIP skip the line and Champagne experience for the London Eye from their website on the 20th April this year, and although we weren't advised nor notified, our tickets had a 90 day time limit to be used within. The customer service team at London Eye were very inconsiderate and didn't send us a warning email notifying us that our tickets were about to be out of date and secondly, didn't offer us any kind of refund or extended tickets despite not being aware of an expiry date. Simply horrible customer service.Won't be visiting again.",Loved it
"August 14, 2017","Brought my 8 year old for the first time. She loved it. The new 4design experience is fun but very short. Hadetails fast track tickets and got on second pod at 930am although my tickets said 10am so arrive early and enjoy. Views of palace of Westminster,  big Ben and buckingham palace are amazing.",Wonderful Experience 
"August 14, 2017",London Eye is a must do!!! My husband and I enjoyed the entire ride ❤️You truly can appreciate the entire view from there. ,Amazing view
"September 7, 2017","That's about it. there's nothing special, only a great view and it is a very long ride (because it is slow). Big line to go to the attraction! ",Horrendous queues!!
"September 7, 2017",Biggest mistake visiting during school holidays absolutely horrendous waiting time and queues was not enjoyable at all squashed in a capsule/pod with pretty much as many people that they could put it not enjoyable at all. Will go off peak if I visit again at a quiet time ,A site to see literally!
"September 5, 2017","Since I had never visited London before everyone advised me that I have to do this.  The price is steep for a ferris wheel type ride, however the views you can see are remarkable.  I would suggest you pay the extra money to experience all the ""eye"" can see.",Expensive but interesting
"September 5, 2017","So this is a great way to see the city of London but is quite expensive for the quick trip. Having said that if you are going to spend the money I would pay the extra 10£ and buy a ""fast track"" ticket to avoid the queue.",Great views
"September 3, 2017","Pick your time. You don't want to be waiting forever to get on this. And hunt down some 2 for 1 offers, or at least discounted tickets. If you manage these two things then this is going to be a super sweet experience. It's an iconic landmark with a great view and a must do while visiting London.",Super fun
"August 31, 2017",Buy time specific tickets as it safes a lot of waiting time.  Very comfortable and great views of the Big Ben and surrounding area.,Fantastic 
"August 30, 2017","Myself, my husband & 2 children recently went on the London Eye. We all thought it was brilliant. We paid with Tesco clubcard vouchers which was handy as I think it's highly priced otherwise. Views are amazing & would definitely recommend a visit.","Interesting, a Bit Disappointing"
"August 26, 2017","We arrived 15 minutes after attraction opened and there was already a bit of a long line, so be prepared. The line moved fairly quickly, though. The ride takes you to the top in which you see the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, Thames River, the Shard and other buildings in the center. However, having seen all these buildings already, I thought it was a bit disappointing. Nothing different from higher view, I thought.",Great views of London!
"August 26, 2017",Very happy we decided to do the London eye. The views are spectacular and present some wonderful photo opportunities. Be sure to purchase your tickets in advance and to pay extra for the expedited entrance. It will save you lots of time and aggravation. We did so online before departing the US. ,Good view of river and big ben
"August 25, 2017",Goes very slowly. I have height problem. Still did not feel dizzyy. Nice view. This time we got a day view. Next time will see night view.,Nice experience. Highly recommended

"September 13, 2017",This is a great attraction that has great views of London. Best to book in advance as can be quite busy.,Exaggerated
"September 12, 2017","I must say, this was one of the things tourists do while they Visit London. To me, the London eye experience was not as much as I expected it to be. It felt like there were a lot of people in each bubble and that there's no etiquette about how to be, act, and do things from taking pictures to loudness. I don't think I would ever be on that thing or even advise anyone to be on it. I don't see what the big deal is about going up and down.",Not worth the price
"September 10, 2017",A bit expensive. Like most of the sightseeings and things to so..Just Thirty minutes of Big wheel to take a few pictures. This is not a must see must do it. ,A Big Ferris Wheel
"September 10, 2017","This is one of the attractions in London, essentially a big ferris wheel. It's at a pier and there are other activities that you can do there. We didn't actually ride since the line was long and it was hot the day we were there. There are a lot of photo places that you can take a picture to get that Instagram shot.",Spectacular view of London
"September 10, 2017",This was well worth it. We loved the 360 degree view of London.  We went late in the day  (5:30 pm) so there was no line.  This time of year it closes early (6pm) so make sure you sure allow enough time.,Ho hum visit
"September 9, 2017","Nice view, but a bit of a boring ride. I would not say anything to recommend this ride. My wife and I were both very disappointed.",Perfect way to start our London Trip
"September 8, 2017","My almost 7 year old son and I went to London this summer. We went on The London Eye on the afternoon of our arrival to get a feel for the city. I'm usually not a fan of heights, but the encloses pod made me feel totally secure. It wasn't too crowded, but still very busy. I thought it a little pricey for 30 minutes of entertainment (the reason for the 4 stars), but it was a great way to start our trip. We were able to point out some of the other places we were planning to visit. ",The Viator Champagne Tour
"July 25, 2017","We did the Viator Champagne tour of the London Eye. You got to skip the line, have a cocktail (out of pocket) in the Eye Lounger before boarding the capsule and having champagne with a view (included with ticket).",Great views of London that you won't see anywhere else!
"July 24, 2017",The London Eye was a great experience. They don't cramp too many people in to each carriage which is awesome because you can move around freely and see the views from each side. Beware: the only toilets nearby you have to pay for so go in a restaurant if you have lunch or before you leave! We also couldn't find anywhere to fill up our drink bottles and were there on a 30 degree day! Overall an awesome experience!,One of the best views of London
"July 22, 2017","Revolves slowly so that you can take as much photographs or video shoots as you can. Takes around half hour, this is the most visited site in London. Pre book your ride since it is usually sold out especially on weekends.",a view
"July 19, 2017","I was reluctant to visit the Eye, but I found a 2-for-1 deal with National Rail Service - one person purchases a ticket and another person gets in free if they have Rail Service travel cards for that day.Best advice, book in advance and research the 2-for-1 deal on the UK National Rail Service so that you miss the long lines and get a better price. A nighttime visit is better.",Amazing
"July 19, 2017",A great attraction. Worth paying for the fast track to avoid the huge queue. My confirmation email did not have any content but when I went to collect my tickets there were no problems and I was dealt with very quickly. ,Fun on the Eye
"July 17, 2017","What a terrific vantage point to look down on so many of the tourist sites - parliament, the river Thames, Big Ben and more.  Well worth the visit.  Take the fast track option",Great view of the city
"July 16, 2017","It's pricey and tons of people go there, but seeing the city from that high up is pretty awesome. Recommended for first-time visitors to the city. ",Guess You Have to Do Once
"July 15, 2017","If you are visiting London for the first time I guess this is one of those things you must do.  We purchased the fast pass online the day before.  Ticket downloaded to phone, worked great.  Expensive, but when traveling time is money.  I would not book this more than a day in advance as weather will be key to your enjoyment.  If you want to que, go early, but that applies to all the sites.  Best to check the weather and pick the best day for this.",Nice view
"July 14, 2017","It is a nice view in London, but not a thing that you could not to do. If you have a short time, the length of the line is a problem, but was nice. Near the London eye was happening a African fair with some delicious things to eat.",Great views of a great city.
"July 14, 2017","Organised and pretty easy to get aboard, we paid for the fast track service but we still had to queue for a little while. It was busy as usual but the pods were not crowded and you could move about easily and study London in every direction....a marvellous engineering addition to the London Skyline...put it on your to do list!",ok
"May 27, 2017","its ok though a little pricey, very sedate views of london.  depending on what you are looking to see ","just awefully long waiting, but worth it"
"May 27, 2017","We where here during summer, which obviousely is the time many tourists visit London, had to wait for a whole 2 hours or so, by the time we finally got to go on the ride we were out of energy. I have been on twice, in different years, so it is definately a must try in London, but beware of the waiting time and plan to take food or snack or something, you are not allowed or able at all to leave the line, since there are ropes around the line, so it's important to at least take some water during warm days.Good view, camera ia advices to take with you, and walk around and see the different angles and views. ",Historical. Movies. Fun in the sun!
"May 26, 2017","Lovely iconic must visit in London. This place will take you back to all the awesome movies you have watched all your life. Very suitable for all types of visits. Families, kids, couples, friends, even solos!",Not such a big deal
"May 26, 2017",You will wait for hours to get up there and the view is unremarkable. It is over priced and underwhelming,Must do
"May 23, 2017","Although quite expensive, it is definitely something you can't miss while in London! Everyone will love it! Great fun for the whole family!",Over rated
"May 23, 2017","We had to wait in very very long line, people who are working there were not really friendly, became a bit expensive regarding to the needed time and cash.If you have much free time then try it.I loved the show with this 4D cinima as a way from them not to keep you waiting. ",Champagne London eye experience
"May 21, 2017",Had this experience booked for a 60th birthday present very poor organisation getting prepaid tickets booked for 1pm but queues so long missed slot and had to wait till 3pm for next available trip although we had allowed time to collect tickets ! Seems strange you can't print off tickets at home before you board. However staff at kiosk were  polite and helpful and young lady who was our host on the champagne trip made the whole experience an unforgettable one. ,Crazy Busy
"May 21, 2017",Nice on a clear day. Nothing really special other than seeing some of the notable close-by landmarks from above. Be ready to spend 20 - 30 minutes in a capsule with 15 or so strangers. ,A must go
"May 21, 2017",I've already been there twice and both times I've chose to go up just before sunset so we had this beautiful colours in the sky and the perfect pictures of the city going dark with all the lights from the buildings around river Thames going on. Incredible experience.,Nice views
"May 19, 2017",The best decision was to take the fast track tickets. The whole experience was nice and the view of London from the top is beautiful. I personally think the price is a bit higher than it actually deserves. ,Nice view!
"May 18, 2017","If the weather is clear, i do recomend a visit. You will have a nice view of London. The capsule you travel is super safe and even the one´s that don´t like heights will be confortable siting in the middle of the capsule (which is totaly closed).",What a tourist night mare
"May 17, 2017","We went there on a Saturday around noon - the place was overcrowded with tourists running around without any sort of guidance. Went in to buy normal ticket, but the line was so long, that after some time we gave that up and looked for the Fast Lane office.Even that lane was long - and it moved even slower that the normal one - seemed to have only a few to sell the quite more expensive tickets.......So no - not a place for us.",Queue isn't as bad as it seems
"May 17, 2017","Queues look unreal but it does go in fairly quickly, so I wouldn't let that dishearten you.  There's so much down there with the London aquarium, London dungeons and the Shrek adventures so you can easily spend hours here anyway. We bought the ticket that gave us access to the London eye, Madame Tussaud's and the Aquarium. What a fantastic buy.",A memorable experience
"May 17, 2017","This is a definite must when visiting London, one of the best attractions, well organised, and a truly memorable experience. If you have the opportunity go and see the 3D show as well, its fantastic.",Disappointed 
"May 16, 2017","If you really want to have a great view... go to the Shard for 30 pounds you can have two cocktails :) The London eyes is just a tourist attraction, an expensive one. ",Over rated and over priced.
"May 15, 2017","The London eye is one of those "" Oh you must do it "" things in London that you look back on and wonder why you got so involved with the hype, yes you get some nice views, but it really made me feel as though I was at movie world or some other really commercial attraction, long lines, so if you must go for the ride probs a good idea to pre book.",I finally got to go on the London Eye!
"May 14, 2017",We went on the London Eye on Saturday the 13th of May. It took us a minuet to find the right queue but there were many workers there to ask for help just so many different queues! We thought it was great to see that there were accessibility for disabled users.We were told to go to point B and to us the queue looked rather large but thinking about it now it was probably not what it is like when it was really busy. We ended up queuing for 40 minuets which we all thought was impressive for a Saturday so we expected worse - we were very glad it was not raining! It was rather annoying that there were two queue jumpers but I cannot blame the staff for that as there was no one near enough to see it and you cannot help rudeness.The staff once we got to the eye were great and helpful. They were very efficient and helpful. It also made us feel more secure to see how seriously they took the security. We went up on a clear day meaning we could see pretty far. There was an interactive screen where you could look at what you were actually seeing. The views were great and personally I loved getting to see London in a new way. I'm not sure how long we were on the Eye but it felt about right. It was worth the queue and the money we spent in our opinion.,Did not meet expectations 
"May 14, 2017","The whole experience of the event was underwhelming.I expected spectacular views but maybe it was the weather. Very touristy, seems they are more geared towards the tourists. ",Champagne Experience 
"May 13, 2017",Great way to see the city and kick off your trip in London. I highly recommend purchasing the champagne experience. You get two glasses of champs and skip the line! ,Nice but crowded
"May 13, 2017","Nice attraction, good view of London especially if you are lucky to be there in a sunny day. Prices are high but if you purchase the tickets along with another attraction you can get a good discount.Instead of being a must do attraction in London, you must be prepared to stand some time in lines. So, if you dont have much time, i suggest you visiting a museum.",Worst customer service and no trip
"April 29, 2017","If I could give this review zero stars I would - The worst customer service and experience to date.We purchased tickets in advance (March) for a particular date and had the voucher ready to exchange for fast track tickets. The voucher stated the date and that we needed to reedeem them by 6pm, no other terms or conditions were specifiedWe paid for 24 hour parking in Birmingham and purchased train tickets for this particular experience. We arrived at the venue just after 3pm (plenty of time, or so we thought) only to be told that there were no more tickets that day and to return tomorrow when they could book a ticket for around 2.30. WHAT???????????? We had purchased tickets for a specific date, we had travelled over 100 miles to be there and it appeared that our tickets had been resold.Could we get a refund? apparently not, we were told to just tell the online agent that we hadn't been able to take up the experience. We asked how could we prove we hadn't used the voucher, eventually we were handed a sheet of paper and told to ""scan it and e.mail it to the vendor""I asked how they could sell our tickets if we had purchased the voucher for a specific date online, surely it's like any booking facility, some tickets are made available to vendors (which we used) and others are sold on the day, quite simple I would have thought.Could anyone give a reason why the tickets were not there? No, only ""it's been busy""Were they sympathetic? No - all we got was ""come back tomorrow"" Wasted train journey, wasted tickets (purchased over a month ago), wasted car parking fees, and a spoiled day. Not even a decent apology - Dreadful!My recommendation to anyone thinking of going here - don't bother",Ok.
"April 29, 2017",On the must do list of things to do while in London. Was ok but I think the Sky Garden views were  better. ,Mesmerising experience
"April 26, 2017","Thought it would not be interesting but I was totally wrong, buy a view guide to see all the buildings from a great view and height. If you can catch the sunset on the ride this is amazing. Only draw back is if you buy your tickets on the day expect long delays, in the school holidays you can take a couple of hours to get onto the eye. Buy before if you can. ",Over-priced Rip-off
"April 25, 2017","I visited in mid April. Even so, the line-ups were staggering. I can't imagine what the crowds are like in summer. I bought my ticket online the night before £31.45 = $55.00 CD, so didn't have to wait two hours!! They insist that you first watch a 4D movie which I thought would be about the construction of it and various other facts. Instead it was basically a 5-min. advert for Coca-Cola, since they are not allowed to advertise along the Thames. Twice I was confronted by professionals who wanted to take my photo to sell to me later. I refused and they were horrified. The ride itself is a very slow-moving view of a not terribly interesting area of the Thames South Bank. The duration was approximately 15 minutes of riders crowding for the best views and remaining there so they could take pictures. I was embarrassed that I'd been sucked into such a silly scam. Even children in my pod were bored after the first few minutes. Don't get taken in. There are far more worthwhile attractions for your hard-earned cash in this amazing city.",Fast track well worth the extra money 
"April 22, 2017","An iconic tourist attraction which is very very popular. We booked online combining it with a trip to the London Dungeons which is literally 2 minutes walk away. We opted to collect our tickets from the venue and had booked a time slot. The web site does not give you an option for time slot for the dungeons so if anyone uses this facility bear this in mind. In addition when you collect your tickets, despite the staff saying you couldn't ... you can book your time slot at your other attraction. I spent time sprinting from location to location trying to sort timings. And queuing .... this brings me nicely on to the queue. They are massive. Book fast track for the eye. It's worth it. There is no queue. You just jump on whenever you want. It enhances your experience. The eye is amazing. The views breathtaking. The experience not to be missed. ","Not what I was Expecting, But the View was Spectacular!"
"April 19, 2017","I honestly thought I had this planned out so we could get in line and do the ride without a hitch. Unfortunately I needed to go one step further. I bought the vouchers online for the ride, but I didn't finish by getting the tickets online before I was done. So, my friend and I ended up standing in line to get our tickets for the vouchers I'd paid for ahead of time. That took an hour.You have three lines at this ride. One to buy tickets when you get there (that's the longest line). One to turn in your online voucher to get your tickets for the ride. Then the line to get on the ride.After you get your tickets, they also have a 4-D film to watch that lasts about 5 minutes. If you want to take the time. It is a history of how the Eye came to be.They have security at the beginning checking to see if you have tickets to get on the ride. Then security before you go on the ride checking people with wands like at the airport. It took us an hour to get the tickets, then another hour to get on the ride. The line to the ride was continually moving, but it still took an hour to get on.The ride never stops unless someone in a wheelchair or otherwise handicapped needs to board. Then they stop the ride long enough for those people to get on safely.They board twelve people per pod.There is a center bench that people can sit on to enjoy the view. Or you can walk around the glass enclosure and get a panoramic view of London. From beginning to end the ride takes about 30 minutes once you are actually on the ride itself.It has a wonderful 360 degree view of London and you can take some wonderful pictures.We were there in February and it was busy enough then. I really wouldn't want to try going there in the middle of summer. It's probably a madhouse.They have a couple of gift shops for souvenirs. Mostly aimed at the kids. But there are a few items adults would enjoy.So this is one of the many tourist things to do. And a lot of people enjoy just sitting and looking at the view.But be sure to buy your tickets online and save yourself the misery of having to stand in line to get tickets, Even in February, with all the bodies in the building buying tickets, it was very hot in there.",Kind of a Must-Do Whilst In London
"April 18, 2017","It's a Ferris Wheel. In the end, that's all it really is.It's fun for a family trip to London. Our kids (ages 11 and 13) really enjoyed it, but it's certainly a ""do it once in your life and probably never again."" Definitely not something I'd feel the need to do again in future visits. The views really are incredible though (especially of Big Ben, Parliament, and St. Paul's Cathedral, and especially in the evening light.) The gondolas themselves are spacious and not over-crowded, and if you get a nice group of people in yours, everyone takes turns at the ""best"" windows and takes photos on each other's cameras. Coca-Cola sponsorship creates a bit of a carnival atmosphere (the line is required to go through a kiosk selling stuff including Coke drinks, and there's a mandatory group photo that you can buy later). The lines are HUGE, and we were glad to be able to spend the extra money on Fast-Track tickets.All in all, a very smooth ride that lasts about a half hour. We had planned to do this toward the beginning of our trip as an overview/welcome to London; instead, it worked out better to do it toward the end as a goodbye. Either way is totally fine.We purchased our tickets as part of a package with one of the HOHO bus tours. Be aware that you get a voucher that needs to be exchanged for actual tickets. We got there one evening to find this out, and found out that the tickets for that day were already sold out. The staff there was very friendly and helped us on a Wednesday exchange our voucher for tickets on a Saturday. From there, it was smoother sailing.",Great view
"April 17, 2017",Great view of the city. I would recommend the VIP experience with champagne! Go little bit early to have an extra cocktails away from all the tourist. ,Great View
"April 16, 2017","This was a great start to our London vacation. We pre booked the champagne experience, and this lets you skip all of the lines. It would have been better if there had been better directions as to where to go to show the tickets, but we found our way. We had a 14:00 (2:00pm) time, and were directed to the private bar area to wait. Our guide was late, which was annoying, but eventually arrived and took us to the eye where we bypassed the lines and went right in. It was great to get a bird's eye perspective of the city to get our bearings. It was a beautiful, clear afternoon...and the champagne on board was a nice touch. It would have been perfect had the escort not been so late, and if the majority of the other 24 passengers in our car hadn't been a bachelorette party! But I would definitely recommend this.",Champagne Experience
"April 16, 2017",Went on the Champagne Experience package for my wife's birthday and it's definitely the way to do the London Eye! The pod only has half as many people which is great and obviously having a drink on your way round is good. Tip: make sure you collect your ticket from inside at the VIP Experience desk!,London Eye with kids
"April 11, 2017","The London Eye gives a great sense of the city. Get there early because the lines are long, even with ""fast pass"" type of tickets. My children loved pointing out all of the buildings and sites. Great stop for families!",Classic view of London
"April 11, 2017","This is a gentle experience, allowing the visitor the opportunity to experience the (in my opinion) classic London view.  You can easily see House of Parliament, Big Ben, St Paul's Cathedral etc.  Only downside is it took us one hour to queue before getting on but I think this is to be expected at a major attraction.",Best views of London!
"April 10, 2017","If you're looking for the ""touristy"" thing to do you have to do The London Eye!   Amazing views of the city.  And spend the extra $$ for fast track to beat any long lines!",Not very organised!
"April 10, 2017",We had 10 booked for the champagne experience but due to huge queues couldn't get our tickets in time so missed out and wasn't allowed the champagne. Also the fast track wasn't very fast. But once on it the views were spectacular. Just a shame they couldn't be more accommodating- esp as we were on a hen Do!!!,Great experience
"April 10, 2017","Fab experience a must when you visit London, expect to queue, but the queue's do move relatively quick, the pods do hold quite a few people, the views are fantastic, book online or with an attraction deal.",The Icon of London
"April 7, 2017",We have booked this from golden bus tours for 22.5 pound each. They gave a slip which we need to produce at the ticket counter to get the actual ticket. This took around 30 minutes.Along with the London eye ticket there was a complimentary 4D show. We waited for roughly 20 mins to board the wheel. Each pod accommodated roughly 10 people.We went after sunset . It has magnificent view of Thames and major London's attractions. Try to avoid on foggy weather. We did it at the last and it proved to be a right decision as we were able to pin point majority of the attractions from the top. Although its costly and crowded still a must to do in London.,Amazing
"April 6, 2017",The london eye is deffo a must see attraction when in london! You are able to look out onto the city and see different landmarks which was amazing! The eye goes round slowely so you are able to take it all in and it also offers the chance to take photos and also take a group photo when inside. There are long ques to get onto the eye but these go down very quickly and the staff have everything well organised. Verg pleased with how it all worked.,Fun visit
"April 5, 2017","This was my second visit to the London eye and I loved it each time. I highly recommend visiting mid week and off peek times so that you can get a chance to ride. You get amazing views of the city Thames River, Parliament and Big Ben.",Does what it's supposed to
"April 2, 2017","We have Merlin Passes and were in London so it seemed daft not to visit the eye.We only queued for about 15 minutes in what seemed like a busy period. It's all very slick getting people on and off, particularly the volume of people.On the Eye itself was as expected. Fantastic views and good information available about what you are looking at. Haven't given it 5 stars as if we'd paid then it would seem quite expensive for half an hour (although heaven knows what it cost to erect and to run)!! But it is what it is so 4 stars is more than fair I'd say and if I was in the area again with the Merlin Pass I'd go again.",Fun for the first five minutes
"March 30, 2017",I did enjoy it but it got boring pretty quick. The initial excitement and the view from the top were good. The 4D experience afterwards was charming.,Fun first time or repeat customer!
"March 24, 2017","We arrived right @11 which is when they start selling tickets. The long line goes quick as there are multiple customer service agents to assist you. The ticket price is fairly hefty (25 pounds sterling per person), but the views from the top are unparalleled. Great for a first time tourist, or repeat traveler.  This was our second time at the Eye, and we enjoyed it just as much as the first time.",Get there Early!
"March 22, 2017",Officially opens at 11am. We were in the line at 10am and already 200-300 people ahead of us. The price is higher than the carousel goes.I was a leisurely 30 minutes rotation. We felt completely safe at all times. And the views are amazing from the different angles.,Over priced
"March 22, 2017","I think the London eye is a bit expensive. I'm glad I have experienced it, but I wouldn't do it again. It's not very exciting and there isn't that much to see at the top apart from buildings! Very long queues so buy tickets online to save about 30 mins in the ticket queue",Long wait for an average view.
"March 22, 2017",After a long one and a half hour wait in drizzly weather it was a rather dissapointing view with other passengers reluctant to move around the pod to allow others to view different directions. we had initially gone in the morning first thing as we had purchased an anytime ticket but 40 minutes after the advertised opening time we were still waiting tfor some action - no lines no staff giving any direction. Came back later in the day and a long wait in dismal weather. Had missed out on seeing some more worthwhile sights whilst waiting. ,Disappointed by lack of care and attention. 
"March 21, 2017","Being disabled, my husband booked for us to have the champagne experience in the bar beforehand, so that I would be able to have a leisurely sit prior to being taken to priority boarding onto the eye itself. We arrived a little early so we could make the most of sitting and watching the boats on the Thames, but when we arrived we tried to find the bar but couldn't so enquired with the main ticket booths as the priority desk wasn't manned. They told us to wait until the priority desk opened but couldn't tell us when that woukd be. There was no seating available, so we finally flagged down another staff member and she very helpfully went to find out what was happening. During this time staff arrived to open the priority desk and when she returned she was inforned  that the bar was closed for refurbishment so the pre- champagne experience wasn't available any more. It was news to them as they hadn't been informed and it was news to us too as my husband had only booked it two weeks prior! She advised us to go for a walk and return later, easier said than done when you're struggling with mobility! Anyway, we had a slow walk around but returned as I was feeling unwell. As there was no seating I propped myself up against a wall, but eventually had to ask staff for a chair... I was bought a wheelchair! I've spent years trying to stay out of a wheelchair, but had no option at this point. After a while we were taken out to the eye (minus the wheelchair as there were steps down from the reception area). The priority boarding area for alighting was blocked off as they were working on it, so we were taken via the fast track method, which cut down the very long queue by about half, but still meant walking up two long ramps and queuing behind the others in fast track. (There appears to be three methods of obtaining access onto the eye: priority with it's own entrance, fast track where they open a gate halving the queue and normal, where you take your chances on the day.) When we got on, the pod was great and the view sensational.  The interactive maps are a great idea and we thoroughly enjoyed that part of the experience, albeit rather painful! By the end though I was too ill and tired to continue our weekend so we caught a taxi, took some more medication and headed home back to Yorkshire. Such a let down from somewhere you really would expect to be, a) better informed, and b) more disabled friendly. The motto: phone in advance to check there are no unscheduled hold ups and hope they have informed their staff accordingly. Poor show London Eye!!!",Worst visitor experience ever
"March 21, 2017","Booked this for my parents, the champagne experience to reduce queuing time and was glad about this - the 'fastrack' queue was almost as long as the regular queue. We hung around an unmarked area - no seats for anyone with any disability or reduced mobility - as we were told that we'd be collected soon. But what was worst was the person 'in charge' of our group left without making any announcement the group was leaving the building and as one of our party was using the bathroom at the time, we just saw the group exit the door and then we had to try find them in the crowds of people queuing outside. Communication between staff to try find the group was appauling - all we were told was 'you've missed your group's slot' and we were just fortunate that we spotted our guide. Worst tourist experience ever. ",The waiting was horrible
"March 21, 2017",The waiting queues were horrible. There were people waiting for over 3 houres to get on The Londen Eye. We wanted to go on it but it was not worth the wait.,Birthday treat
"March 19, 2017",First time on the London eye and was very good. The que is very very long but goes down quite quickly. Views are really nice too. This is something we probley wouldn't do again just because we have done it now and no point doing it again.  ,Enjoyable 
"March 18, 2017",The London Eye was very wonderful. We did that as the last excursion so we could point out everywhere we went during our stay. Seeing London beneath you was just amazing. ,Beautiful views at night!
"March 15, 2017","Worth the trip, especially at night....Best to book on line & skip some of the line.  (Note: add champagne to package and avoid 'kids')",Wonderful night view
"February 10, 2017","No surprises here! A fairly expensive ticket gets you an excellent view. You likely know your families preferences and value/reward spectrum. If you really want to ""get your money's worth"" and are hyper sensitive to expense....this probably isn't the ride for you. If you spend money freely for experiences on vacation, then this is another solid option. I'll likely give ""The Shard"" a look next time. ",Great view
"February 5, 2017",Great view but the there was a crazy quew to get in. It is a nice experience to see London from the top but there are many other places that can give you the same view.,Worth the wait!
"February 4, 2017",Even though I am scared of heights I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The views are out of this world! We queued about 45 mins to get on with standard passes. Staff very efficient. ,Enormous queue
"January 29, 2017","The London eye is brilliant,the only thing letting it down is the queuing system. I have previously visited on a weekday and walked straight on. This time I visited on a Saturday afternoon and was obviously expecting it to be much busier. I reserved tickets online and was told to expect around a 45 minute queue. The queue to collect the tickets was around 1 hour and then the queue to get on was another 2 hours. I even missed the train home. The queue is grim, outside on the pavement with overflowing bins. A better queuing system is badly needed. Its a shame as its an amazing attraction and the views at night are beautiful.",Wow
"January 19, 2017","To be honest, I thought it would be boring with long queues and poor views. I was wrong. First thing in the morning is often quiet and our weight was less than 20 minutes. We could see all that there was to see. Usually souvenirs are poor quality and expensive. We were pleasantly surprised that they were far better than expected. Souvenir photographs are usually a rip off, so it was totally unexpected,that the price included a hard back book to hold the pictures.I thoroughly recommend the trip.",See the city from a unique view
"January 19, 2017",Well worth the time. Breathtaking views. Top attraction if you like a perspective from the air. Really enjoyed it.,Beautiful views
"January 19, 2017",Visited the London eye with friends on a hen do. The queues were long but went down very quickly. There were lots of beautiful views of London. I think it's one of those experiences that once you have done it once there would be no need to do it again but defiantly worth having one go on it.,Enjoy from across the Thames
"January 18, 2017",The experience was fine however not worth the money.  The area around the eye is very crowded and although we didn't wait in the queue I don't feel it was worth in.,Great eye experience 
"January 15, 2017",Just after the new year our family was given the ride the eye and river thames tours. As long as the line was the staff was well organized and efficient. It took 30 minutes to get on and we had a nice experience. The weather was partly sunny and we could see for miles. Both my girls were not scared at all. Thx it was fun and so was the 40 minutes on the river.,New Years Eve
"January 14, 2017",Visited here for New Years Eve and it really was an amazing experience! The fireworks went off for around 10 minutes and were absolutely spectacular!There was a DJ that played music and hyped up the crowd!Is defiantly something that everyone must experience!!,There are more important places to visit in London
"February 16, 2017","Londons eye view is always a perfect experience but you still have more and cheaper ways to enjoy it, ideally with a drink at one of the skyscrapers",Wedding proposal
"February 15, 2017",Lovely wedding proposal venue!You take great pics too!Ride is 30 minutes enough so you don't get bored,London eye and river cruise
"February 15, 2017",Excellent venue. Even though visibility wasn't perfect due to weather the views were great. River cruise was very enjoyable. Worth a trip. The guide in the river cruise was excellent and very informative.,"Definitely would recommend, but expensive at full price"
"February 15, 2017","We purchased as part of a 2 attraction pass so only worked out to be £10 each. Good value for £10 each but expensive at full price. There are so many discounts for the Eye that nobody should be paying full price.We went on a busy day, but later in the afternoon so the crowds were low. Waited 20 minutes, but this is good for London.We did the 4D experience first, but wasnt to impressed with it. I think its just a way to try to justify the full price ticket prices. Would recommend just missing it.The Eye itself is great. Lasts 30 minutes and even in the poor weather we had was still good.I read some previous poor reviews and had to laugh at some comments.   'Takes ages to go around' - Well thats the idea, if you want a fast ride then go to a theme park.   'bad idea if you need the toilet' - If you cant last an hour without the toilet, then see the doctor.   'boring' - Its meant to be relaxing, away from the choas of London streets. If you cant stand still and enjoy a few minutes piece and quiet, then dont get on.",Eye of the world
"February 14, 2017","Fantastic experience,  a must see and do when you are in London,  will be taking my granddaughter to London in July and will be going on the London Eye again with my granddaughter. ",Amazing attraction
"February 13, 2017",This is a must to see London! We booked out tickets online and paid for priority tickets. I recommend this as the queue for normal ticket looked very long that would take about an hour to hour and half to get through. The staff were very polite and the view were amazing. The day we went on was slightly foggy but still saw the beauty of London. The only down point was the purchase a photo was £20 for one which we felt was pretty steep. Apart from that amazing and we loved it. ,Amazing
"February 13, 2017","We had trouble initially booking tickets to go on the eye, as when we tried to use the website on our phones you couldn't just buy a ticket to go on the eye it was only offering package deals i.e with a river cruise or a valentines champagne package.  When we eventually figured it out we decided to leave it till our last afternoon as you could pick a time slot, we chose 13:15 - 13:45 as we had a train to catch at 16:10.  When we arrived to pick our tickets up we were told to go outside and wait in the queue and it would take roughly an hour which as a bit strange considering we picked a time slot which turns out is only to pick up the tickets not enter the ride.  So just be a bit careful.",Great views from the eye
"February 13, 2017",Worth booking in advance as the queues for last minute tickets can stretch for what looks like miles!! Once on the pod the journey is really smooth and as it travels slowly so the view constantly changes. As it reaches the top the views are amazing across London and I would say do not miss the chance to go on the London Eye if you have never done it before.,Must Do!
"February 12, 2017",The queues can look quite daunting but they are very well organised and move quickly. The pods themselves are spacious and they don't load too many people into each one so you can move about and take in the 360 degree views of the City. There are tablets which you can use to find out about the Landmarks you can see. It is well worth the money (as long as it isn't foggy) and I'd recommend doing it during the day and of a night as London is just as beautiful then.,Great area to visit for a family
"February 11, 2017",We took our kids to the London Eye. Don't use Apple maps to get you there. It will send you to the hospital nearby. The views are beautiful and definitely get the pictures afterward. Well worth it!,Great views... very romantic
"December 8, 2016",An amazing time especially on a clear day. Need to make sure that you wrap up though - London is cold. Beautiful during the night.,Eye in the sky!
"December 6, 2016",This is a must! You can see everything on a clear day. If possible try and get your own pod. Or wait for the next pod if there are children and strollers.,Great views
"December 5, 2016","I will say, the London Eye had amazing views of the city. The 4-D show prior was a nice addition. just somehow, I expected more. I think it is a pretty high price to pay for what you get. That being said, it is a neat experience, and my kids loved the interactive i-pads that showed them where the landmarks they were interested in were located.","A must ""touristy"" attraction "
"December 4, 2016","Despite being cheesy and a total tourist trap, the Eye is the great way to kill an hour and see the bird's eye view of London. I've done it twice and enjoyed it both times. ",Terrible commentary
"December 1, 2016","The Eye itself - well run, good views (if it is not cloudy) and only downside is the Coca Cola livery that obscures the views in the capsules. Wonderfully, there is no commentary so you can just stand in the capsule and look out. The river cruise run by the same people was ruined by a terrible commentary by a gushing young female with a voice that was aping ageing TV star Davina McCall. Truly annoying stuff from Sheira. Most of it was irrelevant and it included a huge plug for a restaurant called Coppa. Dull stuff. Yes, we all want to sit on a boat in the Thames to hear about a restaurant - that's exactly what we all paid for. Good views from the boat (any boat in fact) just book a different one.",You Gotta Do It!
"December 1, 2016","When in London, you have to go on the Eye. We bought tickets in advance. I would highly recommend because lines can be really long. The staff was efficient and polite. The Eye moves slowly, so it doesn't make you dizzy. The glass cars  are large enough that you have a chance to look at the city from all sides. The views were beautiful.  far as touristy attractions go, this was one of my favorites.",A must do while in London
"November 27, 2016","I originally wasn't going to do the London Eye while I was in London last July but, the sun come out so I decided to do it. Very glad I did. Line moved quickly and wait time was about 20 minutes. Views were amazing, great way to see London when you don't have much time. I did the combo ticket with river cruise for only a few pounds more, worth it.",Great tour of london
"November 23, 2016",We had a nice tour in London and visited London eye. Great view from the wheel over London. The que was not that long and we had a nice tour in London and visited also other places.,Take at least the fast lane champagne experience
"November 22, 2016","We went on a Friday evening at 6 and the lines were quite long so invest a bit in the fast track with the champagne and drink before in the lounge. In that case you avoid queuing in the cold and get a hassle free entry and exit experience. The 4D movie you can also skip in my opinion, it´s nothing spectacular.  The views and the champagne in the Eye it self are a super combination.",Meh...
"November 22, 2016",Visited on a Tuesday afternoon. Attraction was quiet so no que. 4D film was uninspiring and didn't really see the point of it. London eye itself was over pretty quickly. We also did the View from the Shard and would recommend this as opposed to the London Eye. ,Perfect view
"October 24, 2020",The most amazing biew in London.Sometimes I think it is even better than the shard.waiting time was not long due to covid but really loved it.,2nd time on the London Eye
"October 24, 2020","Loved this as I am scared to death of heights, can recommend xx Such an amazing view from all sides x",Mr & Mrs Rothwell 
"October 23, 2020",Aj was a perfect host during our champagne eye experience .we would recommend this as a fantastic way to view London skyline ,Amazing views
"October 22, 2020",It was a rainy day when we visited :( no que's thanks to Covid 19!!  Pod to ourselves and enjoyed the sites from height across London. Be aware the 4D cinema is closed was not advised about this upon booking!!,Good
"October 22, 2020",Worth visit . Dont expect as it seen in pictures.  But worth . It's still open and people can take family pass,Wonderful Wonderful Day
"October 20, 2020",This was a good experience that turned into the most fantastic experience when at the very very top of the eye i asked my partner would she marry me and she said yes!!.She was so shocked and so was everyone in the capsule as well.,Fabulous experience
"October 20, 2020","We were a bit concerned to go as the lockdown restrictions had just been eased and the London Eye hadn’t been re-open for very long. We didn’t need to worry as the staff were very professional, and the whole process went smoothly. There were 7 of us in total in our pod which made the experience really special as we could see so much without being in the way of others. Our kids loved every minute and we’re so sad when the 30 minutes was up. What a fabulous experience!",Great
"October 19, 2020","15 years Since I First Went and Was Just Lovely All Over Again! Great Experience, Great Way To Experience London by Birds Eye View",Fantastic experience
"October 19, 2020","Absolutely fantastic experience and a good price too. The river cruise was made even better by jack ( tour guide) who has the same sense of humour as me. He really did make the trip funny, but most of all he knew his stuff and was very knowledgeable about the city’s history. Booking a slot for the London eye proved a little tricky, as the web site didn’t recognise my booking number. I had to go to the pier and chat with  the booking agents who booked the a slot. Luckily it wasn’t too bad as there were lots of slots available.All covid 19 restrictions followed and all staff wore masks at all times.Fantastic glad I booked this trip, would definitely recommend it.",Family Fun
"October 19, 2020",Great way to see the whole of London. Really enjoyable and relaxing! Takes about 25 minutes. Very COVID secure as well.,Love the view
"October 30, 2016",Every time I visit London I make sure that I visit London eye the view from the top is amazing you can see the river and all the major landmarks of London. That's suitable for all ages and I'm guessing the best time to visit would be right before sunset that would be very cool,Great views of London and a good experience
"October 29, 2016","My wife and I visited on a recent trip to London and choose the champagne experience. We were fast tracked to our pod but still had to queue when was a bit disappointing. However, our guide Arnie made the whole pod experience great with his knowledge and affable manner. It made the 30 min trip go quickly. We then went to our cocktail at the Eye Bar which seemed to be a pop-up bar in the London Eye building.All in all a good experience I would recommend.",Brilliant ...even if terrified of heights!!
"October 28, 2016","Second visit to the London Eye but did a twilight/night ride this time which was better for those with a fear of heights!!   We used our Merlin passes and were able to have priority whcih meant avoiding much queuing which was welcomed on such a busy half-term Oct afternoon.   Be prepared to get frisked, bag searched but all good and to be expected.Beautiful views on a clear dusk evening and saw many lit up landmarks of course, Big Ben and Houses of Parliament but also further afield too.Staff very friendly too.",Don't be upset if you miss it
"October 28, 2016",Its a London landmark and its fairly cheap especially if you mix it with other attractions. But if the queue is long and you have seen a sprawling city I would suggest not waiting in line for an hour for a 20 min ride but head to another attraction. Its average ,Have the champagne!
"October 27, 2016",The London Eye.  A worthwhile attraction particularly if you pay the NOMINAL upcharge to add champagne and go to the lounge.  SKIP THE LINE and have a great experience.  Two thumbs up.  ,Loved it!
"October 27, 2016",You can't visit London and go on the London Eye.  We went on at night and the views of the city all lit up were amazing.  We queued for about 20 minutes and weren't disappointed',Fun
"October 27, 2016",Good view from Above . we had great weather so clear views all around. Lots of photo shots and very smooth ride.,Champagne and breath-taking views!
"October 24, 2016",We decide to splurge and have the champagne tour- it was totally worth it. We also didn't have to wait in a cue- probably a function of the fact that it was 5 pm on a Wednesday in October but in reading other reviews I was surprised that we just walked right on at our reservation time. The views really are spectacular and it was the first thing we did after we checked into our hotel.  Great way to start off a wonderful trip.,The London Eye
"October 24, 2016",It is one of the landmark in London which you should visit it. They have tow types of tickets ( normal and VIP). You will see both Thames river sides. You will enjoy.,A must for first time with children
"October 23, 2016",Fantastic view of London from above. If you orderered your tickets by the internet first you have to get them from the ticket office and then stay on the second line to enter.,Really Amazing Structure! Well Worth a Visit! Great Views!
"October 19, 2016","This wheel is really an amazing feat of engineering. We purchased our tickets online in advance, which I would recommend. We also paid extra for the ""fast track"" tickets that allow users to cut the line, as well as the ""any time, any day"" option. This gave us flexibility in case it was raining or overcast. A handy thing since the queue area is not covered, and there was a long line for the stand by tickets. We were loaded into our capsule in a fairly short amount of time. There was approx. 20 people in the capsule and the wheel moves continuously. It's a very well run attraction. The views are really great. You can walk around in the capsule and take pictures. The capsule is air conditioned and the trip is very smooth. Would do it again when in the area.",panoramic views!
"October 18, 2016","I've been on this four times - My son enjoyed it when he was and it entertained us a couple of times more recently - and my husband wanted to experience it so we went on together. Don't be put off by the queues - it moves super fast. It is pricey for 30 minutes but you do get to see the whole of London and can recognise the sights. It is not frightening - even if you hate heights, although I see one review does not agree with this. The glass all around feels v safe and no, it does not swing about! The only odd bit is jumping on and off while it is in motion - the movement is very very slow and there is no way you could fall but psychologically a bit weird, like one of those paternoster lifts only slower. I liked seeing old London juxtaposed with new and you can see the tops of buildings - St Thomas's hospital and the whole of the river from a unique angle - you can see Buckingham Palace and even Canary Wharf. Get the 'Map' postcard to tell you what you are looking at. Don't bother if there are heavy clouds or fog though! (It's air-conditioned if it is hot!)",Amazig views of London
"October 18, 2016",Got to see London from above. If yoyu are afraid of height or claustrophobic don't try. It takes 30 minutes to go all they way around. You get breathtaking views from up above.,No good if you don't like heights
"October 18, 2016","We went on the London eye this summer.. we didn't queue for long and when we got on it , it travels really slow.. as the chamber started to climb I was ok until just over half way .. when we reached the top I felt so ill I had to sit down and it's a shame really as my husband took all the photos which he's not good at and I could only see what I had missed out on looking at a few photos... I wouldn't go on it again ad it's expensive for the ride . But at least I can now say I've done it..",Panoramic View of London
"October 18, 2016","Buy tickets online as part of the London Attraction. Take in amazing views of Thames River, Big Ben etc. After the half an hour ride.. take a stroll along the southbank where there are other attractions too..",The View!!
"October 17, 2016","I had the opportunity to finally see London from the top, and oh what a view!!!As a lover of a great architecture, London as it all. The House of Parliament, The Thames etc. Walking  distance to major train stations,shopping,restaurants  and other entertainments...",It's a big Wheel
"October 16, 2016","The problem with this attraction is that it's more impressive on the ground than it is on the wheel. the views are not great, the queue to enter is long and the price is high. Oh wheel, if you've not done it you my feel you've not 'done it', but be happy wondering what it's like from the embankment.","A nice experience, but definitely not worth the price"
"October 16, 2016","It's nice to see London from up above, but not for 25 pounds! I'll rather go to a nice restaurant...",A 'must see'
"October 15, 2016","Heard a lot, both positive and negative experiences but I am glad we went up anyway. We got the tickets online combined with Madams Tussauds for 78 £ for both of us. Eye is worth the money. Lines can be a bit long, but moving fast. Capsules are not crowded so you get a pretty good view. And the view is absolutely divine. You're up in the sky for half an hour, so you get a good perspective of beautiful London and how huge it really is.",OUTSTANDING!
"October 14, 2016","The 30 minute ""flight"" on the London Eye was incredible.  A wonderful, panoramic view of London and the Thames.  Well worth the time and effort get to this location.",I take all my visitors here!
"September 27, 2020","As a Londoner, I take anyone who visits on the London Eye.  I've been so many times now, but still don't tire of it.  Worth doing anything you can to pre-book and beat the queues however, because it can be a bit of a long wait....",Excellent as usual 
"September 27, 2020",This visit was excellent and the best as usual. I would like to give a huge thank you to Tilly one of the staff who made our visit even more fantastic. She gave me and our family a separate pod because it was my sisters birthday and she and all of us were very happy because of this. ,Amazing Service
"September 26, 2020",Had booked as a package deal but couldn’t book online for an extra experience at the time so we’re advised to go to customer service on the day to upgrade.Annoyingly that was not the case on arrival as fully booked ( gutted ) but the manager did arrange for a private pod at no extra cost!!! So kind and much appreciated and all the staff from start to finish were so so friendly especially  as we had a nervous passenger lol.The views were amazing and even though really high winds the pod felt safe. Only issue was the half and hour seemed like 5 minutes!!!!!!Can’t wait to return for a trip at a different time of day.Highly recommend and many thanks to all the staff - great experience- we loved it!!!!,Great experience 
"September 26, 2020",Loved going on the eye you could see so much of London! Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the beautiful city ,Good but a guide book or local info needed
"September 23, 2020","We loved this but I have to say not being from London, other than the obvious land marks like big Ben and the Palace I had no idea what else I was looking at.A little leaflet or place with info would be ideal to make the most of the experience.Other than that great 30/40 worth doing ",Nice wiew
"September 23, 2020",Very nice boat trip .well enjoyed.highly recomended.our boat guide very good .he's. Explained London history,Highly Recommend the Champagne Experience
"September 21, 2020","We had the pod to ourself with AJ was our host, the  experience was excellent  the champagne was chilled,, the afternoon was sunny and clear, and what a spectacular view of London, AJ was a charming host, polite and very informative, would highly recommend.",Amazing
"September 20, 2020","This is amazing,if you come to London,you must find time and go to famous London Eye and visit this place. All the best.",Bit warm 
"September 20, 2020",Some great views of London we had a hot hot day was starting to get uncomfortable in the pod with the heat I much say made us feel safe we had our own pod with sanitizer staff where helpful ,Brilliant views 🤩
"September 20, 2020","Visited London for the first time last week and we had planned to do the London eye. We had a voucher from a flyer which gets you discount when you show it along with your train ticket. So it was £31 for 2 people. There was no queue, We had our own pod and the views were unbelievable, as there wasn’t a cloud in the sky. The pod, thankfully was air conditioned as it was 28° outside ! The journey lasts about 25mins. If you’ve not done it, I would definitely recommend it, so you can see all of London! ",Overrated
"July 10, 2016",Ok you get a nice view but so you do from any one of the tall buildings sprouting up in London. You queue up for 45 minutes (having already reserved and paid) and get into a pod with about 50 (?) other people.Just a waste of money.You can a wonderful romantic view of London for free from the middle of Waterloo Bridge and no crowds.,Fab Experience. Read the Smallprint 
"July 10, 2016",A breathtaking experience with fantastic views of the great city of London. Only one  minor dissapointment. When booking I booked a skip the line ticket thinking that it was a fast track. It was skip the booking line and not the que for the Eye! We qued for around thirty minutes before getting into our pod. Worth the wait.,Expensive but a must do
"July 9, 2016",This was number 1 to do on my teens list for our visit to London. It was great and the views are really great. Not a cheap exercise but worth doing.,Over Rated
"July 8, 2016",Expensive and over rated! The attraction was very busy and queuing to pay and then queuing to enter was to much very disappointing.,Must See
"July 3, 2016",Brilliant tourist attraction.  I'd recommend to go around sunset when it's not too busy.  Book online aswel if you can.,30 Minute Panorama of London
"July 1, 2016","A relatively slow-moving wheel, the Eye provides excellent views of London from Big Ben, the Parliament buildings and down the Thames to St. Paul's Cathedral.  Stunning views.",Get in line early to purchase tickets.
"June 28, 2016","When in London this is the one thing you must do, great view of the city. When it's time to take your picture- be sure to be facing outward and place your feet just like how it is shown. Otherwise we'll be laughing becuase the phot is of your back!",London Eye catches the Eye 
"June 28, 2016","Just drove by via hop on hop off bus  (Big Bus), but it really literally caught my eye.Next time i am definitely going to visit.",Great attraction. 
"June 26, 2016","We visited the London Eye on our last day in London, it was a great way to close a great trip. The views are beautiful and the pictures snapped from every stop are priceless. A must do in London! ",First time in london
"June 19, 2016","We arrived on a Tuesday morning around 10:00am. We purchased our tickets at the booth nearby.  We did purchase regular tickets, not fast pass. We were surprised the area was not very crowded. Within an hour we had purchased our tickets, waited in line and were set to board.   Our party of five boarded with eight other people.  We really enjoyed the experience and the views from the wheel.  This was the one thing we did that everyone wanted to do again.",It's a ferris wheel
"July 22, 2016",Good views but the rotating nature of it means you won't get to spend much time enjoying the views. They also sell overpriced photos of you in the cabins - both a fake one and a real one that you pose for on the way down.Be smart and book your tickets online beforehand since its much cheaper and you can avoid one of two fairly long lines. ,Great views and pictures 
"July 22, 2016","Get up early and try to be there before 11 am, summer lines can be 2 hours or more. If you get there early no bed for fast access/fast pass. ",Third time on the eye - love it every time
"July 21, 2016",We visited on a hot July day using the Merlin Annual Pass - which was excellent as we were put straight in the fast track queue. Even though it was 31 degrees outside the pod was lovely and air conditioned.Fantastic views and a lovely smooth ride as always! My small son (4) was less interested in the landmarks but liked to look down at the nearby play ground and the water feature by the Royal Festival Hall that we had also visited that day so that kept him busy.Planning to go again and see London lit up at night in the future.,Incredible!!! 
"July 20, 2016",We came on the hottest day of the year and thankfully I'd pre purchased tickets for the champagne experience on the London Eye. We didn't have to wait outside queuing for ages in the scorching heat but instead picked our tickets up and were directed upstairs to the champagne bar where we bought a drink and waited for our host to collect us. When collected we were taken straight onto the London eye and given a glass of champagne! Lovely experience and so glad we upgraded as it meant we weren't melting outside!!!!  ,uninteresting
"July 20, 2016","long queqes, extremely slow moving, needs to be jazzed up to to make it interesting as a tourist attraction, as an engineer it was interesting, even my teenagers were unimpressed",Use your OWN EYES instead!
"July 20, 2016","The London Eye was recommended by a woman we met at one of our hotels so we decided to go. The lines and prices are so crazy, so we splurged and paid for the expedited line and £10 per person upgrade to bypass the line.The facility is pleasant enough and the air-conditioning was lovely.The weather was great so we could see far, but honestly there was nothing that we saw from above that warranted the tremendous cost (both money and time). Big Ben is gorgeous from the ground, so it's not necessary to see it from the air. Buckingham Palace looked like a grey library from above and wasn't impressive at all. When we walked to it and saw it on foot from the proper angle, it was lovely.In retrospect, we wish we hadn't done the Eye; it was a total waste of time and money.",Rained out
"July 19, 2016",Would have been a great experience if it had not been for the British weather gods to pour down on us. All we could see was the buildings and sites in close proximity. ,What a view
"July 17, 2016","We went on a champagne experience and had fast track through the massive queues, the view is truly fantastic, you don't know where to look first, was over too quickly.",Unexpected short wait
"July 16, 2016","Fabulous view, of course.  Take a very up-to-date map to work out all the newer buildings.We were recommended to visit around 6.30 for a shorter wait time and it worked perfectly.  There were just 3 of us, so we were moved forward in the queue to fill a space.  Total wait time was under 10 mins.  Be ready for the photo just before the finish.",A GREAT VIEW OF LONDON!
"July 11, 2016",YOU MUST come if you want to see the beautiful City London from the sky above. And it will be also GREAT if you can come at night which will be 10 times beautiful! And Big Ben under will also look great. And it's really a place that you MUST go.Good luck ,National Gallery 4.12.20
"December 7, 2020","This was my second visit this year(1st one in July).I love visiting but on ths occasion I was a little disappointed.Here are the reasons why;1)You have to arrive fifteen minutes before your time slot,on Friday 4th December it was very cold and raining,so you coat gets wet and then once inside there is no cloak room!not a great start!2)You cant have a break to get a drink/lunch,although some of the staff say you can!after two hours I wanted to have lunch,one staff member told me this was ok and said he would look out for me to let me back in.This didnt happen,another staff  member(more senior) tried to stop me and said I wasnt allowed to return to the gallery and treated me like a naughty school for attempting to do so!I know there are covid rules in place but this was ridiculous! Iwas allowed back in(i had to be escorted back in!) I spoke to a more helpful staff member who informed me that most people only stay in the gallery for 2 hours and that I am a rare breed who wants to take her time!She advised me to book 2 slots if I want to return in the future,Ithink I will wait until things are back to normal!and visit when I want without these awful restrictions.You even have to choose the route you want to take otherwise you can miss the art you actually came to see!They should tell you that when you arrive,the staff should be adequately trained to give out the right information!This is the longest review I have written!but feel people need to know what to expect!",Great collection of art and history
"January 3, 2021","You must visit the National Gallery. Having been abroad to other nations galleries and museums, you have to pay a fee to get in, not the case with British Museum's. The collection of the art and the history on the walls are a fantastic way of getting in touch of the bygone eras. The rooms, the staff and the layout are all helpful and brilliant.",A well curated visit
"August 4, 2020","Pre-booking a time slot was the way to my heart and this proved to be a fantastic way to see the incredible works of art. Three different routes around the gallery ensured that you didn’t miss anything (unless you wanted to!). Face coverings were required, but some people seemed to have rejected them by the time it got to the Impressionists. However, it was great to be able to feel safe - and there still weren’t too many people. ",Such a great place!
"February 16, 2020","On a seriously wet and windy Sunday, there's no better place to go, although a lot of people had the same idea. It's a warren of rooms with  amazing art to lose yourself in from Rubens to Titian to Constable to Seurat. My favourite room, always crowded, is the one with all the impressionist art. The cafe has excellent service and wonderful food at a reasonable price. Too much to take it all in one visit but a place to return to many times. It's actually, a great place to visit, no matter the weather.",Afternoon visit
"March 19, 2020",I was here on last Sunday. It was a wonderful experience I saw many beautiful paintings. There was a huge variety of artists and the Gallery is huge. Spent a few hours here to try to appreciate and see everything I highly recommend going here ,A Stunning Collection of Paintings
"December 15, 2022","The National Gallery in London is one of the best museums in Britain. Home to famous paintings such as the Hay Wain by John Constable, The Fighting Temeraire by J. M. W. Turner, Virgin of the Rocks by Leonardo da Vinci and Vase with Fifteen Sunflower by Vincent van Gogh amongst many more. The Gallery is also marvellously decorative with every room looking really stunning and rich. I spent 2 hours looking around, but I recommend you can spend 3-4 hours looking around taking a more of a detailed look.   There are over 2000 paintings in the National Gallery plus some temporary displays which can sometimes have an entrance fee. While I was there they had a Turner temporary display in which you can view paintings such as Cologne, the Arrival of a Packet-Boat: Evening and Harbour of Dieppe: Changement de Domicile. Overall its a wonderful experience visiting the National Gallery.",Raphael Exhibition rip off
"July 15, 2022","I have been visiting lots of galleries and museums with my son this week and included a visit to the Raphael exhibition at the NG. However, I was horrified to be charged £5 each to scan a QR code so we could hear a guided tour on OUR phones, using OUR headphones. The exhibition cost a whacking £25 each and then £10 on top of this was a total of £60 for us both. We were not charged to scan a QR code for a guide at any other museum or gallery. I find this to be greedy and poor judgement on the part of a reputable gallery.This is no way to entice a post pandemic audience in who are feeling the pinch with the added issue of the cost of living going up. I wouldn't say the guide was worth it either. Disappointing is an understatement.",Great art / hard to navigate
"January 4, 2020",Undoubtably contains a trove of great art.  With all large museums though it can be a little overwhelming especially if you are familiar with the history or the range of artists.  I would suggest planning your visit before you come so you dont get overwhelmed.,Titian exhibition
"October 8, 2020","We were pleased to be able to see some art after many months without a visit to a gallery.  The Titian exhibition was very good and was well organised from the Covid perspective at the arrival point, although inside not all visitors are quite so good at maintaining social distance as you might hope.  The instructions are clear though and fortunately with limited numbers it is fairly easy to find space to avoid those individuals.","We like everything of it, also the cafeteria."
"March 21, 2021","It is one of the places that I could always visit, all year round, every day, in the snow, in the rain, even if, to tell the truth, I know almost all of its works, apart from those of the special, temporary exhibitions.The National Gallery is full of great Italian and foreign artists.We have admired Raphael, Tintoretto, Titian, Vasari, Mantegna but also Van Gogh and Gaugain.Not to mention the many English artists.One remains breathless for hours in front of so much beauty.Admission is free, the museum deserves more than one visit.We like also its cafeteria!Highly recommended.",World class art gallery that is free and accessible to the public
"August 20, 2023","Incredible art gallery that I love and have returned to about once per year for about 10 years (almost every time I am in London from the US).Special shout-out to Alan who works there and made my entire day during a recent visit. Alan is passionate and knowledgeable about art. I was concerned because I could not find my favorite Claude painting (Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba) and Alan not only immediately knew what painting I was describing, but knew where they moved it. He also knew key facts about the work, artist, and reason for where it was moved too. Thank you Alan and National Gallery for another memorable trip - See you soon!",Really forces you to get your steps in
"August 20, 2023","I mean if you love history this is a must. From the egyptians to assyrians to greeks, romans, chinese, persians, etc etc. Every single civilization you learned about in primary school they have so much about!  ",Wonderful Museum
"August 18, 2023","Our visit today was the second time we visited here. The first time was in 2015 and a few of the rooms were closed (I think the security staff may have been on strike). As such, I missed seeing two of the paintings I’d hoped to see: Hans Holbein’s “The Ambassadors” and Van Eyck’s “Arnolfini Wedding.” I said then, “next time I’m in London.” That next time was today and I got to see both.This is a great collection here. To just walk in and look at the regular collections, it is free. There are a ton of well known masterpieces.My favorite, though? Camille Pissarro, “Late Afternoon in our Meadow.” That painting appealed to me deeply.Right outside is Trafalgar Square to enjoy. You are also a short (maybe 15 minute walk) from Buckingham Palace and even closer to Parliament.",NATIONAL GALLERY
"August 18, 2023","The national gallery has priceless masterpieces. Famous painters like Pablo Picasso, Van Gogh and many more have their works on display here. It is located in Trafalgar Square and can have a queue of up to 2 hours. Prior booking is recommended. Guarantee 2 hours to be able to see everything and the gift shop too.",You must stop in if even for an hour!
"August 18, 2023","We came here yesterday with a friend. We stop here for a visit every year while in London. It is free and has wonderful art from many great masters. Easy to walk around and soak in as much as you want! Van Gogh, Monet, Rembrandt, Pissarro and so many more. This is a must see in London!",Wonderful
"August 17, 2023","Quite expensive if you're taking a family to the paid exhibition but we really enjoyed it. This is obviously a very beautiful place, the kids loved it and we plan to visit regularly. ",Nice museum
"August 15, 2023","Nice art, nice museum, and completely free. Nearly every work has concise and informative explanatory text. It was pretty crowded, though, and the layout is a little confusing.",Nice Collection 
"August 14, 2023","Visited on a Monday afternoon with a group of 4 - had no tickets or advanced reservations. Waited in line for about 10 minutes and entered (free entrance). Spent about 80-90 minutes exploring gorgeous art and work from famous artists. Did not get to see the entire gallery as we had to leave, but could've easily spent more time admiring. Restrooms, food, and gift shop on site.",Exhilarating experience
"August 14, 2023","Brilliant ""Impressionism:Inventing Modern"" exhibition.  The paintings are beautifully hung for maximum effect and, although the galleries were crowded, we had more than sufficient time to view each of them and to make notes. We described the exhibition to each other as being exhilarating. We finished the visit with a coffee and talked over what we had seen.  Our only disappointment was the female toilet facilities which left much to be desired. ",Memorable visit
"August 11, 2023",A great couple of hours going up the National Gallery The museum has a good collection of paintings . The museum also has a beautiful interior with larger spaces for its exhibits.,Outstanding
"January 1, 2020","After having visited London several times over the last 25 years i finally manged to visit the National Gallery. What a treasure and and unbelievably free. Great layout, easy to navigate and if you know what you want to see you can access those rooms with ease. Yes there's a scrum at Sunflowers but be patient and you will be rewarded. Brilliant selection of the impressionists and Italian masters. An absolute must for art lovers",World class art collection with a programme of art exhibitions
"April 24, 2020","We are indeed fortunate in London to have the National Gallery with its world-class art collections and programme of international exhibitions, which have moved on-line in the current environment. On of the joys, not to be missed, are the smaller exhibitions, often of more contemporary or modern work, complementing the main collections.  Earlier in the year, one such exhibition was of paintings and studies by the young David Bomberg alongside paintings he admired and was inspired by in the National Gallery.One was so controversial in its day – a study of Canadian tunnellers as a First World War memorial – that is was rejected as an ‘abortion’ by the Canadians’ art advisor.  You can understand why – it must have been challenging at the time; today we can admire the energy, power and darkness that Bomberg created in the work.Not only a link into the collections of the National Gallery itself, but also to other galleries in London which display Bomberg's work.",Stunning
"March 29, 2021",This is definitely one of the best thing you can do in London. The fact that it is free just makes of even better. We went there twice on two different days in the late afternoon after we've already visited other monuments. I just can't believe the art collection they have there. The old part of the museum where the modern paintings stand is very well organised. The new part with the old paintings from the 1200/1300s is not as well organised but you can still enjoy the artworks. ,"A top 5  ""must visit"" location in London."
"June 9, 2020","There's something for everyone here and because entry is essentially free (donations gratefully accepted) , one can spend a short time viewing selective paintings of interest within an hour. We aimed for  Sunflowers by Van Gogh and Ballet dancers by Degas. A very enjoyable experience. ",Stunning Art collection
"February 25, 2020","National Gallery is one of my regulars galleries to visit in London. It is massively big with stunning art collection. the location is also convince in central London near Waterloo, Leicester Square and Piccadilly circus. I like Impressionist and Post Impressionist rooms and often rest at the cafeteria after a couple of hours visit.",Brilliant as always
"September 27, 2022","If I am in London, I am at the National Gallery no matter what, so it was my fifth visit. This time I had only 90 minutes to spend because I had a timed ticket to the newly renovated Courtauld Gallery. As always, I headed to Leonardo Da Vinci’s “The Virgin of the Rocks”, the painting I adore along with its other version in The Louvre. Then it was divine Botticelli’s “Venus and Mars”, which had a whole new meaning for me because just before my trip I had finished reading “The House of Medici” by Christopher Hibbert. Continued with the Sainsbury Wing admiring masterpieces of Van Eyck, Michelangelo, Andrea del Sarto, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Hans Holbein, Durër… all of them wonderful…I also had some time left for the two paintings comparison exhibit: Picasso’s vs. Ingres’s (Madame Moitessier). In all honesty, I didn’t find any similarities, except for the pose of the two women, but it is not too important - both paintings are beautiful. Do not get discouraged by the long line to enter the National Gallery - it moves very fast and you will pass security check in no time.",Big building full of paintings
"March 3, 2022","It is what it is.  It’s free to enter (which is a bonus) and, if one can avoid the school parties, a relaxing and interesting couple of hours low-key entertainment.For the art-uneducated visitor I found it quite it interesting to stumble across famous works and to be surprised by their size and details which are missed in printed depictions.The gift shop was surprisingly well priced (possibly catering for the aforementioned school trip purchases).All in all there are worse places to kill time on a rainy day in central London.",Great museum
"October 27, 2023","We reserved these tickets online during our layover, and they were Free, requiring only advance booking. Exploring the plethora of exquisite paintings and artworks was a delightful experience. Although art isn't my particular passion, I found it enjoyable. The gallery is conveniently situated in the downtown area, near Westminster station and other notable landmarks. If you happen to be in London without any prior engagements, I highly recommend visiting this cultural gem.",Great works of art
"June 26, 2020",Definitely a must see if you're visiting London. So many great works of art are located here and all are available for a donation. Allow yourself a minimum of 3 hours to go through the museum to really enjoy what it offers. You will see amazing works of art from the masters.   ,Great place to visit - inspiring exhibitions
"January 9, 2020","I always love popping into the National Gallery or National Portrait Gallery next door, when I'm in the area. They are big enough to handle the crowds of tourists so that you won't really feel them. The exhibitions are extraordinarily well-curated and worth checking out. ",Exhibits Five Star
"December 29, 2021","The art is exceptional: no doubt about it. The layout is genius and the building is stunning.The gallery is let down by organisation. You have to get your free ticket before entering. This entailed everyone standing around a QR code on the wall, completing a long form and waiting for their ticket to arrive by email.Then you queue again to enter. Someone waves a torch inside some of your bags and finally you are allowed to enter the gallery.",Enjoyable afternoon
"March 1, 2020","Spent a very enjoyable afternoon, looking at the impressionist art and gift shop at the national gallery. It’s free to visit and we’ll organised. They ask for a voluntary donation, we’ll worth a Visit if you enjoy art.",Breathtaking exhibition of paintings by Artemisia Gentileschi
"December 14, 2020","An astonishing achievement to bring so many paintings by Artemisia Gentileschi together at one time, including some from private collections and others from across the world.  Amongst those I have not come across before was her 1636-7 “Bathsheba bathing“, with David almost invisible away in the background a virtually amorphous dark lump on a balcony: all the colour; all the personality in Bathsheba and her maid servants, and the relationships between them.  The staff were universally welcoming and friendly: not easy with the various requirements to wear face-nappies &cetera: these requirements are not of their making, and even though pointless they have to be enforced.  A fabulous visit.  ",Great in theory
"January 12, 2020","I know this will go against the grain. The National Gallery is free, it is a beautiful building, it is full of famous and less famous paintings of the highest quality from across the centuries. If you are an art historian or budding art historian it must be one of the greatest resources in the world. Sadly I have my fill of messiahs, wistful saints and impenetrable allegory pretty quickly (there's one that's captioned ""this might be an allegory on the pain of love or it may be a picture of a girl"", if they don't know...).There is little here I would have on my wall at home and they are the paintings I can gaze at and enjoy. So from a purely selfish, subjective viewpoint there are galleries that appeal to me far more than this one, hence the rating.Go, enjoy but don't expect to enjoy every room. On top of everything else they do well the dining room is good too.",The gateway to Westminster!
"February 12, 2020","Trafalgar Square is very impressive - it was only 10min from Leicester Square, Covent Garden, Big Ben and Buckingham Palace! There is also the sublime National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery and there are always shows or activities for every occasion including Chinese New Year, Christmas, Hanukkah and even demonstrations where people cry their hearts out on stage below Nelson’s statue.Finally Trafalgar Square is what it’s name says - I personally love that the statue of Nelson is face to face with that of Napoleon in Paris. An old rivalry so close to British politics and heart. And, if I’m not mistaken it is just a few minutes walk away from the famous Savoy hotel! Who’s name comes from the Palais de Savoie which previously stood in its place and was The designated place for French foreign royal emissaries to stay when they came to visit the British Crown before the revolution of 1789. Perfectly located between Westminster and The City.A great visit and must see for any person who wishes to have a feel for what London is about.",For the love of Art.
"March 5, 2020","A rich learning experience. Breathtaking. Art through the ages. Paintings by Old Masters. I particularly visit 'The National Gallery' to see Impressionist and Post Expressionist artists like Degas, Monet, Modigliani and Cezanne and Chagall. I particularly like portraits. I enjoy pottierng in 'The Gallery Shop' and stopping for a spot of cafe lunch or a cup of reviving afternoon tea at 'The Cafe'. A great place to spend a rainy afternoon.",Great for the 1st date
"February 11, 2020","A little bit of culture goes a long way, that's why many a good relationship as started from treading the galleries at the Nat....beautifully designed halls welcome and encourage you to explore its interior. Straight away from outside you are greeted by the smile of the Roman columns across the gallery facaded....but once inside the world of Art is there to show off it's very best from throughout the ages and across the globe. I for one believe it's a natural place for a 1st date, and set within one of the worlds most romantic cities.",lovely gallery
"February 10, 2020","I always like coming to the national gallery it is very clean, the people who work there are helpful and the things in the gift shop are usually quite nice. it might be nice if they had more of a variety of mini-prints in the gift shop, but mostly can appreciate the paintings in real life when you are there. The cafe has good service also and isn't as overpriced as some of the other museum cafes in London.",Jetlagged but awakened by masterpieces
"February 24, 2020","We got into our London lodgings and then took a bus after dinner to see some sights.  We got off right in front of the National Gallery -- and it was open!  I was revitalized by this art, many pieces I remembered from my ""History of Art"" class in college.  Well worth visiting. I used to go to the Smithsonian and Phillips Galleries a lot when I lived in DC. So I'm used to great art but this place is spectacular.","I know what I hate, and I don't hate this."
"March 15, 2020","We had an hour to kill before our train home, so we dropped in here on our way to the station. Entry is free, though they do ask for donations. We went to the rooms that feature mostly 19th century artists, such as Turner, Monet, Cezanne and Van Gogh - some of our favourites. The gallery is laid out in a way that's very easy to navigate and find what you are looking for, and the rooms are presented in a very logical way. Take care to look up while you walk around as the building itself is beautiful and well worth a second look.Visit. You are certain to find something to please you.",Covid secure & well planned
"September 3, 2020","I enjoyed an afternoon visiting 'old friend's (paintings) at the National Gallery. Easy to book, well organised and once inside you had enough freedom to wander where you wanted to - just like prior to Lockdown. Of particular interest was the refurbished and newly opened Rausing Gallery - magnificently restored and hung.","Use the loos by the exit, the main entrance toilets don't get cleaned"
"July 25, 2021","I am putting this on here as a warning and piece of advice.Whilst this is a great gallery to visit. I have noticed that if you get cut short, use the loos by the exit/espresso shop. As they seem to be cleaned on a regular basis and are not a mess. I found the toilets by the entrance in a mess and the gents cubicle loos  always blocked and toilet roll everywhere. It's a shame that whilst they keep the rest of the building tidy, they want you to start off with a awful experience, and when you notify staff you just get shouted at saying 'we are busy today.' Awful customer service when I was kindly notifying them and not complaining. Well that's no excuse when you're one of the busiest attractions in London and I am complaining now, if you didn't want to listen to me the first time.Sort your cleaning schedule out, especially with covid around!!!",Fabulous art gallery
"July 16, 2022",Great place to visit and free. I was slightly miffed that I booked tickets online and whilst they were free it was completely unnecessary; you just queue up at the door. The art work is varied and beautifully displayed. It’s easy to access and you can walk through and focus on your particular interest. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable. Gift shops are wonderful and have so many exciting things.,NATIONAL GALLERY
"August 18, 2023","The national gallery has priceless masterpieces. Famous painters like Pablo Picasso, Van Gogh and many more have their works on display here. It is located in Trafalgar Square and can have a queue of up to 2 hours. Prior booking is recommended. Guarantee 2 hours to be able to see everything and the gift shop too.","Large, well presented art collection"
"March 9, 2020","Right in Trafalgar Square, this large art museum has an extensive collection with free admission (donations welcome).  We focused on the impressionist rooms and enjoyed the informational signage on each picture.  We spent a couple of hours, but one could spendf much longer.We saw, and spent time 2 very nice gift shops, and there is also a cafe and restaurant on the premises although there are many, many restaurants in the immediate area.",A Must
"January 14, 2020","A treasure, a joy. Where else can you walk in on a whim and see a stunning collection of paintings by great artists- without paying a cent. In addition, every special exhibition (for which you do have to pay, of course) has been part of my art education. But the permanent collection! Well, the paintings in the galleries have become old friends. We savour them on every visit. The commentary on audio guides is, of course, something you must hear. We love this gallery, so much more manageable and inviting than the unique universe of The Louvre, paradisal as it is. This institution is one reason to stay happy about the world, life, culture. I mean, every visit to London we go. Without fail.",print your tickets warning
"October 12, 2020","Just a word of warning rather than a full review, please make sure you print off your conformation tickets before you arrive. The staff have to scan the QR barcode thingy and I, as well as several others could not get tickets to download on our phones whilst waiting outside (and yes all brands, not just Samsung/iphones etc). The staff where helpful if a little harassed at all the people having the same trouble. Also, it's a good idea to arrive a good 15 mins before your allotted time. If you can't print off the tickets before arriving, like me,  then arrive a good 30 mins before your allotted time.",A young person's perspective of the gallery
"May 17, 2022","As a young person visiting the gallery, I was initially worried about whether it was for me, due to the stigma surrounding art galleries. However, I ended up being pleasantly surprised by just how captivating the art being showcased all over the gallery was to me. I would definately recommend to people of all ages, not just adults as it is far better than what usual art galleries are presented as.",No surprise-great collection!
"February 23, 2020","A great museum with something for every art lover.  If you like Impressionism, the Gallery has a great selection; if you like other periods, they’re equally well represented.  A don’t miss:  The Execution of Lady Jane Gray by Paul Delarouche — superb!",Plenty of information and staff on hand to help
"January 5, 2020",The exhibits here are a hood mix of modern and old. There is a member of staff in every room who can answer questions about the paintings. Each painting has information about it on the wall. The only issue we had was that it is like a rabbit warren and naps on the venue were difficult to find. ,Fantastic 
"February 24, 2020","This is such a beautiful space. The works are wonderful - as you tend to get with national collections - but the gallery is just put together in such a gorgeous way. I always love visiting.£5 for the audio tour Photography is allowed but as usual, no flashes or tripods.","So tiring but, amazing to walk around and free"
"July 6, 2021","So many amazing works of art everywhere, To visit is free though, booking a time lot during the pandemic was essential.Staff very helpful although a word of caution, do not upset them!During our visit two visitors decided the one way system didn't apply to them, it was made abundantly clear it most certainly did.There are three routes to choose from though you can do them all of course. Each takes around half hour or so depending on a lot of factors like time spent in awe or just struggling to walk.Plenty of seating although it is perhaps a little too low for many so not so easy to get up again if in pain.Clearly divided into sections which make sense and easy to skip any areas not of interest or, at quieter times, dwell on those which are of interest.Lifts are easy to get to and great for those in a wheel chair. I am disabled and left my stick at the hotel which I rapidly regretted! It really is a lot of walking and, like an idiot, I used the stairs to try and be 'normal'. Will I ever learn?",AMAZING!!
"June 13, 2020","We are  so lucky that we can go to London and enter such places like the National Gallery for free.  You don't have to be a ""luvvie"" to enjoy this experience - there is something here for everyone.  In truth it is overwhelming when you see what the National Gallery has to offer.  It breathes history - the location, the building and the collections inside.  As I get older I appreciate more and more what has gone before me. Take time out to visit the National Gallery (more than once).",Lots of art
"October 20, 2020","I fully appreciate that I may be an art philistine but wanting to drink from the cup of culture and expand my horizons I booked a tour through the National Gallery. All it did was cement my earlier opinion, (forged at the pretentious Tate Modern) that art is akin the “The Emperors New Clothes “ (You may not get that reference if you are under 50.) Insecure fools feel the need to rave about art to give themselves a feeling of superiority and a personality.Now, contradicting myself I can appreciate the immense skill of some of these artists in producing technically impressive paintings so long ago. However too many had no idea of perspective,  see a pretentious arty term, and produced work that could have been produced by a 5 year old. Oh my God, Van Gogh’s Chair.... really?If art’s you’re thing, go, but take a long hard look at yourself and see if you can’t get a life.",Don't bring a large umbrella if you don't have £2!
"December 28, 2022",I respect the fact that large umbrellas should go into the cloakroom in order to avoid hitting the paintings with it. But you can't demand that I put it in there and charge me £2 to do so.I understand why you charge £2 to leave something superficial like shopping which one could simply just carry around with them but you can't charge for an item that you demand someone to leave.In the past you didn't charge for large umbrellas.I work in a museum which requires its visitors to leave large umbrellas in the cloakroom but we wouldn't have the audacity to charge them for it.Also is there some reason why you don't care about your own collection getting hit by an umbrella? It would have appeared I could have walked around with it had I not visited the exhibition.,One of the top art galleries in the World
"August 23, 2020","If you love art, then this must be your 1st stop.Having been to the Louve in Paris, the Uffittsi in Florence and the Googlehiem in LA, all havens of visual art, the National Gallery is the show piece of them all.Don't just use it to get out of the rain, take time to view some of the best paintings in the World by every World master.The NA is a visit to blow your visual senses and a chance to learn as much from whats IN the paintings as it is a joy to see Works of ArtOn the hot day we went it was almost deserted and absent with Covid 19 tourists. Go now whilst there's a new ambience of studying ....... ",Wowwww
"December 13, 2022","I arrived early (before opening at 10am) and booked my tickets on the spot so that I could join the pre-booked tickets queue which was much shorter. I’m amazed that the admission to the Gallery is free given the expansiveness of the art available on exhibition. I thought that my children (6,3 and 1 years) wouldn’t enjoy the Gallery but I was wrong. They were equally impressed by the artworks and I could see them getting immersed by the experience.",Colour and Light Activity - Home Ed Trip
"February 21, 2022","The Home Educated children enjoyed their session with Edward . The children took part in a session called Colour and Light, all the children got to walk around the gallery with to look a certain paintings to enable them all have a discussion regarding the paintwork, strokes, meaning etc. After this the children had lunch and then went on to do a hands on creative painting activity. The children go to create their own Masterpiece to which they could take home, some were not dry so we the Gallery posted them to me once they were dry. The children enjoyed there day. The teacher was great, he welcomed the children, encouraged them to take part in the discussions and had great patience, especially with our SEN children.We have had him many years ago and highly recommend this gentleman, the Gallery should be very happy to have him working with them, Unfortunately, they do not offer certificates of attendance and if you create your own and send them it to get the confirmation they are not very certificate welcoming to the idea. This is a pity, as they did not need to do anything  regarding the certificate as it was made by the organiser as a majority of children do like a certificate to remember.They offer certain Art activities during certain times of the year.Lovely Gallery, can be hard to find bearings if you are a newbie.",My favorite: Van Gogh’s Sunflowers
"May 19, 2022","We spent several hours here and only scratched the surface. There are over 2,000 paintings spanning between the 13th century and 19th century. To see them all would take multiple days. Even though the museum is in Trafalgar Square (one of London’s business areas) tunnels from the metro lead to an entrance without ever having to go into the square. It is open 361 days a year and, since it is free, there is generally a crowd. We were there on a Saturday, and it was very busy, but it is large enough that it doesn’t seem packed. Since you can’t see everything, it is a good idea to make a list of the paintings you want to see beforehand. Even if you're not a big art person, the interior architecture of the building is beautiful and worth seeing. (PaM)",Lucian Freud exhibition
"December 13, 2022","The Lucian Freud exhibition is fairly small but showcases some startling works by the artist.It also illustrates how radically his style and focus evolved.While the National Gallery does not charge admissions, this exhibition does and the price is excessive.","Just amazing, must see artwork in the most beautiful setting"
"January 16, 2023","There's a pleasant surprise around every corner at this amazing gallery. I went to see the Lucian Freud, the Turner and the Manet & Eva Gonzales exhibitions all of which were truly brilliant. There's just so much to see that you could spend weeks in there and still not tire of seeing what's available. Lots of instantly recognisable artworks as well those less well known but equally as breath-taking. I turned a corner and found Van Gogh's Sunflowers which was wonderful to see. I ended up buying myself membership and their guide to everything that's on view throughout the galleries so I can make a plan to visit different areas in smaller visits. Can't wait to go back for another visit!",Vast exhibits continue to Improve
"December 16, 2022","We returned to the National Gallery in October and were impressed by the  improvements they continue to make to both the facilities and exhibits.It is also free to visit which is remarkable in pricey London. The only disappointment was their new, upscale restaurant which we found to be cramped and the food quite ordinary. Their adjacent simple restaurant is a better value in our opinion.",Free and wonderful italian masterpieces
"September 1, 2022",Still free. Along the years I noted in several museums (slightly everywhere) different rates for locals and tourists. This incredibile museum is still free - even after the recent past years have had great changes.Always impressed by the amount of italian masterpieces.,Nipping in to the National Gallery.
"January 1, 2020","I was in London attending a funeral and after the reception I past through the National Gallery and thought I would go in. It takes your breath away, so many wonderful paintings! The restaurants are good, the best one being on the ground floor at the Charring Cross Road end of the building. It’s best to book a table if you can, but the self service area is very good, but usually busy. I like the shops in the gallery. My favourite paintings are the Cezanne still life’s, but there is so much to see.",Amazing Exhibits
"February 10, 2020","The National Gallery houses a huge selection of paintings from around the world. There's something for everyone here, no matter how fleeting your interest in art may be. The gallery also has an excellent gift shop with some brilliant things to buy from postcards & notepads to books and t shirts.","Vibrant, delightful, and decorated"
"August 15, 2021","The National Gallery is a beautiful site: not only does it house some delicate and delightful paintings from across the Globe, but it also is a beautiful building in itself. The decor is pleasing and serene, and sets a contemplative ambiance.We visited recently in COVID-19 times. You queue up outside, and very friendly staff guide you to enter and be scanned. Routine bag checks are still conducted. You are advised to book in advance.You climb the stairs, and get to select a route to walk. We only had an hour due to an engagement afterwards, so we took a shorter tour. Rooms have an expert sat in there, awaiting any questions you might have. Paintings have information about them. There are many new additions on loan, so now is a good time to go and explore.The paintings themselves are varied: there are many portraits, landscapes, and different styles of art: from Impressionism to Modernism. I don’t really know a lot about art, but I liked the variety and vibrancy of the pieces.I would definitely come again.",A wonderful visit
"June 27, 2021",The National Gallery offers a huge variety of art with many famous original paintings. Entrance is free though you are able to make a voluntary donation. Pre-booking is essential due to Covid 19 . We loved it.,Premium London Museum
"April 29, 2020","If you're in the region of Piccadilly Circus, the National Gallery is worth a visit. This is quite an extensive museum with loads of exhibits for every taste. You'll view pieces like Sunflowers (Van Gogh), Venus and Mars (Botticelli), and Water Lillies (Monet). Even someone who isn't all that into classic art will see some exciting and recognizable pieces. You could spend all day here!",Stunning collection
"December 19, 2021","It was a wonderful experience to visit the National Gallery and view the amazing collection of paintings. So much to see, it would take a few visits to absorb it all properly. However, we saw all the paintings on our shortlist, apart from Constable's, The Hay Wain which is currently not on display. The admission is free but donations are welcome, there are also some nice shops within the building.",Facsinating
"April 15, 2020",This museum contains one of the largest art collections in the world next to the big museums all over the world. Its Europeanian collections and mainly the English are huge and fascinating. Its entrance is free so you can come again and again....,A great free museum
"August 26, 2020",The National Gallery is a great museum with free entry and is a good day out alone or in a group. It has many different wings with thousands of paintings including famous pieces such as the Sunflowers by Van Gogh. Definitely more for renaissance fans though as there is not much modern art.,We are very lucky to have this collection available for us all to enjoy
"August 6, 2021","The Rembrandts are the best, although I do also enjoy some of the Impressionist paintings. Unfortunately, I am not able to visit very often, and on the very day that I visited, one of my favourite paintings had been taken down that morning. (the Vigée Le Brun self portrait)  However, one of the gallery staff directed me to another of her paintings which I hadn't seen before and also to a Gentileschi which he thought I might like, so I would like to thank him for his thoughtfulness and assistance.",Great and Free!
"February 20, 2020","We went early - 10am at opening time and walked straight in. Make sure you go round in room number order, or you could miss half the gallery out.  I went for the Turners and Van Goghs.  So great stand inches away and imagine the brush strokes being applied!  A great cheap way to spend half a day.",Great for a mooch in art environment
"January 30, 2020","This is a great free venue in the heart of London, metres away from the Tube and opening onto Trafalgar Square. It has a very impressive range of artworks and sculptures from all ages. Free entry and a great restaurant. Not cheap but you can sit there for hours and chat to friends,",So Great that one of THE great art galleries in the World is open again..
"May 31, 2021","It wasn't until we were actually inside that we both realised how happy we were. You sometimes dont know how great something is until you cant have it. Please ignore the bad reviews. It's really simple to book on line, then you wait until your time and you are in about 2 minutes. There are three pre set routes and you you can do them all if you want. It's was fun for us to do just one and look at paintings we hadn't noticed before. The cafe and shop are still open and neither are too crowded. And at the end look out for the six candidates for the Trafalgar Square plinth. Make sure you read the blurb as each is fascinating in their own way.Are you a Tourist..absolutely 100% visit here. It's even free! Thank you to the staff BTW. Very helpful and happy.Our tip for first timers? Dont try and see everything. And look at the architecture too",Loved the Raphael Exhibit
"August 12, 2022","In July the museum was overcrowded, many were not wearing masks, groups of students were there adding to the chaos, and it felt a bit overwhelming after pandemic lockdown mentality. That said, the Raphael Exhibition was a once in a lifetime event and I am thankful to have been able to see it. Employees and volunteers were helpful and well informed. It was a bit of a maze to find everything and having seen it all I was feeling as if I had been overloaded with beauty and so saturated I needed time to process it.",Great museum but too few post 1800 works
"November 6, 2021","Very nice museum. But, too much of the exhibited Art is medieval. There’s only so many portraits or religious icons that you can see before losing interest. That said, there are a number of pieces that made our day by Van Gogh, Monet, Gainsborough, Renoir. Just too few comparatively. Signage is not particularly helpful in getting you to the periods that interest you. Lots and lots of unmasked people. You’d think art lovers would be more considerate of others. Since we visited on a Thursday, it wasn’t crowded so we kept our distance.",Three well-designed routes
"October 23, 2020","Of course, you have to book in advance, but that's no problem, as long as your phone shows the booking!.  Be on the safe side - print out the ticket.  The Gallery has managed to lay out quite a few of its holdings in three separate walks, so you can see the periods of art you are particularly interested in.",European Paintings over the centuries at the National Gallery.
"August 21, 2020","This place is a huge sprawling space. Trafalgar Square is always teeming with tourists. So it is really crowded. I happened to be there on a day when the population was scarce. One just gets an idea of how big the place is in the center of the London. There were street artists performing there . A bagpiper was there playing a melancholy tune. The National gallery inside is large with a lot of paintings. And I think one day is not enough to see everything. There is no entry fee. There are small eateries inside. So one can relax and take a break from continuously gazing at the canvases. Th know a little more , read London-Life around the Thames at Papumashi the Nomad.",One of bucket list
"July 28, 2023","Waited 45 mins in a queue  to get in entry free, but paper maps £2 download map  done. Special Exhibition charged if you've booked you go through quick queue.   There  are  all sorts of ways to view the painting, audio, (reception)tour, and self guided. Shops on all floor no eating or drinking in the gallery but only 3 places to go to eat and drink  down stairs and then only if you buy their food and drink. (Expensive)  saw everything  I wanted to see. Went back to base.",Excellent Freud exhibition apart from nude paintings of his daughters which made for uncomfortable viewing.
"January 14, 2023",We came to visit the Lucien Freud exhibition which was quite expensive at £24 each. There was a lot to see and it was fascinating. There are a couple of paintings he did of his young daughters naked which made me uncomfortable and I am not sure these should have been shown.,FAMOUS ART
"January 13, 2023",I could spend a whole day in here but due to limited time I only saw maybe 75% of the gallery.  I printed out a map prior to arriving and circled the rooms of which pieces I HAD to see. My favorite was Van Gogh. Be prepared to wait since that's where it's mostly crowded. ,Great
"January 13, 2023","One of the World's great collections, it never ceases to impress. The breadth and depth of the art on display is fabulous.",My visit
"January 11, 2023","Sometime, during the year, I'd read the National Gallery would be having a Lucien Freud exhibiton of all of his paintings and drawings.  Everyone, who could go there during an evening, would be able to pay how much they could afford.  I was one of them.  But, I arrived half an hour too early but the person checking the tickets didn't mind.  I could take as much time as I liked to look round.  There were seats in the rooms for me to sit down.  There was a small shop, which sold the accompanying guide book, but I thought it was very expensive.  Afterwards, I was allowed to walk round the gallery seeing their paintings.  But, I couldn't stay long as the bus to the hotel didn't run all night.  So, I went back to Charing Cross underground station.",Incredible Experience
"January 9, 2023",I really can't describe how this Gallery is so important  to our heritage.Amazing paintings but to many to name.,Wonderful gallery
"January 9, 2023",Such a privilege to be able to see so many beautiful pieces. The galleries are large and the whole place is so relaxing to wander around.,Lovely guided tours
"January 9, 2023","Definitely worth visiting when in London, highly recommend the guided tours offered by the staff. In one hour you learn more than by visiting solo a whole day.",Great pieces
"January 8, 2023",The pieces were amazing and the building is outstanding- very beautiful.  Not sure why you need advance tickets online.  Museum is free.,Interesting gallery with loads of excellent pictures
"January 7, 2023",This is a must see attraction in London. There are so many pictures you feel like your inside them. This is a great place for kids and adults with different sections. If you are into art definitely come here,Amazing museum
"January 6, 2023",It is an art museum that does not end in sightseeing and leaves every room in awe once again. Art museum that houses a beautiful painting by Paul Gauguin called a vase of flowers,You need Time
"February 3, 2020",Plan one of two galleries before or after lunch in the Gallery restaurant.  There is so much to see.  You can always go next door to the National Portrait Gallery if you still ahve time.We did see a bunch of tourist walking through the gallery videoing everything on their mobile phones!!  No comment!,Still amazing
"August 1, 2023","I used to work near here so would often head in on the way to Charing Cross station. 15+ years later I went with my 8 year old daughter who's far more artistic than I'll ever be, and she loved it. It's still a wonderful place - not only the collections, but the building itself. The only thing that has changed is you can book advanced tickets (for free) to avoid the queue. Didn't know this until I got there but we were lucky, however this is worth knowing during school holidays and because one of wings is being renovated. There are few places on Earth that have so much beauty.",PRE BOOKED TICKET SHAMBLES
"December 11, 2022","I had booked tickets for entry to the National Gallery on Saturday 10th December but was told by a member of staff that I must queue like everyone else, it was over 1 hrs wait. I was actually standing next to the sign that said  Pre-Booked tickets and I showed him our tickets but he would not budge or call his Supervisor. Another family group were having the same problem and they were very annoyed, so in the end we all just walked passed him. I felt sorry for the man, as I think he was just following incorrect orders and was not briefed on how the entrance to the Gallery worked.  Staff must be better informed.However, once we got in, we had a lovely time and the National Gallery is fantastic. A must see. All other staff were very nice and Muriel's cafe very good too for a light lunch.",Some of the greatest artists and their works are housed here.
"May 2, 2022",We spent 4 hours at the gallery and still didn't see everything.  It was amazing to see so many great pieces there in person that we had admired for years.  It's a very popular gallery but we never felt like it was overcrowded.  A must for anyone coming to London.,Spontaneous visit and well worth it
"March 6, 2022",The portrait gallery was closed due to refurb so we headed for the National Gallery and it was a wonderful visit. Our kids (ages 2-8) had a lovely time walking around and asking questions about painting. Some famous ones to spot also. We noticed some kids were on the floor copying the pictures they could see so joined them and it was just so nice to relax somewhere and take it the atmosphere. It was half term and it was busy but not over crowded. Kids felt very welcome.,A must-see museum in London
"August 8, 2022","I loved the National Gallery. It has an amazing collection of paintings from various famous artists, and the gallery itself is a beautiful building. The children, who are not familiar with any these famous artists, appreciated the gallery less than I did. But the price (free!) was just right and there was no advance booking needed (just some queueing outside to enter). Don't miss this museum if you're in London.",Masterpiece Art
"July 15, 2022","I visited the National Gallery on a recent trip to London.  As an enthusiast of fine arts, I was excited to visit an art gallery of this caliber. I viewed period art from the 15th and 16th centuries. Most of the art was reminiscient of Christ, the crucifixion, etc. The remaining art work was that of the 18th and 19th century Europe. There were docents available, but it seemed that patrons were literally walking in front of me while viewing the art, which I found rude. I was in and out in 40 minutes.",Fantastic Art Gallery
"April 13, 2022",I have visited this gallery in the past and now have the pleasure of taking my son (12) to experience this himself. We took our time and while most of the artist's are unknown to him (and myself) you can't help admire the works. To see the artwork and some of the most famous artwork and all for free entrance is truly amazing. Well worth a visit.,One of The Best Galleries in the World
"August 13, 2022","We spent a few hours here enjoying some of the best painters in history. All of our favorite painters are represented, and one can enjoy from Rembrandt to Picasso. The Gallery was well organized as far as entry goes… The numbering sequence of the rooms leaves a lot to be desired, but entry is free, so not going to hold it against it. We went at opening hour (10:00AM) and had some of the rooms to ourselves. This is a popular tourist destination, so it fills up quickly. The A/C works well in there, so no problem to visit during hot summer days. The food in there is very good and reasonably priced. The staff is most friendly and helpful, so we highly recommend it. The entry is free, but donations are welcome.",One of the Best
"September 18, 2022","If you are a lover of art and museums, this is an important gallery to explore. Free to enter, the National Gallery in London rivals the Smithsonians in DC and Metropolitan in NYC.

"March 4, 2022","It's a free museum that you can spend as little as 30 minutes or as long a few hours inside. The inside of the building has some really amazing marble work, intricate ceilings, as well as some amazing frames. The paintings are nice as well but I enjoyed the other aspects more personally. It's a great escape from the rain and a good way to kill time if you aren't sure what else to do with your day. Plus! there is a really cool view of Big Ben right outside by the statues.",Worth your time
"April 3, 2022","I did a speed-run through this, as it was an impulse to go in, and I had a date with my husband later on to go to, but I spent 40 minutes and got to see all the artists I wanted to see. As a plussize person with back problems, I would love more seating throughout, but I suppose that's a covid or securitymeasure. But don't speed-run it like me - there's so much to see!",There's never been a better time to visit.
"December 3, 2020","Selfishly, have never enjoyed being able to wander the galleries so much since it was almost empty. Their crowd control and routing has been magnificently done. Even the 15 minutes waiting outside in the rain and cold was bearable thanks to the quips and encouragement from their security gentlemen.",Wonderful Museum
"September 26, 2020","First museum visit post lockdown. It was a wonderful experience being in the gallery with very few visitors but I think I prefer normal life with the crowds. This is a magnificent gallery, rooms filled with artistic treasures and save for special exhibitions all free.  If you live in London and love art it is worth becoming  a member.",A must see while in London
"January 24, 2023","The National Gallery is a must see if you are visiting London. Entrance is free. We went during the Christmas break so you can imagine it was crowded but still as the place is really big and we went 3 hours before closing then we were able to see eveything without the million of people around. I would recommend going on a Friday as they close later. All the paintings they have are amazing, you will find something you like for sure, all the galleries were beautiful and it's easy to follow a path and not miss one. Great place to visit if you like paintings and even if you don't at leats to have a look around.",Great art collection
"October 24, 2020","The museum is fairly large so you want to plan your visit accordingly. The art collection is deep and covers several art movements. It is well worth a visit, especially considering that it is free. There is a cafe' inside so you can rest when you want to take a break. ",See the special Poussin Exhibition
"November 3, 2021","I recommend going to the time-limited exhibit on Nicolas Poussin.  The exhibit explains HOW artists work and includes some wonderful companion pieces from antiquity as well as the famous triple portrait of Cardinal Richelieu, a patron of Poussin.  The catalogue is detailed and worth purchasing.","Great selection, just very busy!"
"November 6, 2022","Extensive selection of art, well presented with some good notes. Spacious and clean area, however extremely busy and from noon becomes difficult to view the art! However, much calmer at opening.",Lucian Freud + the classic masterpieces of this museum work wonderfully together!
"November 5, 2022","I have been here many times and I am a fan of this museum - and this time it was extra good for two reasons: it was Friday night, and open till 9 pm, which meant that there were many people there, and many apparently on dates, and discussing the art in a most charming way. The atmosphere was lovely, high spirited, filled with expectations and joy. Also: there was a Lucian Freud exhibition on display - and he was a master of grotesque human portrait (often with a dog). I have not seen this many of his works together before. And it all makes sense, from beginning to end, including a finding of peace with his mother. So my advice is to buy a ticket to the Freud exhibition and be happy. And always see some of the other masterpieces on display. This is best of the best; best from old times.",We are fortunate to have this jewel of a Gallery
"November 5, 2022",We had to queue to get in which took about 20 minutes however well worth it to see the superb. collections within. Highly recommend a visit.,Amazing exhibits
"November 4, 2022","The National Gallery is the main art museum in London. Very nice place for European art. One of the best museums ever visited. Go and see some masterpieces, make a little donation if you can.","Gallery is Breathtaking, Avoid the Tea Shop!!"
"November 3, 2022","I typically detest when reviewers write about something beside the actual attraction but since it is a safety issue I think it is important. Avoid the tea shop if at all possible. Shortly after arriving we realized we were famished and went down there. My husband ordered a coffee and a tea, and the tea was literally boiling. The cup was so hot it burned two of his fingers. The toilets only had room temperature water, it didn't get cold. I went to the counter, told a man what happened and asked for ice. They didn't have any, he was not remotely concerned but did say ""i have some burn gel if you would like it."" I did, and I also paid £3 for a tiny cup of ice cream for my husband to cool his fingers. After the initial concern we went to the restaurant and asked for a cup of ice which we were given. Yes, tea is supposed to be hot but not so hot in burns the skin, and served in very flimsy paper cups. Just a thought, if you need to stock complimentary burn gel at your tea shop the water might be a wee hot.","Wonderful paintings, if you can find them!"
"November 3, 2022","What a lovely place to visit, and it’s free! Terrific location and vast space to exhibit an excellent collection over centuries. Saw many paintings we just loved to stand in front of and admire. It’s extensive and a large number of individual rooms, each with a particular focus. We’re we’re there for 5 hours are saw pretty well everything we wanted. There are helpful descriptions on the side of each exhibit which is good. Nice to have occasional seating in rooms as there is a lot of standing time. We struggled to get a clear grasp of the layout and while there are overviews at the start by the time we had visited a few rooms, that was distant memory.Visited cafe couple of times, got seating both occasions but can imagine this area would be a nightmare in a busy summer.So pleased we went. There seemed to be a cut off for more modern art, but there are other London galleries we should visit to see them.",Wonderful collection
"November 2, 2022","Definitely commit to at least 2 hours, you could spend 2 months!  On a Sunday afternoon, the short line moved quickly.  ",Unbelievable
"November 1, 2022",So much to see and enjoy. very easy to walk around and seats for you to sit and take in the paintings,Great Freud Exhibition
"October 31, 2022",A rebel in every respect and his paintings never flattered the sitters. But hey who cares he was IMO a one off,Stunning!!!
"October 30, 2022",The National Gallery is a MUST !! I was stunned and a bit overwhelmed to be in the presence of such beauty,Worth a day to explore
"July 10, 2022","I love art. The National Gallery is a vast art gallery. If you love art, put on comfortable shoes and clothes, charge your phone or camera, and get ready to enjoy a spectacular art collection. I came for a specific type of art movement, so I covered a few art sections in half a day. The National Gallery is a must-see while in London.",Like what we like
"June 30, 2022",Only had time for a quick visit before going to see the eagles at Hyde Park. Every trip to London I go to view the painting of lady Jane grey being prepared for her execution. It's both beautiful and sad and transfixes you. My girlfriend's favourite Italian artist is canaletto and we spent some time mesmerised by the detail in his paintings of Venice. We will always make a point of visiting when in the capital ,Art for everyone.
"May 21, 2022","Something for everyone that want to see art. Entrance is free of charge, the docents are plentiful and helpful in many aspects. There are so many pieces to see that you’ll not be able to fully take it in on one setting - but that leaves you something for “next time”. Worth a visit!",Home away from home
"June 1, 2021",My favourite pictures welcome me back but I love discovering new gems as well.  Best is the talks and tours given by knowledgable and enthusiastic art experts.  Have been attending virtual Zoom sessions over the last months and can't wait to get back to London and the National Gallery in person,A FREE experience worth the visit
"November 20, 2022","We got there 10 minutes before opening on a Thursday morning, were entertained for free by animal protesters until the door opened, The 30 to 40 people in front of us in the queue were processed quickly. We headed to the main gallery and were impressed by how much space was afforded. We were never crowded even in front of the biggie masters! Plenty of food and drink options for us. We enjoyed the morning and price of admission was free, a nice break/treat! Worth swing by on your visit. Enjoy/",A classic of England
"May 15, 2022","The National Gallery is free and that's a big plus. It's a great place to pop into when you are in Trafalgar Square. You don't have to make it a special visit place.  Just wander through a few galleries and get the flavor. The layout is easy. ""Blue Boy"" by Gainsborough is the highlight now for good reason. It was just returned to England after being in a private collection in the U.S. for 100 years. Even if you're not a ""paintings aficionado"" you'll enjoy the gallery Blue Boy is in along with Gainsborough's other portraits.",How wonderful to be back in a gallery!
"September 11, 2021","The paintings are truly amazing. I know it goes without saying but it really is so much better to view them in person than online or in a book, and it's free - we're so lucky in this country to be able to see these without paying - make the most of it! I'd definitely book in advance. Apparently they limit numbers at particularly busy times and it's very easy to do this either using the QR code on the poster outside the gallery, or via their website.",Peaceful and calm - definitely worth a visit
"July 21, 2021","I visited with my daughter Tina (16), who loves art.We arrived at the gallery on a Saturday and there wasn’t too much crowding, relatively calm atmosphere and friendly guides. I really liked the architecture of the place, it was made of rough white stone that held up the roof, clever design.The Van Gogh and Da Vinci exhibitions are amazing, they showcase a portion of the most excellent art in England. Tina really enjoyed photographing them. The rich colours and abstract styles are mind blowing.",Over Officious Staff
"February 24, 2020",Whilst the galley contains the most amazing collection of paintings the staff need to learn to treat all visitors equally.I visited last week with my 11 year old (foster) son.  On two occasions he was admonished by staff for pointing at details on the paintings.  He was NOT touching them.  He witnessed adults doing the same thing and not getting told off.  As a result he did not want to look at any more pictures and sat as far away from them as he could.We left without completing our tour,Beautiful collection
"May 29, 2022",Be prepared for hours of remarkable art work from major painters. The building is very attractive and large for accommodating many viewers. This gallery is free! One will see the finest paintings by some of the greatest artists.,One of the best in the world
"September 13, 2023","If you are a student of art, especially Old Masters painting, there are only two other museums in the world to touch London's National Gallery. So many masterpieces, and I felt they were all hung better this trip than in the past, especially the Venetian paintings (and their collection is second to none in this category.) Breathtaking canvasses from Van Eyck, Holbein, Veronese, Titian, Rembrandt, Van Dyke, and Bronzino. A colossal Stubbs horse on a blank background. Moroni's incomparable tailor. A room full of ravishing Rubenses! Two Vermeers. Great big Turners (I was Turnered out after being at the Tate the day before.)A fun thing to do is spending some time with the Rembrandts and the canvasses formerly known as Rembrandts that were struck off the list and re-attributed. The museum is very clear about the status of each of their works. These were all bought by Kings, Dukes, and Millionaires as Rembrandts many years ago, and frankly, it is very hard to see the distinctions, but it makes for some interesting sleuthing. It might prompt some follow-up reading about the great Rembrandt re-shuffle of about 25 years ago.Also: don't miss the very good Impressionist collection, with a magnificent Van Gogh Cypress painting and a huge late Monet water lily painting to rival those in the Orangerie. Plus a very unusual Renoir painted in two of his different styles!Here's something to look for: The curators have cleverly put massive canvasses featuring horses at the ends of hallways. From one you can see another far off through a few rooms. It's quite fun. Also notice how little attention is paid to the daVinci and Michelangelo paintings. There's so much other good stuff that they simply fit right in. The daVinci drawing is really good (unlike much of his work) and you can get right up close to it.Right in Trafalgar Square! The National Gallery is one of the great places in the world.",Magical
"August 18, 2022","Magical. Wandering through the galleries it seemed that every one had a stunning painting that I'd known all my life.There was a minor problem, finding a way round. Pocket maps are no longer available from the entry desk or bookshop. The small guidebook """"A Quick Visit"" is a great souvenir of a enjoyable visit, but has no gallery map! The staff are very helpful, so we survived. Maybe this is a generation thing. Please don't forget the oldies. Otherwise what a marvellous place.",Do not Miss This Museum.
"August 17, 2022",The museum opens at 10:00AM and is free.  The collection is mostly of paintings and includes Michelangelo's and da Vinci's.  da Vinci's Madonna of the Rocks took my breath away!  The museum is easy to navigate and accommodates those with limited mobility.  There are also many helpful docents to answer questions.  Allow at least 3 hours.,Very impressive - but requires a lot of time if you want to see all.
"July 3, 2023",The place is amazing. Especially since the entry is free.The gallery has so many amazing paintings it's overwhelming.There are so many rooms and paintings that you really need to make time for it all.One can focus only on some of the more famous paintings.,AMAZING!
"December 26, 2021","The museum is free and filled with extremely beautiful artwork.  The guides are helpful and it's easy to maneuver through.  Also, the small coffee cafe has the biggest and tastiest almond croissant I have ever had.",WELL WORTH A VISIT
"September 27, 2022",This is a must visit place for all art lovers.  Entry is free (donations are gratefully accepted) & they have lots of paintings from all the grand masters to enjoy.Their regular exhibitions are also worth keeping an eye out for. ,Winslow Homer is a superb exhibition.
"September 28, 2022","We went for the Winslow Homer exhibition. He is one of the foremost 19th century US artists. We thought the exhibition was superb, with plenty to see and a good variety of his work. The paintings were grouped by subject matter and also by the location. There was plenty of interesting explanation by the curators but some of it was probably a little wide of the mark as the artist didn't like to explain his work at all.",St Francis of Assisi
"August 2, 2023",This is a spacious and well set out exhibition but is largely a collection of religious paintings completed some 300 years after the alleged date of death of St Francis.  There are also clips from more recent movies but hardly any artefacts from near the time of his life - not surprisingly.  It will be mainly of interest to religious experts and also Italians. The power of the story of the life of St Francis is demonstrated by this exhibition.,FREE! No need reservation
"May 3, 2022","What a cool place! FREE Entrance!March 2022 - You don't need to reserve your time to enter the museum, even with no reservation they will let you go in. Amazing art! Don't fancy see everything as the place is gigantic. Impossible to see it all at once. In front of the building there is the Trafalgar Square.",Wonderful gallery with works from outstanding artists
"June 5, 2022","We loved touring the gallery.  Many works of great artists such as Monet, Renoir, Donatello, Gauguin, Michelangelo, Van Gogh, Raphael, etc.  Allow at least a half day for this tour and if possible, a full day.  ",St Francis of Assisi

"January 5, 2022","My middle daughter wanted to visit a museum and we had not been here before. My youngest 9 even enjoyed herself! The place was well organised and staff were friendly and approachable. I would advise booking a ticket beforehand, there is an optional donation but it isn’t that much. A place worth visiting.",Coping well with COVID-19 
"September 7, 2020","I visited to see the Titian and Maes exhibitions, which were both good. Although the Titian was set in the main galleries to provide more space for social distancing, this didn’t detract, though I was out of the exhibition before I realised. There were definitely fewer people and the Gallery was properly enforcing timed entry. And the art is pretty good!",TWO visits in past 4 months!
"July 10, 2022","I saw the Gainsborough Blue boy and the wonderfully done Raphael exhibit in April but did not have the time to see other rooms. Ii just returned from in early July second visit and took in the 3 routes which cover 14,15,16,17 and 18,century masters. Plan to spend at least 6 hours to really absorb the wonderful collections.",Room to move and view
"June 13, 2021","With Covid, you need to make sure that you book your time slot. With this and designated routes that you have to take, it actually means that you aren't getting large groups in a few galleries. People are more spread out and I think you actually have a calmer visit.We had a 9 and 7 year old in our group. Following the green route we saw enough to capture the children's imagination, but I don't think they would have wanted to spend much longer in the gallery. The only disappointment was seeing a disabled gentleman being turned away from the coffee shop as he didn't have a card to pay. He only had cash. I appreciate the difficulty with cash, but remember, not everyone has access to cards.","For art lovers, this is London's most important place to visit"
"October 15, 2022",One of the best things about the National Gallery is that it is free. Not to mention that it is centrally located. So I recommend not trying to see everything in one visit. Go in for an hour or so and enjoy the painting until you've had enough. Then return in a day or two to see some more. And again and again. Why not?,A must see!
"July 6, 2022","The museum has a rich variety of rare historical pieces. Greek, Asian and Islamic and Christina history placed with such elegance. There is something to see for every generation. Not the best place for children. Lots to learn and enjoy. I plan to go back. A must see.",Turner on tour
"January 31, 2023","I have to admit, I could happily have sat in some areas all day. Seeing these paintings in person makes you realise the talent these artists had and shared with the world. I am biased as I adore the works of Turner and for me,  these were the stars of the gallery. Seeing his work in person made me feel many different emotions and for me , that’s what art should be, how it makes you, the individual feel. A free visit, donations are very much a must as you are preserving history for future generations so be generous and pop some donations I. The boxes to ensure we keep these wonderful works safe forever!",Muriel’s Expresso Bar
"January 17, 2023","I stopped off at this bar to buy a cup of tea. My sister who was with me wanted a drink of water. This was refused. They were selling small glass bottles of water for £2.80. I was , somewhat reluctantly, directed to a drinking fountain but there were no cups there. My sister and I are independent pensioners and able to manage but I think all bars and cafes should provide drinking water on request. Children and elderly people can easily become dehydrated on a day out in London and charging £2.80 is quite simply a rip off.",Best Art Museum in London
"May 27, 2023","One of the last things we saw on our England trip was the National Gallery.  While I had see both Tate's, this was the best art museum in London with the most diverse collection with the best artist and pieces.  The paintings are masterpieces by the greatest artists, de Vinci, Titian, and Vermeer to Impressionist like Monet, Manet and Renoir and Post Impressionist like Suerat, Cezanne and Van Gogh.  There were even interesting paintings from British history.  All of this it a great building that was decorated for the season.  Again, there are many art museums in London, but this is the best.",Wonderful Experience with the Old Masters
"August 24, 2022","Absolutely loved our visit to the National Gallery! Seeing the Old Masters - Rembrandt, Monet, Manet, Titian - live, up close and personal was a dream come true. We could have spent many more hours in here. It is absolutely a must see destination for any self respecting art enthusiast!",Amazing!
"January 19, 2023","one thing that i love about British Museum is the free entry. I enjoyed walking around the national gallery, a wonderful museum for classic art lovers with famous paintings fro VanGogh, Monet and others. If you have time please go and visit it. ",World class art gallery that is free and accessible to the public
"August 20, 2023","Incredible art gallery that I love and have returned to about once per year for about 10 years (almost every time I am in London from the US).Special shout-out to Alan who works there and made my entire day during a recent visit. Alan is passionate and knowledgeable about art. I was concerned because I could not find my favorite Claude painting (Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba) and Alan not only immediately knew what painting I was describing, but knew where they moved it. He also knew key facts about the work, artist, and reason for where it was moved too. Thank you Alan and National Gallery for another memorable trip - See you soon!",A must-visit for anyone looking to explore the world's greatest art
"February 9, 2023","With over 2,300 paintings from the 13th to 19th centuries, the museum offers a unique insight into the history of art. From Renaissance masterpieces to Impressionist masterpieces, there's something for everyone. It's a great way to experience the best of European art in one place.",Great gallery
"April 15, 2021",Great spot located in Trafalgar Square. We've been to the Gallery many times before although on this occasion we didn't go inside. It looks really  historic on the outside and some of the pieces on the inside are fantastic. Really recommend visiting when in London.,FAMOUS ART
"January 13, 2023",I could spend a whole day in here but due to limited time I only saw maybe 75% of the gallery.  I printed out a map prior to arriving and circled the rooms of which pieces I HAD to see. My favorite was Van Gogh. Be prepared to wait since that's where it's mostly crowded. ,Brilliant... apart from the mobile phones everywhere!
"May 19, 2023","Though the art is exceptional, please, please why do you need to take photos of every single piece! I had a camera shoved in front of my face multiple times around this breathtaking gallery. I’m hopeful the National will start to do something about this problem when viewing art, to actually view it... taking selfies in the corner of the gallery or do your own personal photoshoot is just not what these special places are about!",A wonderful place to visit
"April 26, 2023","We were pleasantly surprised at how many wonderful artists works can be seen here: Degas, Monet, Manet, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Constable, Turner… the list goes on. We spent a few very enjoyable hours wandering round and appreciating this fabulous place. If you’re visiting London it should definitely be on your to do list.",(In)accessible
"December 20, 2022","I’ve been before, and this is of course one of the world’s premier art collections.  But on consecutive days this week, I was faced with long queues to get in.  This never used to be a problem. There was a big entrance right in the middle which now seems to have been closed off, leading to a bottleneck situation. I find it rather ironic that something presumably done in order to improve accessibility has actually made it more inaccessible.",Must in London
"May 1, 2023","Located in the Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery is an excellent art gallery, hosting lots of iconic artworks. In my opinion, it's a must see. The entrance is free, which surprised me when I planned my trip to London.",Super After Impressionism exhibition 
"May 5, 2023",We came here for the After Impressionism exhibition which covered the period from about 1886 until 1914. It is a huge exhibition in 8 rooms and contains many paintings I haven't seen before probably as they are in private collections. We were enthralled and spent 2 hours here. I particularly liked the Van Gogh paintings. I thought the narrative within the rooms was a bit confused though.,Dreadful jobsworth and pointless exercise in time slots when they were not observed anyway.
"October 21, 2021","When looking at website it states walk in tickets available each day, but when arriving  Jobsworth on the door will ask if you have a smart phone, tell him no and he will let you walk in and get a ticket straight away from the desk which yau can then throw in the bin as no one checks it. However if you say yes you can then join the crowd of people outside who are all stood in the rain trying to get the ticket booking to work. The funny thing is, that after going through this pointless exercise you can then mingle with all the maskless people inside. I only found this out about the ticket as we stood outside with other furious and wet people because I happened to hear an old couple say that they had no internet, so we did the same and were ushered straight in.",3 Hours and you are done
"December 19, 2023",Any museum of this scope and magnitude can be a challenge. Museum Fatigue will set in after about three hours of exploration. You'll know that you are ready to leave when you walk by one-of-a-kind / priceless / unique archeological finds and don't even notice them. That is when you decide to come back another day and go have a nice pint somewhere else :) ,A maze of extraordinary works
"July 23, 2023","A beautiful building with some of the worlds most famous paintings. I came for the Van Gogh works, in particular his Sunflowers.The layout of the building is a little confusing; I would have befitted by being given a simple map at the door as quite often I felt like I was in a maze with no middle. There was an amusing children’s gallery near the beginning, where kids from many schools around the country had created works of art based on a real painting. The theme this year was the sea and there were some beautiful and thoughtful pieces which I enjoyed. Overall an enjoyable couple of hours.",Nice relaxing stop
"December 9, 2022",This square is full of great photographic and historical opportunities. The fountain is beautiful and public bathrooms are clean. There were several cafes in the area. There is a free elevated platform in a building not far away which name I do not remember.,So Many Masterpiece’s
"September 28, 2022","This place is huge! We spent at least 3 hours and I don’t think we saw it all. Be sure to take your map with you because it’s like a huge maze. There are so many great works of art by so many famous painters. Van Dyke, Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubins, Gainsborough, Leonardo DaVinci, Botticelli and my personal favorites, the impressionists. Claude Monet, Manet, Renoir, Cezanne, Gaugan, Van Gogh, Picasso just to name a few. If you like famous paintings, do not miss this!!!!",Inspiring art
"July 23, 2021","My wife and I visited to view the Copernicus portrait and the new Bellotto exhibition. These are outstanding and inspiring pictures, beautifully hung and curated. The Gallery is dealing really well with the trials of COVID-19.",A must-visit for anyone interested in art
"April 17, 2023",The knowledgeable staff are friendly and helpful and the free admission is a great bonus. The stunning architecture of the building is a sight to behold and the convenient location is easy to find. It's a great place to spend an afternoon exploring the vast collection of artwork. Highly recommended!,Excellent selection 
"August 21, 2023","Wow, so many wonderful pieces of art. Highlights were from Pablo Picasso, George Seurat and of course Vincent Van Gogh. It was an absolute treat to see my 13 year old spot the Bathers by Seurat, after enjoying reading the Katie books. Her smile was worth a million dollars.  Seeing the Sunflowers which she'd studied in school was also a high light for her. We also enjoyed the gift shop very much lol. ",depressing basement cafe
"January 23, 2023","Had coffee in the downstairs cafeteria.   Service from counter was slow due to poor queue management; staff were young and a bit overwhelmed by the weekend crowds.  Little choice of snacks from depleted  display.  Decor basic, really unfit for national gallery and destination visit.",Great but money grabbing bistro
"April 24, 2022",The catering's improved immeasurably since I was last here with the bistro offering a nice eating space BUT with a caveat..they weigh the salad!! As if they're not making enough money out of you.On the upside it remains one of the best galleries I've ever visited.,One of The Best Galleries in the World
"August 13, 2022","We spent a few hours here enjoying some of the best painters in history. All of our favorite painters are represented, and one can enjoy from Rembrandt to Picasso. The Gallery was well organized as far as entry goes… The numbering sequence of the rooms leaves a lot to be desired, but entry is free, so not going to hold it against it. We went at opening hour (10:00AM) and had some of the rooms to ourselves. This is a popular tourist destination, so it fills up quickly. The A/C works well in there, so no problem to visit during hot summer days. The food in there is very good and reasonably priced. The staff is most friendly and helpful, so we highly recommend it. The entry is free, but donations are welcome.",Loved the Raphael Exhibit
"August 12, 2022","In July the museum was overcrowded, many were not wearing masks, groups of students were there adding to the chaos, and it felt a bit overwhelming after pandemic lockdown mentality. That said, the Raphael Exhibition was a once in a lifetime event and I am thankful to have been able to see it. Employees and volunteers were helpful and well informed. It was a bit of a maze to find everything and having seen it all I was feeling as if I had been overloaded with beauty and so saturated I needed time to process it.",A hidden gem - the Ochre Restaurant at the NGA
"August 12, 2022","The National Gallery is one of the great art wonders of the world. Do not miss it, when in London. I am focusing this review on the museum's fine restauarnt,  Ochre, Tucked just beyond the gift shops and one door away from the madness of Leicester Sauare, the Ochre has a limited menu but offers a fine dining experience. I had the pasta bolognese which was outstanding. The service and surroundings are impecable. Treat  yourself to this unique experience - it enhances an already wonderful experience of a museum visit.",15 sunflowers!
"August 11, 2022","Flying visit, main entrance wasn't accessible however far left side another building, they were operating a queuing system and bag check. Moved fairly quickly,  once in I looked for the lift as I was not prepared to climb all those stairs. Floor 2, took a right turn to the bottom of a very long corridor and rooms, another right at the end and finally another turn and I was there....room 43!!!Surely these 15 sunflowers weren't really painted by Vincent?

"August 10, 2022",great museum with extensive collection. easily accessible right next to the underground. tickets can be reserved for free.,A must-see museum in London
"August 8, 2022","I loved the National Gallery. It has an amazing collection of paintings from various famous artists, and the gallery itself is a beautiful building. The children, who are not familiar with any these famous artists, appreciated the gallery less than I did. But the price (free!) was just right and there was no advance booking needed (just some queueing outside to enter). Don't miss this museum if you're in London.",wonderful
"August 7, 2022",What a gorgeous place - you could get lost in it for days.  The art is so magnificent you almost become used to its wonder.  Though the audio guide was good my children got a bit bored an hour in (the philistines),Wonderful museum with a great display of famous paintings.
"February 27, 2023",It was my first time to visit the national gallery. I was stunned by the interior and the wonderful display of paintings by the most famous artists. The restaurants serve great food (salads) and the best espresso in town.,Very good visit
"September 5, 2022","We had not been to the National  Gallery for many years, so it was firmly on our agenda for this London trip. It lived up to our expectations, well laid out, easy to sit and gaze at wonderful art. Particularly love the Turner's andConstable 's .",Artemisia exhibition 
"December 19, 2022",Amazing paintings and story. Somewhat let down by the unpleasant treatment received in the queuing process. I was told to move when I sat on a bench in the exhibition. I was told for the social distance to work I could not sit around but move on. I was actually waiting for the people around the 4 portraits to disperse to not crowd them. And I also wanted my group of husband and 2 kids to stay together.,World class gallery showing iconic pictures
"October 4, 2020","Amazing collection of the superstars of the art world in a great venue. Unfortunately for us, as a result of its star status, it was incredibly busy so spending time with the masters was not very restful.  It just means we will have to try again at a quieter time (if there is such a thing?!)",So Much to See
"November 12, 2022","Whenever I come to London, I always stop by the National Gallery. It is one of my favorite museums in London! My husband and I spent about 3-4 hours at the Gallery. We made online reservations, but I don't think that was necessary. There is so much to see here, so allow plenty of time if you're an art lover.",Great gallery for Renassiance artwrork
"March 16, 2022",Was highly impressed with collection. Went on a Monday early afternoon and was still quite busy. Audio guide took assistance to actually get it to coordinate with exhibits. Very large so plan on spending several hours. Location is right on Trafalgar Square for before/after visit activities.,The building is more interesting than the paintings.
"June 14, 2022","I found the building to be stunning and the rooms spectacular. Overall, the paintings mostly looked the same. What I did enjoy was the student artwork exhibition and the wonderful gentlemen who asked my opinion of the work and had a discussion with me about children and art. He was very enthusiastic.",A great art gallery in London
"August 7, 2022",One of the great art galleries in the world so it it a must see while in London. The good selection of works in the periods from the middle ages through old masters to impressionism.,Immersed in Beauty
"September 6, 2022","So much beautiful art in one place, covering work of many centuries, in a building with beautiful architecture. There is so much to see that it can't be done in one visit.

"July 30, 2022","I visited the National Gallery in May mostly because of the Blue Boy painting. I booked my Gallery Entry ticket online, entrance: Sainsbury Wing, worked very well. Unfortunately I couldn't visit the shop after seeing the gallery as there was a fire alarm and everybody has to leave immediately. I will go there in September again.",you need more than view hours to enjoy them all!
"April 13, 2022","beautiful paintings, and beautiful building. But to have this feeling, you are surrounded by those great paintings is another level. Great atmosphere. it is free (sure you can donate if you wish).  if you can spare at least a half day to spend there , that would be great. And no worries, their cafeteria has best cakes! ",Interesting museum
"October 3, 2022","We went somewhat close to closing time so were slightly rushed. However, we still go to see the highlights. The museum wasn't too crowded and had lots of interesting pieces. The building itself is also cool to look at. ",Worth a visit - free entry!
"October 29, 2022",We had a really lovely time at the gallery. We only queued for about 10 minutes before going through security and bag searches. The inside was well manned with security and everything was sparkling clean. Lots of seating options and water fountains available which was pretty cool!,Always something to surprise you!
"August 16, 2022","I have been there many times and everytime something touches me differently. Rafael's exhibit is really impressive. And Caravaggio's Emaus Supper my favorite. The restaurant is nice good salads, modern service. good option for a quick stop",Huge Collection
"December 12, 2022","Wow, the expansiveness of the museum, and it’s free! Save for the special exhibit. A lot of really great artworks here. They cover a wide range of time periods. Big names like Renoir, Cezanne, Peter Paul Rubens, Manet, Michelangelo, Da Vinci. Definitely not to be missed! It was a lot to see, so plan accordingly. There are over 2,000 works here.",Second visit
"February 12, 2020",A long time ago there was so many people I couldn't see a thing and I gave up. This time I managed to see the exhibits in several rooms without any problem. But you need 10 visits to see everything this wonderful museum has to offer.It is a pity that some of the most famous paintings weren't on display.,Amazing paintings! Friendly helpful staff
"January 21, 2020",Wonderful classical paintings.  Amazing condition. Friendly helpful staff. Gallery shop had huge array of products & cashiers very professional. Really enjoyed walking through those rooms full of treasures of Art.,Worth visiting at least once in a lifetime
"July 21, 2022",I’ve been to London so many times over the years but never visited the national gallery. Worth visiting yesterday. Free entrance.,Great Collection
"July 20, 2022","What a treat A fabulous collection of old Italian and Dutch masters - think Rubens, Vermeer, Van Gogh, DaVinci, Michaelangelo mixed in with more recent works by Picasso et alOne can spend any number of days here but if you have only half a day like we did, choose the predefined routes numbered from A to CIt gives a quick bird's eye view of the works in the galleryI would visit again if I could",National Gallery

"July 17, 2022","My wife and I were in central London so decided to pop into the National Gallery.  You can not fail to spot something new, no matter how many times you visit. World class paintings well displayed. Although busy, it didn't feel overcrowded.No charge for entry although certain exhibitions are chargeable, I believe.Well worth a visit.",Fantastic array of works from some of the greats
"July 16, 2022","I really enjoyed seeing the paintings by Monet, and learning about other impressionist artists as well.",Definitely worth going to
"July 16, 2022",This was a nice relaxing way to spend an afternoon. Lots of interesting art to explore and so many rooms to visit.,Fabulous art gallery
"July 16, 2022",Great place to visit and free. I was slightly miffed that I booked tickets online and whilst they were free it was completely unnecessary; you just queue up at the door. The art work is varied and beautifully displayed. It’s easy to access and you can walk through and focus on your particular interest. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable. Gift shops are wonderful and have so many exciting things.,average
"July 16, 2022","a bit disappointed , with cleaning and mooding staff, some areas were close , or restricted access , however the toilets were very clean ",Masterpiece Art
"July 15, 2022","I visited the National Gallery on a recent trip to London.  As an enthusiast of fine arts, I was excited to visit an art gallery of this caliber. I viewed period art from the 15th and 16th centuries. Most of the art was reminiscient of Christ, the crucifixion, etc. The remaining art work was that of the 18th and 19th century Europe. There were docents available, but it seemed that patrons were literally walking in front of me while viewing the art, which I found rude. I was in and out in 40 minutes.",Good routes to choose if you stick to them
"October 5, 2021",All free unless you go to a particular event.  There are routes to choose to go past certain artists.  It can be quite difficult to stick to your chosen route as there is so much to see.  Nice shop.,Beautiful Art
"June 12, 2022","The National Gallery is a must visit if you are on London. While art isn’t my thing, I am still glad I went because I was able to see art from some really famous artists. Get tickets in advance even though it’s free!",Overwhelming experience without guidance
"June 11, 2023","Quite overwhelming to be honest. It’s definitely worth a visit, their collection is impressive. Seeing everything is almost impossible, and here comes the only drawback of it that I can see. The staff isn’t helpful enough, for example when I asked how I can get to something I was answered that I didn’t have enough time to get there( it was 30 min to closing). In my opinion it isn’t how you treat a guest. Apart from that great experience, but only if you have a lot of free time. In other case, you have come and try to see at least the highlights.",Always a delight
"January 17, 2020",Always a delight. Free to visit but fee for special exhibition. Special exhibition a bit steep priced. Well worth the time. Excellent selection. None of the time I follow the map and always see something unexpected.,You must stop in if even for an hour!
"August 18, 2023","We came here yesterday with a friend. We stop here for a visit every year while in London. It is free and has wonderful art from many great masters. Easy to walk around and soak in as much as you want! Van Gogh, Monet, Rembrandt, Pissarro and so many more. This is a must see in London!","Huge, so you're probably going to miss some things, but that's why you return"
"April 8, 2022","Love this place - any art lover will give this 5 out of 5.  But I will say, it's really hard to follow.  Some rooms are numbered, some aren't.  We spend close to 3 hours there and I'm sure we missed entire rooms.  Oh well, it was free, and there is just so much to appreciate.  Would honestly go revisit on every future visit to London.",Breathtaking and I am not an Art Fanatic!
"January 14, 2023","Awe inspiring paintings from 800 years ago to 20th Century. Van Gogh Sunflowers made me cry! I saw so many that I recognised from TV, Film, Books. Loved Monet’s Waterlilies too. And it is FREE!",Great rainy day activity
"October 15, 2020","Incredible building. Historic art work. Plenty of room inside so you can avoid the crowds if you want. It is very dark inside, so rainy day is best. It would be a shame to visit on a bright sunny day.",Worth a Visit
"April 10, 2022","Amazing collection of art. There really is A LOT to take in, so make sure that you give yourself enough time. I would suggest booking as well as it can get booked up fully at the moment due to covid. Avoid the cafe, it's very expensive. Even for London.",A Treasure
"March 23, 2020","The National Trust has provided the citizens of the world with free access to a global treasure. The permanent collection here is staggering in its depth and breadth. I can always spend more time than I have available and after numerous visits, I know I still haven't seen it all. ",One of those London experiences
"March 1, 2020","This is one of those places that has to be seen when visiting London.Its huge of course and its easy to immerse yourself into the spaces.The collection is very eclectic .We enjoyed a wide range of subjects , from pottery to fashion to architecture.The rooms were busy but everything was accessible.They also have wheelchairs for those with mobility problems.The staff were very friendly, and would often come up and suggest options and points of view.",Always worth a visit
"September 1, 2022",I love this museum.  The art collection is varied and the interior architecture beautiful. I miss the old entrance but the new layout works.   I go there every time I visit London and Trafalgar Square is always a great place to be. ,Great art gallery - especially 'Blue Boy'.
"February 22, 2022",Had to queue to get in but well worth it. Whole lot of art to see although the highlight this time was Gainsborough's 'Blue Boy'. Impressive painting. Good to see it alongside other paintings of the time. ,A MUST. 
"January 7, 2020","Fourth time in London.  First time at National Gallery.  A Surprise. Allocate 3+ hrs.  Pizarro, van Gogh, etc.   The xmas market at Trafalgar Square was a welcomed surprise. ","National gallery, every visit is like the first time"
"January 20, 2020","I love this place, great for Londoners and tourists from all over the world.  A great education for the young and old.My last visit was mid summer but just on the off chance as I was in the area meeting friends.  Cant wait to go again next year to see any other exhibitions that may be on.","National Gallery, world treasure!"
"October 11, 2022","I paid another visit to this treasure on my last trip in late September, 2022. I wanted to see some of my favorites and perhaps discover a few more and was not disappointed. I had planned to make this a short visit of ""old friends"", but wound up spending two hours. This is a place of worship for any art lover!",Great museum.
"September 5, 2022","Great museum, with paintings from several reknown artists. Worth a visit. Several floors with multiple rooms per floor. Easy to maneuver. Restaurant on site, along with many restrooms.",Simply wonderful
"October 10, 2023","Not much I can add about this magnificent building and incredible collection of works. I was happy to book a free ticket and make a donation (suggested). Great value, as I didn't feel the need for a guide. Plenty of group, and self-directed options, if you would prefer one. Fantastic day out.",♥
"May 24, 2022","We visited the museum (free tour) first thing in the morning, gallery was spacious. Visitors scattered and everybody had lot's of room. Place was clean, tidy and pleasant temp. Would have liked a map for the different rooms on paper (it was on the walls and maybe I just missed the paper ones), because the rooms a bit of confusing and there are many options.I also liked the museum store.",amazing artwork
"June 28, 2022","Im not a big art fan but I did enjoy the national gallery, great for art lovers.  And its free unless you want to leave a donation.  No air condition can get stuffy on a warm day.  Located right next to trafalgar square.",A must see art museum
"May 11, 2022","This was far better than I thought it would be - we actually came back a second day to see more of it. I'm not a huge art guy but my wife is so we made sure to see it but it was far better than I thought. Wonderful exhibits, well spaced, nice staff. Just perfect.",One of London’s best freebies!
"July 26, 2022","I still find it refreshing that it is still free to come into this wonderful Gallery. The staff are so helpful and as a wheelchair user, it is very accessible. One slight criticism, difficult to press the buttons on the lift and as I was on my own I had to ask people to do it for me. It will not dissuade me from giving them five stars , A tiny problem which was outweighed by a fabulous visit.",Wonderful
"February 23, 2022",A great place to spend several hours. Was not able to take my umbrella in - had to use cloakroom which I guess is understandable until i saw others walking around with umbrellas! £2 charge per item for cloakroom. An amazing gallery and well worth a visit,Great minimalist art installations
"June 21, 2020",Incredible modern minimalist art. I am a graphic designer and come here to get inspiration for my work. Great environment and family friendly. The cafe in the museum is friendly and has some great bites. highly recommended!,Amazing art collections
"October 28, 2022",Had not been for several years and really enjoyed my visit. Forgotten about the vast collections of art in such a beautiful building. Need to visit again as far too much to take in. Spent a couple of hours wandering around and it was great. Actually recognised a couple of artists' work.  Wonderful staff in every section. Highly recommend. ,Would highly recommend 
"April 22, 2022",Wow. Fantastic experience.  Loved it. Beautiful Art work  to see. Photos taken as a reminder of what we had seen. Free entry is a great bonus to see something so good.,Chock full of wonderful art but it is like a maze in there.
"February 6, 2020","This is another great, free to enter museum.Bursting at the seams with fabulous artists.But it is so overwhelming. We were in there for about 3 hours and it was more than enough, we had to get out for air haha! It is a rabbit warren of rooms that even my husband (who is excellent at directions) struggled to find they way.But saw Van Gogh's (yes I say it Goff) Sunflowers at last as it was on loan last time.",Well worth a visit 
"July 14, 2023","Great gallery with beautiful paintings. Definitely recommend a visit, coffee shop is good too. Advise pre booking your visit,  still free but can avoid queue outside. ",Rebooking of tickets 
"October 17, 2020",I had to reorganise the date for visiting Titian Exhibition. The staff via email were so helpful in rebooking my original ticket. No charge. I have also spoken to staff on the phone earlier in the year and the person was lovely. ,Incredible Museum
"March 25, 2021","I have always wanted to go in here and I am glad we did.  I was in London in July 2019 for a conference and had a chance to do so.  The artwork, paintings, statues, etc were incredible to view.  This is a place I could spend the day in, and would still not be able to see everything it has to offer.",Afternoon Tea at the National Gallery
"June 28, 2012","We headed to the Trafalgar Square area intending to head elsewhere for afternoon tea, but heavy rain sent us inside to the National Gallery instead.  We knew that their cafe served tea, but didn't expect much.  We were pleasantly surprised to find they had an over the top tea.  You don't get the typical afternoon tea atmosphere, but what you do get far makes up for that.  We were traveling with two young children and we opted for 4 full afternoon teas. After our waiter asked ""The full lot, for all of you?"" we weren't sure what to expect.  Well, when they set down four 3 tiered trays in front of us, we understood.  We each had 4 tea sandwiches, a scone with cream and jam, and 3 delicious desserts.  The kids could hardly make it through half of theirs.  I would recommend getting young ones a cream tea, and sharing sandwiches from one or two full teas(depending on the number in your party)  It was a real treat though, and a lot less expensive than all the other tea houses we looked into.  All that, and you are in the National Gallery, which, in and of itself, is not to be missed.  The building and entry themselves are stunning, as is the view from the front steps.  Once inside, you will not be disappointed by the collection.  We had to move quickly, as I said, traveling with small children.  But what we were able to see was beautiful.  I look forward to returning with more time.","""Teach Adult's about Art"""
"March 13, 2009","Because it is Great - and because it is FREE, I tend to visit the National Gallery a lot. Even half an hour or so here & there can be worthwhile, but that is not the point of this review.Some while ago, I was looking for things for kids to do, and came across the ""Teach your Adults about Art"" self-guided tour on the NG website, so recently I tested this out with my No. 1 Niece (now 10yr old).You 'borrow' an audioguide from the desk, for a 'donation' of 3.50GBP, you get a map, and off you go.We did not get around all of the pictures suggested, but both enjoyed ourselves looking at the ones we did see in good detail.  My niece made a handy discovery, which was that, as well as the kids commentary, the audioguide apparatus she was given contained the 'standard' commentaries too - so we keyed in the numbers for a few different pieces, and shared the comments from the kids and adults 'notes', we learned lots!  Because of the added 'extra' commentaries, we got a bit more insight into some of the pictures that we just 'liked' as well as those inculded in the kids tour.After about 1.5 hours though, she had had enough, but returning the audioguide to the desk, we were presented with 4 different 'activity' booklets for her, which I am sure she will make good use of.I thought this was a good way to spend some time, overall, and so did No. 1.  IF you are flexible, and don't expect to get around all of the tour, then it is a cheap, fun way to educate your kids a bit - and to let THEM educate you - it REALLY works!!",Best Museum in London
"December 26, 2005","This museum is the best museum I've ever been to, except for the Louvre. The architecture is beautiful, and the artworks are fantanstic. There's no entrance fee...Just donations. The museum is not too small, but not too big, so you can see it all in a couple of hours. And trust me, you will want to see it all because it is spectacular! Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Renoir, Monet...You name it, they've got it beautifully displayed. They also have a cafeteria downstairs, which offers a great selection of snacks. I ordered a selection of cheeses with a squash soup that was the best meal I had in all of London...And super affordable. If you like museums, this is the place for you. And, if you don't like them, once you enter the National Gallery, you will fall in love.",Absolutely worth the time and money!
"April 5, 2006","Excellent collections, superbly arranged, easy to navigate, good opening times, reasonable entry cost (donation suggested) and the best restaurant ever.The restaurant is a must if you, like me, have always had trouble finding a decent meal in London without mortgaging the house. If you get a chance, order the afternoon tea, the scones are the most wonderful I've ever eaten anywhere in England. Don't miss this when you're in London.",Don't try to do it all at once!
"August 31, 2004","The National Gallery is fantastic, but if you just walk round you'll be overwhelmed. Before you come, think of an artist or a period you like and use the gallery's website to see what pictures of that artist they have, or what artists represent your favourite period. Then, when you come, you can do that thoroughly.  I go for the Antonello paintings - only 4, all small and easily missed if you just stroll round - but if you look for them, they are stunning, and it must be the same for every artist's work.By the way, down in the bookshop you can get immediate prints-to-order of anything, yes anything in the collection.  Wednesday it's - as I write (Aug.2004) open til 9pm. Oh, and the coffee is fine.",Audio Tours are Great
"March 27, 2004","We visited the National Gallery in March 2004 and greatly enjoyed the experience. By all means, obtain one of the audio tour guides. They are free, but a donation is requested. I gave 10 pounds for four of us and was treated like a visiting tycoon, so you can probably get away with less. Virtually every picture is assigned a number, which you enter into the audio device to hear a minute or two of commentary. It allows you to create your own tour, choosing the works you like. Better than a guided tour, in that you can take in more pictures and you are not part of a large group straining to hear the tour guide and to see the picture. Comically, I found only one picture without commentary. It was an old and quite graphic depiction of Zeus, in the form of a swan, consorting with Leda. I suppose they couldn't think of any thing to say about that one. By the way, entry to the museum is free.",Great museum
"August 3, 2019",The National Gallery is a must visit in London. It has some of the most famous and incredible works of art that have ever been created. It’s centrally located and easy to get to. It’s free admission unless you’d like to donate.  ,A Must for any London Visitor
"February 18, 2006","The National Gallery is a must for any visitor to London - art enthusiast or not. The halls of the National Gallery hold some of the finest (and most recognizable) artistic masterpieces. I visited the gallery on a weekday afternoon and did not find it too crowded. To help my untrained eye I rented the audio guide (provided by voluntary contribution) which was easy to use and provides excellent background information on the 30 highlighted paintings and many others. A free full color map was provided that contained images and directions to the highlights. I was able to view works by Botticelli, Raphael, Michelangelo, Monet, Rembrandt and many many more. My personal favorites were The Virgin of the Rocks (Da Vinci) and Sunflowers (Van Gogh). I also visited works by Vermeer who was the subject of a recent film Girl with a Pearl Earring.",Priceless Art in a Grand Setting!
"April 10, 2004","While I agree with the American visitor from Sunnyvale, CA that the National Gallery does contain lots of second-rate art (and a few ""unfinished pieces""), it also has some of the greatest masterpieces of Western art in its vast collections. I made two visits to the Gallery in early April, and both times it was somewhat crowded (mainly school groups from France). Many of the works from the Low Countries, France, Italy and Britain are masterpieces that art lovers will easily recognize. The Rubens were incredible! Don't plan to see it all in one visit - each of the four wings will take appox. 90 minutes to view! The view from the front steps is also priceless!",Pride of Britain
"December 31, 2013","This public collection contains a breathtaking display of European art covering seven centuries. Entry is free. Look out for Raphael's Madonna of the Pinks, pre-eminent amongst hundred of treasures.",Phenomenal collection even better customer service

All the staff were amazing and so kind. Will visit again.",Wonderful experience viewing beautiful & exquisite art
"November 3, 2018","This Trafalgar Square located art museum specializes in paintings produced between 1250 and 1900, of which it has over 2,300 paintings. Some of the collections are temporary and change with time. Over the past 20 years, this is my third visit, and many of the pieces are new to the National Gallery. The art of many world masters are on display. This is a very impressive collection of paintings and artefacts.",A wonderful collection.
"March 22, 2016","What an impressive building to visit, with beautiful paintings by Rembrandt, Monet, Picasso, Van Gogh, Constable, and you don’t have to pay to get in.  However, because it is free it can get very crowded.We spent an enjoyable couple of hours wandering round and saw a superb collection of the world’s finest works of art.  There must be at least 50 rooms here, all tastefully arranged with beautiful paintings.There is a nice café in the basement where we enjoyed some tea and cakes.I would definitely recommend the National Gallery to anyone visiting London.",A very impressive art gallery and it’s free!
"August 19, 2016","The National Gallery is one of London's best known attractions and is free to the general public. However, they do ask for a £5 donation, which we were more than happy to pay. We had a very enjoyable visit; it is an impressive building with a superb collection of paintings, I was not expecting to see so many beautiful works of art in one place.  There are so many rooms, all displaying wonderful pieces of art.The gallery was not too busy when we visited and there are lifts for the less mobile and mums with pushchairs.There is a gift shop where you can purchase reprints of the paintings on display in a range of sizes and there is also a cafe.The National Gallery is definitely worth a visit, you really are spoilt for choice because there is so much to see and it’s free!",Impresses the fans of art
"July 22, 2019","Central London's main landmark is the Trafalgar Square National Museum, which immediately impresses the fans of art. Renowned works such as Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, Velázquez's Rokeby Venus, Turner's Fighting Temeraire and the Sunflowers of Van Gogh are now home to it. Works are organized in almost chronological order in the gallery. This landmark is linked by bus and underground in London, along with free entry.NIce to visit it.",Incredible! 
"April 11, 2019","It was my first time in this museum and I think that is the only one which show paintings of Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Tiziano, Raffaello, Cezanne, Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Monet and Manet all together! Incredible!",Awesome!

Even half an hour or so here & there can be worthwhile, but that is not the point of this review.Some while ago, I was looking for things for kids to do, and came across the ""Teach your Adults about Art"" self-guided tour on the NG website, so recently I tested this out with my No. 1 Niece (now 10yr old).You 'borrow' an audioguide from the desk, for a 'donation' of 3.50GBP, you get a map, and off you go.We did not get around all of the pictures suggested, but both enjoyed ourselves looking at the ones we did see in good detail.  My niece made a handy discovery, which was that, as well as the kids commentary, the audioguide apparatus she was given contained the 'standard' commentaries too - so we keyed in the numbers for a few different pieces, and shared the comments from the kids and adults 'notes', we learned lots!  Because of the added 'extra' commentaries, we got a bit more insight into some of the pictures that we just 'liked' as well as those inculded in the kids tour.After about 1.5 hours though, she had had enough, but returning the audioguide to the desk, we were presented with 4 different 'activity' booklets for her, which I am sure she will make good use of.I thought this was a good way to spend some time, overall, and so did No. 1.  IF you are flexible, and don't expect to get around all of the tour, then it is a cheap, fun way to educate your kids a bit - and to let THEM educate you - it REALLY works!!",Best Museum in London
"December 26, 2005","This museum is the best museum I've ever been to, except for the Louvre. The architecture is beautiful, and the artworks are fantanstic. There's no entrance fee...Just donations. The museum is not too small, but not too big, so you can see it all in a couple of hours. And trust me, you will want to see it all because it is spectacular! Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Renoir, Monet...You name it, they've got it beautifully displayed. They also have a cafeteria downstairs, which offers a great selection of snacks. I ordered a selection of cheeses with a squash soup that was the best meal I had in all of London...And super affordable. If you like museums, this is the place for you. And, if you don't like them, once you enter the National Gallery, you will fall in love.",Rude staff
"August 19, 2017",Happened to be here and thought I would take a look. The place is amazing and has some wonderful art to see.  Staff are rude and abrupt and really aren't customer friendly at all. All in all I pleasant and interesting place but the staff need some customer training. ,Beautiful Collection
"July 20, 2017","Right at the Trafalgar Square, it has a Beautiful Collection of Paintings and work of art. A must see Gallery in London.",Caravaggio - uncomfortably crowded
"October 15, 2016","The current exhibition seeks to demonstrate the influence that Caravaggio has had on other painters.   It costs £16 to enter and is a rip off, given you can't see most of the pictures properly.  On the morning we went, there were just far too many of us vying for the same small spot of space.  It really spoilt the exhibition for me and is completely avoidable if the Gallery's management chose to limit the number of tickets sold to a more reasonable number.My advice is to see the best paintings when they are back on permanent display in the main Gallery.  At lest then it is free.On the plus side: there is a good, short film, to accompany the exhibition that is well worth seeing.  Do remember also to take a booklet which has the information written beside each picture in large print - so at least you don't have to strain your eyes.One last moan, £1 for a postcard is ridiculous!",It is a must see for art lovers!
"July 26, 2016","We went there late afternoon to avoid the maddening crowds that usually take over the museums and galleries in the mornings.  We took free 1 hour tour with a National Gallery guide that was super informative but only scratched the surface of what this fabulous collection of art has to offer, therefore, we rented audio guides that took us trough centuries of the best paintings and stories behind them. You can marvel and be mesmerized looking at work of geniuses such as  Michael Angelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Goya, Turner, Monet, Van Gogh, Pissaro, Seurat and many many more.  Go there, you won't be dissapointed!",Always worth a visit
"February 9, 2016","Never get bored of this gallery, it covers everything, and now the outside has been redelovped , you dont have that squeeze around the outside and entrance,and you can now enter a. Great museum far more relaxed and ready for sujome great art",Sainsbury Wing Restaurant
"October 19, 2015",Thousands in or passing through Trafalgar Square are not aware of this gem. Ask for a table overlooking the square.,Just Like The Movie
"October 15, 2015",There's something here for everyone. From exploring the dinosaurs (just like the movie Night At The Museum) to inquisition into the human body. and its free. Beautiful old style building.,Amazing.
"April 10, 2015",Price and location are of course great.  Amazing to see these collections in one place. Accesible to old and young.,You can't visit London and NOT go!!
"February 9, 2015","It's simply the first stop you should make if you love art. Then hit the National Portrait Gallery (right next door), then hit the Tate Modern and begin the pub crawl after that.",Paid exhibitions at Sainsbury Wing
"January 18, 2015","On the whole, the National Gallery is great. However, after paying my second visit to a paid exhibit at the Sainsbury Wing, I feel compelled to mention the experience here.. I first visitied the Sainsbury Wing a few years ago to see Titian. The range of work in one place was a spectacle worth paying for that I am unlikely to see again. However, I was a little overwhelmed by the number of people crammed into the basement levels, considering that the tickets were on sale as timed entry, which would make you believe that safe numbers of people had been calculated. I doubt that very much.I visitied again this weekend, to see Rembrandts Late Works. Again, the paintings on show, together in one place were amazing, and I was also saw some pieces I was less aware of, particularly one of the portraits of an elderly gentleman seated. However, the overcrowding this time was unbearable. People were literally being knocked over. The whole atmosphere was angry and stressful as a result. I think it was much worse here than at the Titian exhibit, since a number of cases were positioned in the centre of the rooms, which aren't big to start off with. If there was something on the other side of the room you wanted to see, it was quite impossible to get there without physically pushing people out of the way. I barely saw any of the smaller sketches.It may be that during the quieter times in the week this is not as much of a problem, although you would think that timed tickets would safely limit the number of people anyway. Had there been a need to evacuate the building this weekend, a number of people would definitely have been hospitalised.I will try again next time, and take time off work early in the day mid-week in the hope that the situation is better. But I would definitely NOT recommend visiting a popular paid exhibit at the Sainbury Wing at the weekend.",Membership is a waste of money
"January 14, 2015",The National Gallery is one of the UK's most prized treasures but do not make the mistake of joining as a member. We did and travelled down from Newcastle for the Rembrand exhibition only to find that no priority is given to members. At 9.45am we had to join one queue of over 300 people trying to gain entry for the 10am opening and once inside the members queue was so long they estimated it would take another hour and a half to gain entry. The staff couldn't cope and I was embarrassed to see such an ill organised venue. I felt sorry for the visitors from abroad. We visited the Uffizzi and Prado last month and had no such issues.I love the Gallery but their marketing promises huge member benefits that it simply cannot deliver so membership is of no value whatsoever and is nothing more than a cheap con.,Overcrowding at the National Gallery's 'Rembrandt: The Late Works' exhibition
"November 20, 2014","Breaking a two year resolve never to visit another popular exhibition in a large public gallery again, I was tempted by the Rembrandt to become a member of the Gallery and visit more than once, at times of my choosing. I shouldn't have bitten the apple. Visiting this over marketised, massively hyped exhibition was a mistake. In spite of having booked a ticket for a time slot which I had been advised was less busy, there was queuing to get in  and queuing to view (sometimes even restrictedly) each picture. The art (what we could see of it ) was sublime, the experience in this badly lit (glaring and dull at the same time), depressing basement gallery was dismal. I have visited many major galleries and seen big exhibitions in other European cities, but only in London does one endure this crowded, jostling, catching sight of a painting over a shoulder, out of the corner of one's eye, wholly frustrating and unsatisfactory experience.This is an exhibition where the main thing on display was profit margins.",Rembrandt exhibition
"October 30, 2014","I queued for 20 mins for a timed ticket, queued to get in even though  it was the correct time.  Finally got in and could not see the pictures at all.  Way too crowded too many people let in.  You pay £18 to get in and then unable to see paintings.  Would not recommend going.",outstanding
"September 19, 2014","Everything was great! Amazing that visiting gallery is out of fee!near was St. Mary in the Fields, visited concert for surprising price - only 11 pounds! and it is in London!",Unfriendly place
"May 29, 2013",Guards will scream at the top of their lungs if you were not aware of no photo policy (I was actually photographing the ceiling and not the paintings). Lol. The art was pretty great.,Art lover's mecca!
"March 23, 2013","The collection of art in this gallery is outstanding.  The Sainsbury wing houses the earliest paintings, some dating from the 13th century.  It also has a wonderful restaurant.  The original part of the gallery has paintings up to and including the 20th centuriy.  Their masterpieces are too numerour to mention.  Since the gallery is free, if you have the time, it would be best to visit  for a couple of hours over a number of days, so you don't ""burnout.""",disappointing
"March 9, 2013","sorry I find art museum such as this one very boring: paintings, paintings, paintings.... and it's all. Quite boring stuff. Never again!",Always a joy
"January 18, 2013","A stroll or an in-depth visit, the museum will always have something new and exciting on. On top of that the food is always good so it makes a great places to meet friends and experience the best of culture.",It's the national treasure box
"January 6, 2012",It's hard not to be overwhelmed with the sheer beauty. And it's all for free. What a national treasure!,"Leonardo Exhibition, on-the-day tickets"
"January 1, 2012","In short: queue earlier than you think sensible.The Gallery does a fantastic job of informing people of their chances of getting a ticket-on-the-day by having staff on duty outside the Sainsbury wing from 8 a.m..  We went at the end of December and the earliest arrival had got there at 5!  We were there at 6 and by 7 there were about 150 people in the queue, each of whom could buy up to 8 tickets each.  The gallery staff went along the queue asking people how many tickets they were wishing to buy, to give them an indication of when to advise people that there would be little/no chance of them getting a ticket for that day.  On our day, it meant that anyone who arrived after 8 a.m. was advised that they would be unlikely to get a ticket and anyoe arriving after 8.15 was a definite ""not today"".The atmosphere in the queue was one of great camaraderie and there was much swapping of tales of cultural highlights.  Our four-hours in the queue passed remarkably quickly and it was fun watching London wake up.  There are plenty of establishments for refreshments and toilet facilities around Charing Cross station.Would I do it again.  Definitely, as the exhibition is beyond comparison with all the drawings adding greatly to one's understanding of the art on display.Whoever designed the exhibiton had great fun positioning the painting of Il Moro's wife and mistress: if you follow the former's gaze, she is glaring directly at the mistress (The Lady with ermine).",Pleasant and informative
"March 16, 2022","Brought my primary school aged daughter for a visit as we were in the area. She had been looking at Monet pictures in class so I brought her to see the real things.The building is beautiful. The location is fabulous. All staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful. We had prebooked tickets online but this was not necessary for our visit and we walked straight in. The site was busy, but no more than I would expect for Saturday afternoon. We only looked at a small section of art but we really enjoyed what we saw. My daughter liked our visit and would like to see more if we have time. All in all, very pleasant.",Lots to see

"March 9, 2022",The National Gallery is a must see in London. It's a vast collection of masters combined with changing exhibits. View one masterpiece after another as you go from gallery to gallery. The current exhibit titled The Prelude by Kehinde Wiley is not to be missed. Plan at least a few hours to see even part of the collection.  ,Always make a stop!

"March 6, 2022","Enjoyed my brief visit to the National Gallery.  All the masters are represented with works displayed.  If you're particularly into works from the medieval period, you'll find rooms and rooms full, along with later pieces from names you recognize from Michelangelo, Reubens, daVinci, Raphael, and impressionist masters like Monet.  Van Gogh has several works here as well.I spent about 2 hours wandering through.  Serious art lovers will spend all day.  Lots of people inside, but because the facility is so large, it never seemed crowded while I was there.",A Journey of delight

"November 23, 2020","These are English colleagues who made me visit this site, it was remarkable, very well organized and respect for health barriers",Superb gallery let down by cafe
"November 5, 2020","We visited the Friday before lockdown #2. The process for getting free entry tickets online the day before was easy. On arrival we had a very short queue before gaining entry to the gallery. We chose gallery route B, which took us through some amazing rooms (a few too many religious ones for my personal liking) but we saw some fantastic artworks. I was skeptical about the route system in advance because as a frequent visitor to the gallery (pre-COVID-19) I knew what I liked (the spectacular room 34 and then rooms 41-44) and stuck to those few rooms. This route forced us to go through rooms I never previously visited and I was surprised how good some of them were - Peter Paul Rubens in particular, who I had previously avoided due to my dislike of overly religious artworks. So thanks National Gallery for broadening my exposure on this trip. As a member of the Tate I'm well used to the members lounge experience, which hasn't been affected negatively by COVID-19. I was disappointed at the National Gallery to see that the espresso cafe was closed and was hugely disappointed with the once-glorious cafe. Cellophane wrapped pastries and coffee in cardboard cups. If the Tate can still manage full service, then surely you can do better than that?",Artemesia.

"September 12, 2020","The art is phenomenal. Da Vinci, Rembrandt, Monet, Renoir, Vermeer, Maes, Van Dyke, Van Gogh... Stunning!The one way system is supposed to offer Routes A, B and C, but there’s actually just a load of white arrows on the floor with no clue which route they refer to. And apparently route B takes 35 minutes but route C takes 25 minutes, but you see ‘everything’ on route C but not route B? One man went the wrong way and got shouted at by a Gallery guard - I thought it was going to get violent! 😳Oh, and on the way in the bag search guy clearly couldn’t be arsed to search my rucksack - just waved me through without even looking at me. Amazing art, rubbish customer care.(Would still go again though. Because art. 🥰)",I'd forgotten all the wonderful art here - it's free but museums are struggling so try & donate a little when booking
"August 29, 2020","One good thing to come out of the weird pandemic situation that we are all living in is that I have been looking for things to to do to replace things that I would normally do but can't.  I haven't been to the National Gallery in years but finding it is open on Friday nights to 9 pm - how great is that for us workers - I went for a couple of hours and I loved it.  It is a beautiful building, has the most amazing art that even people who don't know much about art might know a lot of and it was calm and relaxed and so nice.  I actually didn't have time to do all that I wanted so will be back to see the Artemisia exhibition in October - Renaissance girl power beating the odds so well worth a look! - and will do the amazing other stuff I didn't get to then",I Love National Gallery

"September 30, 2019","Strange enough that I had been a Londoner for over a decade but never found time to visit the gallery, only visualised the rooms in a DVD in my university's website, so this time I just popped in on my first day back to London for a short visit. It was as expected, so many paintings, from Constable, from Turner, most interestingly, a room full of impressionist paintings from the French painters of the Salon era. And of course, people were overwhelmingly excited seeing that 'Sunflower' of Van Gogh. But I loved Impressionism and Pointillism and spent quite a while in that room housed these two types. It's true that you need at least 3 to 4 hours to thoroughly visit the gallery, as there are so many rooms that you would miss something if you are in a hurry, but one member of our group had to leave for lunch so we stayed roughly about only an hour. I would definitely visit again next time I am back in London. I have taken quite a few photos of the paintings I liked and knew about, but refrain from posting them here cause I believe not one painting from the gallery has not been uploaded here.",Fabulous..

They put a lot of thought into making the historical development of artistic styles 'make sense'.

Admission is free (a fee might be charged for special exhibits) and the artwork going back 800+ years is outstanding.  Given the large size of the National Gallery, combined with the free admission, one might want to make multiple short trips to visit as opposed to one long trip.  One of things I particularly like about the National Gallery is that there is plenty of seating inside the gallery, to give one’s back and feet a rest when needed.",Supposed to be free! 
"July 14, 2018",Went to National Gallery for a quick visit as we were short of time. As we went through the main doors there were about five people as for donations to get in. When someone said they had no cash they were immediately sent to a girl with an iPad so they could pay with their card.

"March 26, 2019",The National Gallery and the National Portrait are right next door to each other so make sure you go to the right gallery! We did a quick tour of the gallery (around an hour and a half) and I had looked up ahead of time the pieces I wanted to see. The rooms are laid out by period so you can plan your visit depending on when the works you want to see were completed.,Nice masterpieces on display

"February 19, 2019","I could have spent hours more here, but I still enjoyed it. I got in line before it opened, and once it did, I got in rather quickly. It was crowded, but it got more crowded as the day went on. I loved the building itself; and I loved seeing ""The Monarch of the Glen"". I also loved Stubb's ""Whistlejacket"" (I kept going back to see them both.) I also thought the impressionist paintings were spectacular; especially the special exhibit that I had to pay to get into (it was SO worth it!) The location of the museum is also quite nice-- lots to see around there!",Excellent collection
"February 10, 2019","They’ve got Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Monet and many many more.Their gallery is outstanding! They may not have lots of works but the ones they have are beyond sufficient! Really easy to walk around and can do a full walk of the collection in a couple of hours. ",Must go

"October 19, 2018","I came early for my visit at the National Gallery, and I am happy for that. The museum is well visited and not without reason. The permanent collection is huge and the special Impressionist exhibition was most interesting. Unfortunately it can be difficult to find your way around in the museum, so I reccomend you buy a map.",Amazing and massive place

"August 16, 2017","Great collection! A must see for any art fan. They have Van Eyck's famous Arnolfini portrait, Van Gogh's sunflowers, Da Vinci, Boticelli, Titian... I could go on. And it's FREE! We went twice during our 5 day visit in London. My only complaint is that the floor plan is weird. It doesn't really have a clear flow by genre/region/period. ","Blown away by this place, and I'm not an art lover"
"August 1, 2017","WOW... this place is amazing... Im not really an art lover, but like looking at them whilst visiting stately homes, etc.. But this place is on another level.. You could easily spend days here to look at everything, we were here only a couple of hours, and probably missed whole rooms out.. But at least we saw the star attractions... Being in the school holidays, it was rather busy, especially in the popular galleries..A must for any visitor... and its free...",Bad facilities
"July 27, 2017","Visited the National Gallery on 26/07.2017 the ladies toilets were apalling. Wet floor, out of order sinks and general untidiness. Not good for a building with a large tourist capacity. Also.tea room in basement left a lot to be desired with uncleared and dirty tables. It is just as importantt to keep the public facilities clean and inviting especially wben after viewing exhibitions you want to freshen up and relax.",Calling all Art Lovers!
"July 6, 2017","A true treat full of old masters, impressionists, and more. Enjoy Vermeer, Da Vinci, Raphael, Holbein, Monet, Van Gogh, Botticelli, Cezanne, Titian, and the list goes on and on. Be sure to grab a map/guide that tells you where all the not to missed highlights are.",Two Italian friends in London
"June 7, 2017","Selected works of Michelangelo and Sebastiano del Piombo are featured in a show at the National Gallery (until June 25, 2017) highlighting their friendship and collaboration. Unfortunately, their twenty-five year friendship ended after a disagreement.There was intense rivalry for commissions among artists in Rome. Raphael was judged a better painter than Michelangelo for work done at the Vatican; this criticism was the impetus for Michelangelo to befriend and collaborate with Sebastiano who was skilled in the use of oil paints and vibrant color.Although this show received average reviews from a few art critics, I recommend seeing it because of the sculptures on display. The monks of the Church of San Vicenzo Martire in Bassano Romano have lent the original version of ""The Risen Christ"" for this exhibition; I knew that this would be the only chance I would ever have to see it. Michelangelo abandoned this work after finding a flaw in the marble; the face, back and right hand were finished by another sculptor. Nearby is a cast of the second version that can be seen in the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome. It was fascinating to compare the two and see the changes that Michelangelo made in the second one.The two portraits painted by Sebastiano that I found especially interesting depict Pope Clement VII (Giulio de'Medici a few years before (1525) and after (1531) the Sack of Rome in 1527. The effect of this devastating event is evident in the change in his appearance.Other highlights include a cast of Michelangelo's ""Pieta"" and a replica of the Borgherini Chapel found in the Church of San Pietro in Montorio, Rome, that Sebastiano painted with partial designs by Michelangelo. After seeing this exhibition, I headed to the galleries and was pleasantly surprised to hear a choir singing sacred music. It was especially moving when I was in the room with the da Vinci paintings. I hope to return again soon.",Extraordinary Collection

"January 19, 2017","I would...and I think I have..rated this higher than the British Museum as far as where you want to be on a rainy day.  This is a huge venue with a lot of beautiful art pieces.  I do have to say that the amount of religious pieces was a little off putting, but comparing everyone's interpretation of the same event(s) was interesting.  The street performers outside also added to a great experience.",Fantastically Interesting
"January 11, 2017",A truly inspiring collection of artwork.  We could have spent hours wandering around.  There are so many pieces of art here that you will already have seen pictures of or heard about - to see them in the flesh is remarkable and fascinating.It would be so easy to go back for further indulgent hours of pleasurable viewing.,"Not just another ""art museum"" - The National Gallery is a British Treasure not to be missed"
"October 30, 2016","The National Gallery is a source of great UK pride - as well it should be.  The great works of art and their presentation are excellent.  Give yourself at least 3/4 of a full day to enjoy this wonder.  Save some time to experience Trafalgar Square just outside the National Gallery.  That is an experience in and of itself.  The Lord Nelson Memorial is spectacular as is the rest of the Square - which is sort of the town square of London.  If you get an early start - you can visit the National Gallery, Trafalgar Square, and maybe even Leicester Square which is not far away all in the same day.",Superb gallery
"September 25, 2016",The National Gallery is truly one of London's wonders. Where else can you step in off the street to spend a few hours in the company of the Great Masters ? And all without any charge at all too !,Amazing!
"August 30, 2016","I came here on the 28th of August 2016 with some family, we got the train up to Liverpool Street and then walked to the gallery, an amazing walk. There was places you could stop off to get a drink and eat, ice cream and the walk wasn't even that long. To see these famous painting in front of you for free aswell was amazing, mind blowing. You saw paintings from the 13th century all the way to the 21th century, to see the different styles  of paintings was amazing, it was such a good day out and will be doing it again, it had everything you needed from toilets to food and drinks in the cafe However some of the staff could of looked a bit more happy to be there and I would recommend this to families with young children as they might get a bit bored but other than that it was an amazing day out and I'm sure we will be visiting again.",Excellent place to go

"July 29, 2016","The National Gallery is definitely one of the largest and most comprehensive art museums that I have ever been too. It hosts a huge collection of artwork from various countries, time periods, and artists that is absolutely surreal and sure to keep an art lover entertained for hours. Though the main building of the gallery directly faces Trafalgar Square, the entrance is located far on the left side (west). Admission is also free. The gallery is extremely large and therefore it may get a little boring after some time, so plan your tour wisely. ","Cezanne, Monet, Vermeer, Titian, Rembrandt and Many Others, Oh My!"
"June 12, 2016","There are few places in the world where one can see works by so many great masters, including  Cezanne, Monet, Vermeer, Titian, Rembrandt, in beautiful galleries FOR FREE!  The National Gallery’s seemingly endless rooms contain marvelous paintings of portraits, landscapes, still lifes, historical scenes, architecture, religious events and figures, and scenes of romance, country life, battles, nature, and the sea, as well as many other themes.

"May 8, 2016",Fabulous.  A great shame that I hadn't prioritised time to visit sooner.  Wonderful to see such a broad range of famous works.  Avoid going on a rainy Spring/summers day as it gets very crowded.,The entrance is free so why i was asked to pay
"February 3, 2016",I was there staying  in the queue  in the morning I arrived one hour before  and  I was the first one to wait....there were a man from the museum saying we need to pay for visiting even if it's free .. saying to pass in another doot...I didn't understand  why if the  entrance should be free... Anyway  I liked it....,Be prepared to spend a day or more
"December 23, 2015","We came across the Gallery while walking around Trafalgar Square (it wasn't our destination) and decided to stop in. Admission is free unless you are going to a special exhibit. It is a large but well organized gallery. We looked for and found the impressionist and post impressionist painters and were delighted in not only the works of a number of artists but  the number of works present i.e. about 15 Monet's. Unlike many galleries, picture taking is allowed as long it is one of the museum's own works (if on loan the no pictures due to copyright issues). The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. We asked about works by Da Vinci and were directed to where there were two in another wing. The gallery also has the ability to create a print of a large number of works in various sizes and finishes while you wait. As stated, we wondered in and spent about  2 hours. You can easily spend a day or more in this gallery. ",very inspiring

"November 2, 2015","There are a number of works that I had seen in books over the years such as Ruben's ""The Birth of Venus,"" and what a treat to see them in person.  This really is a beautiful collection.  Unlike American museums, you can actually get quite close to the work and see details that you would miss from a distance.  We appreciated the unusual display method of grouping works by different artists of the same subject, offering a remarkable opportunity to contrast and compare artworks.  Absolutely worth the visit.",Go when there's a Tour - available daily
"October 25, 2015",There are too many great paintings at the National Gallery. Do join one of their guided tours (free). There are a few tips:1. Try not to check in anything at their cloakrooms - they are super slow and will get you late to the tour.2. The tours meet at the Sainsbury Entrance (not the regular main entrance) you need another 5 minutes to navigate there if you arent familiar with the location because the museum staff does a very good job in getting you navigate the LONG route. (Tip: The Sainsbury Entrance is right across from a building called Canada House)),Historically interesting.

"September 27, 2015",This is an excellent art gallery particularly the education section for schools. Really enjoyed my visit.,London's Leading Art Museum
"September 24, 2015",Nice thing is that it is free.  You can get overwhelmed by all the artwork.  Might be better to take in the gallery over a few days and see a little each day. Some say it has the best collection of European paintings.  Would highly recommend for anyone visiting London.  The museum is located in Trafalgar Square.  You'll find a number of street musicians in the area.,Worth to visit
"September 13, 2015","Excelent collection and very well showed. Very important: its free, and as London is very expensive, this is very good",Visitors beware -  much of the gallery is closed due to ongoing industrial action
"September 4, 2015","We've just spent several days in London as the culmination of our trip around the UK.  A trip to the NG  was to be one of the highlights.  We wanted to see the great English art,  the Constables,  Gainsborough,  Turners,  as well as others  like the Vermeer,  Van Eyck and Rembrandt paintings. Unfortunately,  we were unable to see any of these as large parts of the NG were closed (with no signs outside the building and very little explanation inside). The remaining staff seemed to have little idea what was happening.  One told me that it might be opened by the following day,  another told me it could take months. As we were staying close,  we dropped in on three days but our target rooms were always closed.  On our final morning,  we were surprised to find the room containing Spanish golden age paintings was open,  so we did see the Rokeby Venus. Just not good enough for a national icon.","Impressive collection, but go early"
"August 28, 2015",I stopped here in the middle of the afternoon and saw some amazing impressionist art.  I left just short of an hour because the crowds were unbearable. If I ever go back to see the rest of the museum I'll go when it first opens in the morning.,You better Gough!
"March 29, 2015",Fantastic Van Gough pieces and the museum itself is beautiful! Worth a visit. Hungry after? Go to Cafe in the Crypt at St. Martin in the Field which is to the right of the Gallery if you're looking at it!,A must see for art lovers
"March 21, 2015","This is my favorite art museum of all time. The impressionist section is especially lovely. When I go to London, I never miss going and visiting a few of my favorite paintings.

"March 10, 2015","I don't think you need to like paintings before you enter this place. You'll be impressed anyway.The building is beautiful, and the collections are amazing. It's hard not to find a few paintings which will be inspiring or moving. Highly recommended!",Inventing Impressionism - 5 Star exhibition
"March 10, 2015",We love our visits to the National Gallery and this latest one for the fabulous collection of impressionist works and telling of the story of Paul Durand-Ruel  was a winner. We visited on a Monday and it wasn't too crowded which combined with the excellent audio guide made it a great way to spend a day off. Only criticism was the lack of room to leave our suitcases in the luggage store ment we had to take them to Charing Cross station.,Amazing
"March 10, 2015","This is a huge gallery with an amazing collection of art from many periods.

Also a few good dining options, 2 cafés for good breakfast/ lunch /dinner and that must have English afternoon tea, as well as a posher adjacent restaurant. The shops are also great, serious art books to those which introduce young audiences to great art.

"November 2, 2011","You do not have to be an avid art fan to be impressed byt the sheer grandeur of both the paintings and the place itself. A visit to the National Gallery will add to your understanding of  art, life as an artist and how paintings are made. There are two absolutely outstanding guided tours daily, free of charge. Probably the best guides I have ever encountered. You will leave after an intense 50-minute-tour with information on artists, paintings, motifs, colours, myths and legends etc. Extremely worthwhile. I place I recommend to my ESL students as well just for the guided talks.",a suprise
"September 3, 2011","We know nothng about art but thoroughly enjoyed our visit having seen a few paintings and artists that we recognised There was also a Norwegian exhition on at the time and we found a few paintings that we really enjoyed.

We sat there for hours discussing what we had seen. All in all a good place to spend some time. We willl definately go back to the bits we missed.",So much beauty is priceless...
"August 29, 2011","Just to be able to sit in front of the Virgin of the Rocks by Leonardo da Vinci and all other amazing paintings by Michelangelo, Monet, Van Gogh and many others is pricelss and fills your soul with beauty. Furthermore, there is a lovely coffee place and the entrance is free. I just wish rude and ignorant visitors did not try to take pictures of the paintings with flash when the guard leave for a few minutes. These pieces of art are very precious, unique, and belong to all of us, so show some respect and culture and DO NOT TAKE PHOTOS WITH FLASH - buy a postcard instead. The photo will look bad anyway! If you see somebody trying to take a photo with flash, I would like to start the ""embarrass him/her"" campaign - tell them they should not be doing that out loud so that the entire room can ear and notice the ignorant visitor or go and report them to the guard of that room.","I am a regular ""pilgrim"" every time I'm visiting London"

It is also one of the largest art collections in the world, and one of the best organized museums I have visited.  Every painting is accompanied by information on the painter, the origin, and its symbolic meaning. It is simply marvelous! I have visited it over 10 times, and my favourite painting is The Execution of Lady Jane Grey.  It a the full-size portrait of the girl who was queen of England for only a few days before she was executed in the 17th century.  You can almost touch the velvet on her dress!",So Much To See!
"June 17, 2010","The National Gallery in London is, quite simply, massive. I recommend spending a pound on one of the guides, as it was tricky to navigate. They are available in several different languages and show the layout of the gallery, with all the rooms numbered and named according to how the paintings are categorised. I didn't try the audio guides, but they are available for a fee. Entry to the museum itself is free although they do encourage a donation. There is a coat room for storing bags, nice clean public toilets, and several areas to eat.  Rather than eating at the gallery however, I went to one of the chain stores across the road (pret a manger) and got some sandwiches to eat outside in Trafalgar Square, then went back into the gallery for another wander. It's a lot cheaper to do that than eat at the gallery, and the atmosphere in the square is amazing.The variety of paintings is excellent, with many well known artists such as Van Gogh (my personal favourite), Renoir, Monet, Manet, Botticelli, Rembrandt and Turner.

"December 8, 2009","I recently went with my mother in law to tea at the National Gallery Dining Rooms and we were quite disappointed with the service.  The food itself was just fine, but the waiter was quite rushed and took quite a while to come take the order and then we never saw him again until we nudged him for the check.  No additional water for the tea was brought and I certainly don't think he earned the requisite 15% tip.  Definitely would try someplace else in the future.  Having made a reservation, the seating itself all went smoothly.",The best

"February 13, 2009","National Gallery is a must if you have even the slightest interest on painting and history of art. There are a lot of very well-known pieces here, and a lot of other not so known pieces, that are important and a joy to see non the less. It is a pleasant surprise to see that here, there is a lot of English art too, as in lots of other London museums, you can see exibits from cultures from all over the world, but not England its self !!!You need days to explore the Gallery, so maybe its better to focus on one wing at the time, or take a hight light tour fitst, if your time is limited!Main exibitions entrance is free, and staff here is in general very polite. Some donation should be done, to help keep it free and to maintain all these magnificent pieces of art!I will definately visit again when back to London!",The best museum in London
"January 20, 2009","I spent a year in London and went to all the museums and I do admit the National Gallery is simply the best. The building itself, overlooking trafalgar square, is impressive. The collection is great, it gives a really good panorama of English art. Every time I went there, it wasnt that crowed and the visit was quite interesting! It was really good to get to know more about English artists and discover how rich the culture is, because people generally tend to look English art down which is a shame!

"July 12, 2008","If you go to London, even if just for a day, make this a stop on your itinerary. the paintings are truly breathtaking, with masterpieces from so many periods of time and so many different artists. You can easily spend one whole day here. i suggest getting an audio tour, as it really enhances your experience with knowing the story behind the painting. Room after room, you'll find something that amazes you. This museum is a must-see attraction.",Favorite Museum in London!
"April 14, 2008","The National Gallery is one of my favorite places in London.  It can however be a bit overwhelming because there is a lot of fantastic art to see.  I am an art lover myself and I have spent many afternoons admiring their Raphael's and Botticellis, but I had the advantage of being introduced to the work slowly and over several months.  There's no entrance fee, which is awesome considering the amount  of incredible masterpieces there are inside.  There are also a lot of benches inside in every room so that if you want to sit and really admire some of the larger pieces, you can sit and relax for a bit.  I personally think the floor plan can be a bit confusing if you are looking for a specific piece and don't want to spend time wandering around a bit, but if you are an art lover with several hours to spare, you definitely wouldn't want to miss it!  They do also offer tours and audio guides if that is something you're interested in, although I don't know much about that since I have never used those services.",Best Art Museum in London!
"April 27, 2004","If you only see one art museum in London, this is the one to see! Tons of masterpieces that anyone with even a basic knowledge of art would recognize. Admission is free, but wouldn't mind paying if required (donations accepted).","Two Exhibitions, One Fee & One Free"
"August 23, 2023","My wife & I visited the National Gallery to see two very good fine art exhibitions: ‘After Impressionism: Inventing Modern Art’ and ‘Saint Francis of Assisi’.  We booked our entry tickets on-line to make sure we’d be admitted during the early summer holiday period.  We had also booked an Afternoon Tea at the Gallery’s Ochre Restaurant between the two exhibits, which was not nearly as satisfying as our art appreciation on this visit.  Access to the free Gallery exhibits is via the Portico Entrance, up the front stairs facing Trafalgar Square; step-free access & entry for special exhibits are handled at the sidewalk-level Getty Entrance nearby.  Ticket check & security processing on arrival both went smoothly.  The National Gallery staff were all very friendly, the facilities are modern & well maintained, and their gift shop is one of the larger ones we’ve seen at an art museum (with quality merchandise).  We would recommend art lovers visiting London take a look at the Gallery website for current exhibitions and attend one that suits their tastes.  A two-fer would be even better.",Beautiful museum

"October 29, 2020","Only thing stopping it being a '5' was the slightly chaotic queuing system outside in the rain. Once inside, everything was really good. The vastness of the galleries plus making pre-booking compulsory means everyone is nicely spaced out (distance-wise !) and so very Covid regs compliant. You can follow a variety of trails keeping to one-way flows. Plenty of staff available to guide. And then there's the awesome paintings themselves - so many great works - Monet, Constable, Turner etc. And it's free.The 'Sin' Exhibition was a little limp and over-priced coffees",Great visit.

"August 21, 2020",Such a great time in the galleries. So much more peaceful and less crowded than I remember pre-Covid. Very well organised and clean. No pressure to donate unlike some of the museums and the staff were relaxed and friendly.,European Paintings over the centuries at the National Gallery.
"August 21, 2020","This place is a huge sprawling space. Trafalgar Square is always teeming with tourists. So it is really crowded. I happened to be there on a day when the population was scarce. One just gets an idea of how big the place is in the center of the London. There were street artists performing there . A bagpiper was there playing a melancholy tune. The National gallery inside is large with a lot of paintings. And I think one day is not enough to see everything. There is no entry fee. There are small eateries inside. So one can relax and take a break from continuously gazing at the canvases. Th know a little more , read London-Life around the Thames at Papumashi the Nomad.",No stress and we could see everythig we wanted
"August 19, 2020","Our  'Post Lockdown' visit was perfect! From the queuing to get in, the bag check and stairs up to the toilets it was safe and welcoming as possible.  You didn't feel as if you were entering a 'COVID Complaint place as everything was done with the minimum amount of fuss and stress. I do recommend visiting the toilets before you start the tour to wash off all the hand sanitiser.We had tickets for Titian: Love, Desire, Death which was really interesting- but it was just one room. `I wish I had done a bit of research beforehand, but it was all well laid out with excellent explanations. We then followed Route C then picked up Route B and ended up in the shop and cafe for a well-earned cup of tea. They limit the number of people in each room so 'social distancing' isn't an issue and you are not peering over someone's shoulder. If you see a queue into the next gallery then don't fret, enjoy the paintings as you wait as the queue moves quickly.  An excellent few hours.",national gallery 24.7.20

"August 17, 2020","We have now been twice in August to this Gallery.  We live in London and have avoided it is the past as it has been so full of tourist groups that it is almost impossible to get anywhere near the pictures.  Not any more!You have to book online for a slot (free) & the slots are in 15 minute intervals.  That means that there are no large groups.  There are then 3 routes you can take - called A, B & C(!).  If you wish, you can do all the routes one after the other, but that would be somewhat overkill and exhausting.  You are not time-limited, so you could stay there for the whole day if you wish.The lack of other people varies room by room, but on the A route (the oldest art) I often had a whole room to myself (including the small Leonardo room).from early medieval to the 20th century.  Lots of famous names:  for example there are 2 room of paintings by Rubens.If you like art, then this really is the optimum time to go.The variety of art is exceptional -",Gauguin  exhibition sainsbury wing national gallery
"November 21, 2019",The tickets were£22 with no senior discount.The free booklet supplied as you enter the exhibition was excellent. It’s advisable to start with the 10minutes film about his life and art works. There are 7 rooms each displaying 8/10 ish art works.2 rooms have wooden platforms to sit on. We went about 11am when it was beginning to get busy but still possible without difficulty to view the paintings and sculptures.It took just under 2hrs to view the exhibition.,Endless London classic 
"November 21, 2019",I come here quite a bit with people visiting the U.K. or if I am in London with time to kill. It’s a nice gallery with loads of pictures and clean toilets. Good place to visit - free entry ,Terrific museum worth at least a half day's visit
"November 20, 2019","The National Gallery is tremendous. The collection of artwork here is amazing. We spent almost the entire day here meandering through each room and making a point of sitting down to really study some of the pieces. It was nice to see young artists and students in the museum doing their own sketches. There is a small restaurant area to relax in and a gift shop, which is really nice. If you are pressed for time read up on what you want to see before going in so you can plan your visit efficiently. But ideally I think any art enthusiast should plan 3 to 4 hours here.

"November 14, 2019","This is not a review of the gallery, which is spectacular. The cafe on the other hand...Paid £4.80 for a SMALL coke, not even a regular sized glass bottle. I ended up paying £6 overall, also buying a bag of popcorn, which was more appropriately priced. £5 for less than a glass of coke?? Ridiculous.",If you're into paintings...
"November 13, 2019","It has beautiful artwork and some not as popular but still famous paintings that are worth seeing, despite being a free entry it wasn't as crowded as we expected. We could move around freely without bumping into people. All in all a good experience",Nice Galleries
"November 12, 2019","The museum was free to enter but they do ask for a donation. Which is pretty standard for many museums. The art work is displayed beautifully.

"June 20, 2020","Magnificent pinoteca smaller than the Prado or the Louvre. In a spectacular building in Trafalgar square. From works by the most important European painters such as: Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Rembrandt, Velásquez, Monet, Manet or Vincent van Gogh. I would highlight the Virgin of the rocks and the Sunflowers. Visiting this gallery in London is a must. Free entry all the time.",Impressive
"June 15, 2020","Given it was a rainy day the gallery was quite busy with a line to get in however as it is so big with so many rooms this was not an issue at all! The art and the history behind it was just amazing. Best of all its free! Highly recommend if you like art and even if you don't, just pop in and check out the grandeur.",AMAZING!!
"June 13, 2020","We are  so lucky that we can go to London and enter such places like the National Gallery for free.  You don't have to be a ""luvvie"" to enjoy this experience - there is something here for everyone.  In truth it is overwhelming when you see what the National Gallery has to offer.  It breathes history - the location, the building and the collections inside.  As I get older I appreciate more and more what has gone before me. Take time out to visit the National Gallery (more than once).",Poor

"November 5, 2019","There are few museums that can rank with the National Gallery for the width and quality of collection.  Rooms dedicated to artists, and the greatest of their kind.

"November 4, 2019","The National Gallery is huge and free. Although, the staff do try to pressure you to make a donation of $10. The selection of art definitely caught my attention. There were so many rooms and so many people. I only spent about 45 minutes browsing before I got overwhelmed by it all.

"May 10, 2020","I enjoyed the Gaugin Exhibition very much.  However, one thing I did not enjoy was my visit to the restaurant afterwards.  It was  dimly lit and very uninviting.  I decided to order a small pizza which cost £7.90.  When it was delivered to my table, I could see immediately that the pizza had been overcooked because the crust was dark brown.  I attempted to cut a piece off to eat it but was unable to get my knife through the pizza. I turned it over and could see that it was black underneath.  I then asked to see the Manager and showed it to him.  Simultanelously I asked to get a refund because I was not prepared to accept this as an edible pizza.  He then returned to the cash desk and refunded my money.  He did not apologise to me, which I thought was totally unacceptable.  I could not in any way recommend this restaurant.

"October 27, 2019","It's free and one can see some very famous paintings, but the crowds and the pieces that were out on loan really dampened my enthusiasm.  We spent less time than planned there.  We saw what we wanted to see and left.  It really wasn't a place to linger and reflect.",An unparalleled experience
"October 27, 2019","We had limited time at the National Gallery, but oh my it was such a delight to be able to roam those halls.  The building in and of itself is gorgeous and breathtaking on its own.  Add the pristine preserved centuries old paintings that are expertly curated and displayed and it is an awe-inspiring experience.  To see the works of Monet, Manet, Van Gogh, Titan, Cezzane, among the other greats is such a privilege and unparalleled experience.  Even better was to see young children sketching paintings and in amazement at the works before them as they listened to expert curators.  Perhaps the best part is that admission is free, although you will be heavily bombarded by employees at the entrance to the exhibits to provide a donation.  A small and worthwhile price to pay for an unparalleled opportunity...",Beautiful Museum

"October 23, 2019",I combined this visit with a visit to the RA. Unfortunately the major exhibition did not start until the next day so i will return at a later date. I think the regular exhibits are still worth seeing and I would recommend becoming a member if possible.Well worth it,Amazing artwork. Masterpieces everywhere you look
"October 23, 2019",The National Gallery in London is a treasure trove of artwork. I recommend either having a guide or renting the audio tour as it is too much to take in without some sort of guide. Allow yourself plenty of time. Take breaks at one of the inside places to eat and enjoy.,A Must See
"October 23, 2019","A wonderful museum, with free entry and an extensive collection with a superb educative theme. One of the best I have ever visited. If going as an adult it is an exhilarating experience and if you are going with kids then it will be an experience they will never forget. Right from the dinosaur section, to the mammals section and the wonderful display on whales and other marine life , the museum leaves you spell bound. God number of cafeteria’s and washrooms make the experience even better. Keep 4-5 hours handy.",The world of art at your feet
"October 22, 2019","It's astounding that at no charge one can walk into this wonderful gallery of paintings from up until about 1900. There are representatives from all major areas of Western art.

Since there is no charge to enter the gallery, you can take your time and enjoy each area without rushing, because you can come back another day to continue. ",One of the best museums in the world and it's FREE.
"October 22, 2019","(Special exhibitions in the Sainsbury Wing are NOT free and can be expensive) A great museum.  If you are interested in art, you will definitely want to visit.

"October 20, 2019","I was passing through London and was trying to decide how to spend my afternoon and realized that the National Gallery was within easy walking distance of my location.  I love wandering through art galleries so I jumped at the chance to visit this place that I'd heard so much about.The National Gallery did not disappoint.  Wandering through the galleries you find awe-inspiring paintings by Da Vinci (Virgin of the Rocks), Caravaggio (The Supper at Emmaus), Van Gogh (Sunflowers), Seurat (Bathers at Asnieres) to name just a few.  The gallery truly lives up to its description as one of the finest collections of paintings in the world.There is no admission charge to enter, but be prepared that you will be asked to make a donation as you enter.  Maps are available but there is a charge of 2 pounds for them.  There is a coffee bar and a cafe where you can get a coffee, sandwich, or something more substantial.  I believe that there is also a restaurant, but I did not try it.In summary, if you have a few hours you can spend at the National Gallery, I'm quite sure you will find it is time well spent.  I recommend more than 3 hours, but if you want to just hit the highlights, then 2-3 hours might be enough.",Among the greatest art collections in the world

"October 17, 2019",This free art gallery is well worth a self paced visit where even though the paintings may overwhelm you you can return often to visit your favourites.,The always excellent National Gallery
"October 17, 2019","The setting alone, in Trafalgar Square, is always a good reason to visit the National Gallery. But its collection remains among the best anywhere. Also,  it is easy to navigate; unlike, at the moment, the Louvre, which is a huge mess, especially given the current boondoggle for viewing the Mona Lisa.  And the National still has free admission!!

I recommend to go to the icons first, the Impressionism rooms, Van Gogh, Monet, Cézanne, Renoir... then Boticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael and other renaissance masters, and finally other rooms. The permanent exhibition is free as in all public museums in London. ","One of the most amazing collections in the world, and it is free!"

We focused on the Impressionists, and the museum has a beautiful collection of these.  There is a small cafe downstairs, and one can sit outside and people-watch while sipping your wine.  Pair this up with a meal and concert at St. Martin in the Fields, across the street.",Beautiful

For a free gallery it really is outstanding.",Gems of the City
"October 3, 2019","There are gems from every era starting with Medieval art to the Impressionists. While each room had its renowned pieces, I was especially impressed with the number of Raphaels, Rembrandts and breadth of Impressionist artists represented here.  I would love to go back and spend even more time in the gallery. Thanks for a lovely afternoon!",Perfect free bathroom location and cafe
"October 3, 2019","Ok, I’ll admit I didn’t even check out this FREE museum but I was just walking by and saw the “free” sign so I had a hunch it would be a good toilet spot. BINGO, as soon as you walk in turn right and head through the self serve cafe area and follow the signs to the bathroom. Then when you’re done you can go to the sit down and get waited on cafe or the self serve area where they have yummy pastries, coffee, tea, etc. You grab what you want and then pay for the goodies and find a seat inside or get it to go and sit out on the ground or steps.

There is a bag check going in.The Gallery is free to the public, but they do collect donations, so please consider donating if you love the Gallery like I do. Well worth it. There is also a gift shop downstairs that has a wonderful selections of gifts and souvenirs. Love love love the National Gallery",Memorable Experience 
"October 1, 2019",This Museum rivals any I have seen anywhere. The collections are outstanding and the facility itself is beautiful inside and out. I would recommend obtaining a floor plan and marking off galleries as you go through. The rooms are a maze and I found myself doubling back on some I had seen. Be sure to set aside at least three hours to get the full experience of the Museum. If you find yourself overwhelmed take a break in the cafe. I found the impressionists section simply amazing. Admission is free. The staff are courteous and helpful. The is a cloakroom to leave your coats for a small fee. ,Fantastic museum - great to spend a whole afternoon at
"September 30, 2019",You must check out the National Gallery if you are visiting London. There is so much art work and history contained within the building and the incredible artwork from painters such as the Renaissance. Would suggest that you prepare 2-3 hours wandering slowly through the hallways - must go! :) ,One of the many free museums in London 
"September 29, 2019",You can easily spend several hours wandering through the museum. There are phenomenal collections of artworks. The Sainsbury entrance is located off of Trafalgar square. Even the flooring in the central lobby is a work of art. A mosaic of 1/2 inch square tiles.,Impromptu visit
"September 29, 2019","We popped in as the rain was torrential.  Was very open, plenty of places to sit down whilst looking at the art on display.  Clean rest rooms and a cafe too. ",Interesting as a building and for the exhibitions.
"September 28, 2019","On a limited time scheduled we enjoyed exploring a couple of the displays. The forecourt to the gallery was bustling with artists performing. So much to see outside, possibly because it was school holidays. Worth a visit.",A fantastic free gallery in London
"September 28, 2019","On a recent visit to London I spent a couple of hours looking around this magnificent art gallery. Two hours was nowhere near enough time to see all there is on offer, but it was great to spend what little time I could. Must factor in more time on my next visit.",It is a very emotional
"September 26, 2019",It had me in tears. So pretty like a rainbow ting. It is a national treasure and like the cinema *************************,I was amazed by the paintings on exhibit 
"September 14, 2019","A few hours well spent, they have some paintings of some of the greatest artists ever lived, Da Vinchi, Canaletto, Monet and soooooo many more.

"September 14, 2019",We sadly only had about an hour to visit this wonderful museum. But we could easily have stayed another or more hours. What a charming museum full of gems. We loved it.,Amazing collection!
"September 13, 2019","I spent a little more than 3 hours here on a Thursday afternoon, and was very impressed by the breadth and depth of the collection. I happened to arrive just before a tour started, and very much enjoyed the docent's discussion of the first work; however, the group was so large that half of us lost him on the way to his next stop (Nick walked too quickly for those of us lagging behind to take pictures). I am glad that I started my own exploration in my areas of interest (19th and 20th century art), because by the time I returned to the Sainsbury wing I was too ""museumed-out"" to enjoy the earlier works. Next time!",Free valuable art 
"September 13, 2019","A slightly beyond medium sized art museum. It has representative paintings from different periods, showing at least 1 piece from the grand masters. It is not really comparable with other important European galleries, but it is free.",Good 
"September 12, 2019",We took the daily guided tour and found it to be very informative and pleasant. The staff were very helpful. We found that the gallery was easy to get to using public transport.. Would recommend this attraction to anyone visitors to London. ,One of this countries proper National treasures.
"September 11, 2019","One visit just isn’t enough. Pile as much cash as you can afford into the voluntary donation bins. It’s worth it to stare at the Wilton diptych, Santa Croce altarpiece, Virgin of the Rocks, Haywain...... the list goes on.Then spend all you have left in the shop. Support them. And take the kids. Places like this are how we escape.",World class art
"September 11, 2019",Revisited after 20years.Since visited galleries in many countries.This has to be amongst the best ( and free!)

"September 9, 2019",Wonderful museum. The building is as beautiful as the paintings! Great place to spend an afternoon. Would recommend.,Confused and crowded
"September 9, 2019",This is definitely not one of the great art galleries of the world. Layout is meandering. Too many madonnas from the Middle Ages. ,A must do!!!
"September 8, 2019","A phenomenalMuseum where you can see all the great artists! We were not disappointed and spent a great deal of time there. If you love art as we do, this is the place for you. Highly recommend!",Heaven for art lovers
"August 31, 2019","The architecture is impressive. Inside you can spend weeks if you want to look for each paintings. We most liked Van Gogh, Monet and Cezanne. I had high expections to the trafalgar square as its always mentioned in movies and news but to be honest there is nothing special.",Go in with a plan
"August 30, 2019","It's very crowded, especially with it's location right at Trafalgar Square. I think it would be a great idea to get a sense of what you want to see the most before going so you can hit those rooms first. Then once you have your must-see items out of the way you can wander around and enjoy the rest as your time allows.",Sorolla experience
"August 29, 2019",Wonderful ! Amazing gallery. Well worth the effort.Beautiful surroundings and exhibition. Gift shop is great too and had a lovely coffee afterwards upstairs l,Fantastic Art Museum

"August 27, 2019","Honestly such an incredible collection of artworks.  It was incredibly busy but we still managed to view all the great works of art and the facilities for baby changing and baby feeding are superb,  so really good for young children as well.",Great collection
"August 26, 2019","My first time visiting the National Gallery and I was really impressed with the early religious works, particularly some of the brilliant ultramarine works. It was also great to be able to see some of the modern works up close but this wing was pretty jammed with people. I love that it is a free museum but I hate the layout and some people seemed to have maps but I found myself continually trying to find one / figure out where we were.",Nice to see seven pillars
"August 26, 2019",I have been staying near to national gallery for nearly 2 months during my industrial training . I loved visiting here with my room mate and spend time on Saturday evenings ,Lovely Gallery
"August 25, 2019","This is a lovely gallery with great pieces worth seeing. Given the numerous entrances, it would be helpful to have maps available at each entrance. I was halfway through the gallery before I was able to get one. Also, the person standing right at the door asking for a donation is annoying. I actually would have given more if someone with an ipad wasn't there asking for it.  ",recommended
"August 17, 2019","Absolutely not to be missed, one of the best museums in the world, works by artists of the highest level, always very popular, but it is worth waiting to admire unique masterpieces. The distribution of a map at the entrance to the museum would be appreciated, which at least addresses the best works, there are indications in the various rooms, but it is more dispersive. Strongly recommended for a dip in the art of completely free.",A must when you visit London

"August 16, 2019","The art was amazing.  Unfortunately we didn't have nearly enough time to really look at everything, plus we had teens.  But we saw some awesome art, and it was free to enter (They ask for a donation).",Great for a rainy day
"August 16, 2019",The main part of the museum is free. It can become a little packed on wet days. But the gift shop is also worth a visit and the cafe sells delicious cakes. You have to pay to visit special exhibitions. Well worth a visit.,So much art to enjoy
"August 14, 2019","The breadth of art on show is stunning, this is a place that deserves repeat visits and the fact that the admission is free means that whether the visit is fleeting or longer it is unbelievable value. It does get busy another more well known pieces e.g. Van Gogh but it is possible to move at one’s own pace and find some awe inspiring pieces. It’s definitely one of my favourites. ",Wow!
"August 14, 2019",So many incredible paintings to see!  We wandered from gallery to gallery looking at just so many world famous paintings and best of all it's free entry!,Amazing collection of impressionists
"August 13, 2019",One of the best collections of impressionist painters. Here you can see some of the best works of best known artists.,A genuine national treasure

"August 12, 2019",Really enjoyed my second visit to the gallery and the cakes in the coffee shop are delicious! If you go there get there when it opens and go to the furthest room and work your way back to avoid the crowds as it’s hard to appreciate some larger pictures if too many people standing in front of them.,Wonderful
"July 21, 2019",It is another “must do” in London. Even if you do not know anything about art. It is wonderful and it is worth a lot.,A must visit.

For Free! No line - especially if you’re not carrying a backpack/bag that needs a security check. I wouldn’t recommend trying to see everything at once. There’s just too much great art. Pick a room or two to soak in, and plan to return. ",Adult culture without children!
"July 14, 2019","Normally any trip to a London includes the kids and kid friendly museums. This time we escaped and had a child free weekend. I’ve wanted to go to the National and wonder around for ages. It’s not that this is not child friendly- it is - but I wanted to spend me time looking at the art! Some amazing paintings and something for all. Loved the Monet’s, Turners, Cezanne’s and Renoir’s.

Next time it will be on the actual required program.  Room after room of masterpieces and artists you learned about in school and many that you should have learned about!  We spent 2 hours you could have spend 1/2 a day or if you were an art student 1 week or even 1 month.",Poor experience. Check restrictions on exhibitions first 
"July 5, 2019","Went to see Sorolla exhibition in lunchtime before it ends but refused entry as not a member. Nothing on website stipulating restrictions and nothing visible on entry into gallery prior to being told at the desk. Very poor. Don't get caught out. They had the audacity to ask if I'd be interested in a membership too. Error, of course, not.",Good quick visit
"July 5, 2019","The National Gallery has a wonderful collection of paintings.  We had just a couple hours before another event and it was a great way to spend that time.  We didn't see the whole museum,  but chose the collections we wanted to see.  The impressionist gallery was my favorite!",Stunning collection
"July 5, 2019","I would suggest that this gallery is a must if in London. The collection spans decades and is unhorsed in a beautiful building. The entry is free, as I believe all art and museums really should be. Art is an expression of who we are as a world.Don't miss this.",Truly an Amazing Place
"July 4, 2019","I have been going to the National Gallery since the 1980's, when I first started to work in London. I used to walk up to it in my lunch hour, from the City, escape into another world and ease away all the stresses of the working day. The painting are truly phenomenal. In an hour you can only see a very small part, you really need a full day - or two or three hours on consecutive days. It was here that I first really appreciated the works of Van Gogh. I remember standing in front of his 'A Wheatfield with Cypresses"". The vibrancy of the colours and the intensity of the brush stokes brought home what his pictures are truly about. But there is so, so much more. Turner's watercolours, Constables magnificent landscapes, Suerat, Cezanne, Gainsborough - the list is endless. And I haven't even mentioned Canaletto, in my opinion one of the best ever landscape painters. Best of all it's FREE, though you can make a donation if you choose. Make a day of it and have lunch in their cafe or dining room. It has brought me so much pleasure over the years, you really cannot help but have a super time there, even if you are not big into art. Check ou their super website before you visit to plan what you want to see. Thos is definitely one of life's MUST Do's.",Quite amazing and a must if you are in London
"July 3, 2019",I only had a short time for a visit so I went straight to the gallery containing the Impressionists.  Almost every painter of the period is represented. You cannot do justice to this fantastic gallery in a single visit so best to see on a number of occasions.  You can see some of the world's greatest paintings for free - take advantage of this opportunity!,Always such a pleasure to revisit 
"July 3, 2019","It always happens to me: National Gallery takes much more time than I originally plan. I started with the Renaissance painters, spent plenty of time enjoying my all time favorites, Leonardo’s “Virgin of the Rocks”, Botticelli’s “Venus and Mars” and his portraits. Moved on to amazing El Greco, phenomenal “Rokeby Venus” by Diego Velázquez, Van Eyck and Vermeer, several Rembrandt’s portraits, which I had seen on display recently in the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh... the list is very, very long, so I do not want to bore you with it... Around 2 pm the swarms of noisy school children have become unbearable, so I decided to take a break for lunch in the lovely National Gallery Cafe.After much needed lunch, I went to the Impressionists, the reason why I got stuck in the National Gallery for so long. What a stunning collection! The best Cezanne, Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, whom I adore... phenomenal Renoir’s portraits, beautiful Claude Monet’s landscapes, famous Manet’s paintings “The Music in the Tuileries” and “Execution of Maximilian”... I stopped paying attention to noisy school kids and completely drowned in the beauty of the paintings forgetting about everything around me. Forgot about time as well... it was already 6pm, the Gallery was closing. Will be back and hopefully soon.  ",Stunning Art
"July 2, 2019",National Gallery has stunning art work. I really enjoyed the portrait section. The museum is very large so review the map and see the sections you are interested first. Photos are allowed. There are benches in most rooms so you can sit and listen to the audio. They also have a coat room which comes in handy in the winter.,Must see
"July 2, 2019","Enjoyed seeing the art masterpiece thanks to a very helpful curator. He pointed out the must see masterpieces (Michelangelo, Da Vinci ,   and Monet) after he noticed we were walking around with no direction. Out of the three museums we went to this museum was my favourite.  FYI — Audio guide free with London Pass.  ",Nice Exhibits
"August 1, 2019",Was very surprised to see how well this exhibits are perfectly put together .Enjoyed admiring all the Artwork  ,"National Galery, London"
"July 30, 2019",London's National Gallery is a beautiful old structure with wonderful architecture. It is in Trafalgar Square and easy to find. The gallery itself is layed out beautifully and the collection of art is very good. They say it is free but they ask for a donation of at least £10.,Still wonderful
"July 30, 2019","I used to come here regularly on working trips to London but it has been at least a year since I was here last. Even if you only have a short time, it gives such a lift to go see some of the wonderful works in the permanent exhibition.",Busy
"July 26, 2019",Wanted to see certain paintings by Constable and Turner it was busy but we were directed to where they were and it was easy to find our way around. What can I say if art is your thing you can't go wrong here.,"Well organised, free and great art - and you can take photos"
"July 26, 2019","One of the greatest collections of art in the world and it's free - except for special exhibitions. Getting in is easy and smooth - I recommend getting in the queue early, or following the guidance on the website for the best times to visit. It is a VERY popular place.Also, it's good to plan your visit ahead, if you want to see anything special - and go there first.The corridors and galleries are wide, with quite a lot of seating, so you can take your time, and even if there are a lot of visitors, you can wait for a crowd to pass before viewing your favourite painting.A good/bad thing is that you can take photos. On the good side, this means you can take home your very own souvenirs and selfies with your favourites on camera. On the bad side, it means some people 'hog' the most famous paintings for ages while they try to get the 'perfect' shots, or cycle through their family/tour group.And of course there are the tour groups that stand in front of key paintings for 10-minutes while the guide gives the lecture, before the herd moves on. Patience is the key.I'd never been before this visit, so it was a good experience. Light halls and welcoming galleries make the place feel open and friendly.It's not as big as some around the world, but the quality of the paintings on display beats the quantity of other sites, in my opinion. And since it's free, you can't complain.Everything is clean and tidy, and quiet.You can get audio guides - I didn't use one, so can't comment.Depending on your level of interest in the different displays, 2-hours is probably enough to see almost everything - unless you're a serious art lover, or it's really crowded.I didn't eat there, so can't comment on the cafe. The shop is OK, with reasonable selection of of books, souvenirs, etc.Definitely worth a visit for a morning/afternoon, and since it's in Trafalgar Square it's easy to get to and combine with other central London activities.","If you love history and art, the National Gallery is a must."
"July 24, 2019",I had been to London twice before I ever went to the National Gallery. I din't now what I was missing. I spent hours perusing the gallery and saw some the most amazing works of art! A must see!,One of the world’s most important museums!

"June 3, 2019","I can't stress enough how great this museum is... and it's free.  If you ever took a class on the history of Western Art, you'll find a bunch of paintings here.  Bang a quick left when you head in and find The Ambassadors... stand to the right of the painting and the skull will emerge.  Plan on bringing comfortable shoes and allocate 2-3 hours.  Enjoy!",Well worth a visit
"June 3, 2019",Always a good place to visit particularly if the weather isn’t great. Works by all the famous artists you’ve heard of and many more.,Sorolla is a Must See
"June 2, 2019","My wife and I have been to the Sorolla Museum in Madrid several times and so were excited to see the artist's first exhibition in London since 1908. There is a very worthwhile introductory video and then numerous paintings sorted by subject matter or period. There are many examples from the Sorolla museum, the Prado, other Spanish museums as well as private collections. The artist was much admired during the early 20th century in Paris and America but never took off in the UK. There are many oversized canvasses of beach scenes, gardens and Spanierds in traditional costume. The expression of light and movement is genius and almost anyone will fall in love with this amazing artist that most people will not have heard of.","Mind Blowing!  A Must See when you visit London, England"
"June 1, 2019",There was a lot to see.  Bridget Riley's Messenger's painting was a delight to see.  Some of the older stuff like  Venus at her Mirror (The Rokeby Venus) by Diego Velázquez.  That is absolutely beautiful.,Great art

"May 27, 2019","Free admission to see Van Gough, Turner and other paintings was fantastic, the building itself is stunning.It’s bigger than you expect with lots to see and walk around.I must say it isn’t very well signposted so trying to find the artist/ room you are looking for can take a while, there doesn’t appear to be any order/ accurate signposting.It was quite busy with tourists pushing through doorways but this was a weekend so I guess that’s to be expected.The inside of the building is fabulous, the staff friendly, and the paintings fantastic.",National Gallery
"May 26, 2019",Something for everyone here.  Wonderful selection of art works by many different artists from all over the world.,Sorolla exhibition
"June 8, 2019",I always enjoy visiting here for both the free galleries & special exhibitions. The difference this time is I now use a wheelchair. Having prior experience meant I knew my way round & location of lifts. As always there is plenty to see. Staff were very helpful. I enjoyed the Sorolla exhibition. Some lifts are quite small. Disabled facilities are fine and help was given at the cafe to carry my food to a table.,Amazing art and artists
"June 7, 2019","After a day of sightseeing we headed to the National Gallery. We were tired and knew the visit would be rushed but this was our only chance. My husband is a wheelchair user and upon entering where we did, possibly not the main entrance, it wasn’t immediately clear where the main galleries were or what route we should take and no one to assist. We realised we’d need to go up the lift. Young ladies asking for donations once up and inside. I’d rather just pay a small entrance fee than it be free and be guilted into donating. Either way it’s massive value for money obviously, just a small annoyance. We didn’t see anywhere to get a map or assistance so started wandering through the nearest room. It’s a beautiful building inside and out, located on Trafalgar Square with lots of the usual food outlets around the square, lots of people and buzz. After wandering several rooms we got the hang of the flow and following the room numbers. We were totally gobsmacked. So many high quality artists and works all in one place. Hard to take in really, what we were seeing. Just incredible landscape, portrait and religious paintings, small and large. My husband drooling over all the Rembrandts and me just about everything else. Love that you can take photos, no flash. People were largely very accommodating allowing the wheelchair to move through the galleries and help with all the doors, and allowing room near the paintings. We could have spent half a day but had to keep a steady pace. So don’t let time out you off. It is doable in a few hours, just not preferable.",amazing art
"June 6, 2019","the gallery is near trafalgar square and entranceis free, u can enjoy 2 or three floors of great art, sometimes they do show contemporary art as well",Beautiful place!

"June 4, 2019","And therefore can be crowded so go early. Nicely laid out, easy to navigate, wonderful collection.

The organization is good, the lighting mostly fine.The only disappointment comes when a loved painting is out on tour :-(",Fantastic gallery to visit
"May 20, 2019","We were in London for a short break early in May, and spent a few hours in this wonderful gallery. It was very full and also very hot, really uncomfortably so . Luckily for foot weary visitors like us, there were comfy sofas to collapse into every now and again. We were very keen on seeing the two Vermeers and also the Jan Steens in the same room (Room 16). They were wonderful.  We also loved William Hogarth's satirical series Marriage -A-la-Mode (Room 35) and George Stubbs Whistlejacket - incredible painting of a race horse that hits you in the eye even before you enter the room. Another painting we saw that I won't forget was Elisabeth L. V. Le Brun's  ""Self portrait in a straw hat"", an 18C French painter. One doesn't see many female painters and she painted beautifully. A very interesting  few hours spent in the National Gallery.",amazing collection of works
"May 20, 2019",I love going to the National - the best place in London for anyone who adores art but doesn't have £100mil to buy their own collection  - amazing collection of works ,Impressionists and Vermeer

At the same time, there are many other paintings at the National Gallery!  I spent three and a half hours.  The Gallery overlooks Tralfagar Square.

"May 23, 2019",What can I say about this wonder? Art lovers will feel themselves in heaven and those who are simple admirers of architecture will be able to enjoy a cultural walk through the different periods of painting and sculpture made by the greatest artists in the world. And access is totally free! What more could you ask for?,Too much to see and so little time
"May 23, 2019","Entrance to the Gallery is free.  Most rooms have staff available that can answer visitors questions.  This time we decided to spend our time viewing just the Impressionists.  Other times we would go from room to room and eventually get ‘overloaded’ with the quality and quantity of art works.  The galleries have a very good representation of the Impressionist movement including works by Monet, Renoir, Degas and Cezanne.  I think next time a tour by one of the Gallery guides would be the best way to start the viewing of the gallery.",A magnificent  Ucello

"May 5, 2019","The Redhead loves a bank holiday weekend outing. She chose to go to this exhibition if an almost unknown (outside Spain) impressionist. The exhibition and Sorolla's work are simply amazing. Master of Light, certainly, but also of composition (cropping, diagonals) and most unusually empathy. His paintings of darker days in late C19th Spain (a raisin packing workshop, a woman who had murdered her baby) demonstrated that a painter who was later to be commissioned for society portraits and a whole wall in an American museum started with work of great humanity. Poignant, beautiful, skilled and utterly mind blowing.",Amazing time in national gallery
"May 5, 2019",I went to the National Gallery in May 2019 and when I was there there was a  Leonardo da VinciPainting on show there and I was amazed just to see that one photo there is no admission fee to enter the medium or they ask if you would like to make a donation to support the museum it would be very much appreciated but you can easily spend up to 4-5hours looking at art work in this place,Not to be missed.....
"May 4, 2019","Overlooking Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery holds the nation's main art masterpieces.

"February 24, 2019","I've been there before and loved it, but this was a first visit for my friend, who loves Turner. She was delighted to find a number   of his pictures among the gallery's enormous collection of wonderful pictures. We also liked a nearby room with an exhibit of some of the gallery's newest exhibits and Holbein's painting of ""The Ambassadors."".And we had rest, relaxation, and some nice nibbles in the restaurant in the Sainsbury wing of the gallery. Quite quiet and peaceful the afternoon we were there.Don't miss the gallery's main shop on the ground floor of the Sainsbury wing.

This, along with the illuminated shadows just in the right places (remarkable!), makes this a masterful creation. It's not easy to walk away from it.",Worth a Visit
"February 16, 2019","Well worth calling in if you are in the Trafalgar Square area. It's free but you should make a voluntary contribution at the various collection points. A lot of traditional paintings from artists such as Van Gogh, Botocelli, Di Vinci, Turner, Gainsborough etc.",National Gallery - Joy to the eyes

"December 13, 2018","This is possibly one of London’s most beautiful galleries! It had early works of Micheal Angelo on display as well as many others! The layout and division of art work is very pleasing as you walk through different eras and see the painting change in different centuries. It has a beautiful restaurant/café to sit and relax before you charge yourself to be on the move again, but the café can get busy sometimes.Also it’s free entry!

"December 5, 2019","A lover of fine arts who visits London never leaves without making an obligatory pilgrimage to the National Gallery.  One traverses Trafalgar Square with the keen anticipation of once again seeing ‘old friends’ – steadfast and almost always with new revelations to experience.  Most important, unlike the Louvre (where it seems most of the visitors are bent on seeing only the Mona Lisa), at this Gallery one does not ‘jostle’ with mindless tourists and one has the space to really study and appreciate the art on the walls.For us, it was marvellous to again gaze at Hans Holbein’s remarkable painting of Christina of Denmark (a bridal candidate for the widowed Henry VIII) who had reportedly posed for a mere 3 hours for this portrait.  Note her thrillingly expressive hands in front of her stiff mourning gown trimmed with fur.  Note her intelligent face. One wonders how English history might have been if she had become Henry’s wife. (Perhaps Thomas Cromwell would not have lost his head...)Here is Bronzino’s fantastic Allegory with its rosily nude Venus and dimpled Cupid flanked by various figures, either very young and joyful or very old and angry looking.Here is Van Eyck’s painting of a married couple named Arnolfini, the wife heavily pregnant who looks lovingly at her husband, but who is turned away from her and is seemingly blind; one ponders on the small dog and clumsily arranged slippers in the foreground and the mirror in the background.And one is again rather disappointed that Turner’s Fighting Temeraire is not painted on a huge canvas!  But to see first-hand this master’s use of light and colour is an unforgettable experience. Note: a few galleries were being renovated during our visit and this was not noted in the otherwise very useful map, so one had to ask a guard and go through several corridors to see Vermeer’s intimate paintings.",Not a great art lover but....
"December 4, 2019","I'm not a great art lover, but even I have to gaze in admiration at paintings by Constable, Gainsborough, Manet, Monet, Van Gogh, Vermeer, Claude, Turner, etc... My wife was surprised by how much I enjoyed our visit.",Stunning...and exhausting
"December 4, 2019","One masterpiece after another. What a great assemblage of European art.  I wasn't sure how long I'd be there so I didn't get an audio guide, but even wandering around haphazardly for 2 hours, I was blown away and trying to find time on my schedule to go back. My suggestion is spend lots of time there, do some research and make a plan before you go.",Wish we had more time
"December 4, 2019","Fantastic visit! You need to put aside at the least 3 hours if you want to see the highlights, however, it's easily a 4-6 hour day.  We only had certain time allotted for the visit, so we tried to limit ourselves to the highlights.  We kept getting distracted by other beautiful pieces of art, making our visit a little longer than the 2 hours we had planned.  It was all good fun though and I wouldn't have had it any other way.",Great visit
"December 4, 2019",A must see. Everything here is a piece of history. Absolutely worth the visit. Lot of people in the week-end!,Quick lunch
"December 3, 2019",busy when we visited last week. Food was tasty but portions not huge. Cakes looked delicious . Tables are very close together,Interesting place
"December 3, 2019",I don't usually go to a Gallery museum. But this one is probably the one to go if someone wants a nice first time experience in a gallery.,"One of my favorite places, and it's free!"
"October 5, 2018","You can spend hours and hours here looking at great masterpieces, but my favorites are the Impressionists from the later 1800s, such as Monet, Renoir, Cezanne, and Degas.Right outside, there's Trafalgar Square and buzzing humanity to entertain you!",Incredible visit
"October 4, 2018","We lined up about 45 minutes before opening - were among the first few in the front of the line to brave the rain that morning. It was well well worth it. I recommend getting in line well before opening. Even though there were many people visiting that day it did not feel overcrowded. Skip the restaurant - the service is very slow and the coffee was just ok - and the hot chocolate was not the best. But alas, we were not there for the food or drink anyhow.",Accessible Public Art
"October 4, 2018",The gift of Art that keeps on giving. Curated in a manner that always amazes and ensures you want to come back again. ,Great Saturday at the National Gallery
"October 3, 2018",A great way to spend a Saturday. The National Gallery offers art to please most art lovers. And entry is free.,We had an outstanding docent tour
"October 3, 2018","We went on a docent tour led by Helen.  I have been on many docent tours over the years, and she is one of the best.  Besides being very knowledgeable, and easily able to shift to another work of art when one is too crowded by other groups, she was amusing, entertaining and engaging.The museum is outstanding, but it's difficult (for me) to know where to start on where to focus without a tour.",Great art

"October 15, 2018","We went to the museum on Friday night when it is open late.  To be honest the place was not lighted very well for an evening visit,  We had to use our lights on our phones to read the displays and it was very dark in the large rooms.  Seeing the Rosetta Stone was a highlight and the Greek rooms were great, what we could see of them.  The place is huge, so if you have limited time you really need to cherry pick things to see,",Beautiful Museum
"October 15, 2018",The collection at this museum is wonderful.  Just wish the Caravaggio room hadn't been closed during our visit.  That was the only letdown.  ,Beautiful collection of paintings covering the history of painting from more or 14th -19th century.
"October 14, 2018","I have been at the national gallery many times and always find it inspiring and discover new things. It has a nice collection on impressionists and also of Dutch Masters. I also love the collections of Iconic paintings. Because of it's central location you can also walk in and out just for 30 min or so.

"September 2, 2018","So many wonderful paintibgs and quite easy to get around. I am past the age of going to very big museums such as Louvre or Prado or National Gallery, but enjoyed this time. It is also nice that it is in the very centre so you can stop when tured and come back next time bus passes through Trafalgar square.",Beautiful Place 
"September 2, 2018","Paintings are huged and it was difficult to pay attention to all of them but not quite sure this could be for very young children, as not easy to calm them.",Great
"September 2, 2018","Fantastic place, loved what we saw. Loved that it was free and loved the ambience. Would visit again!",Visit to galleries
"December 3, 2019","Beautiful setting especially at Christmas The collection is unique and it is well-run. There are stalls outside, giving a great visual effect and there are so many things to do and see at the gallery. Good, well-stocked shop.",Some of the World's Greatest Art for Free Entry!
"December 2, 2019","This gallery never ceases to amaze me.

The staff are incredibly knowledgeable and helpful and are located throughout the gallery. The amazing part is that there is no fee for entry - but please donate on your way in!",A really good experience
"December 2, 2019","Always a good place to catch a good Exhibition of one of your favourite Artists.  Well set out, beautifully lit, usually not too crowded so you can get up close and personal with the paintings.  I was lucky enough to catch the Gaugain portrait exhibition this week and was delighted with it...  posters and prints were available as well a nice souvenir to take home.  There is a new cafe Bar  now in the Sainsbury’s Wing and was very good.  Good choice, nice prices, well worth staying for a lunch.There are of course many Rooms filled with wonderful Paintings but the special visiting Artists are always worth making a special trip to see them when they come round.  Lifts are around for different floors and usually someone to ask if you get lost, it’s a huge place.","So many famous artists: Turner, Constable, Manet............"
"December 2, 2019","Allow plenty of time - there's lots to see in what is probably the UK's No 1 art gallery. So many famous artists: Turner, Constable, Manet............",well worth a visit
"December 2, 2019",another place well worth a visit when on a budget. Check out the museum and gallerys and there are always nice coffe shops for you to chill out in between walking around :),To the Sackler Gallery!
"December 2, 2019","You could spent your entire holiday here- and it would be time well spent.For those with of you with limited time, ask a member of staff to direct you toward the Sackler gallery, the space which houses some of the most famous British art, such as JMW Turner’s ‘Fighting Temeraire’.",Leonardo Exhibit is one to miss
"December 2, 2019","I entered the National Gallery, which is ordinarily gratis thanks to UK taxpayers, and paid an extra GBP 18.00 for “Leonardo,” what I thought was a special exhibit of Leonardo da Vinci’s works. Instead the “Leonardo” exhibit is a kindergarten tour of manufactured perspectives and views Leonardo “might” have seen, capped by a single image. What a scam. The National Gallery should not stoop so low, dumbing down art and manufacturing hype, just to raise a few extra bucks. Skip this bogus paid extra and instead tour the other halls full of real masterpieces for free. ",Well worth the visit
"December 2, 2019","Spent a few hours in there one morning, plenty to look at and if you download their app you can take photographs of paintings with an explanation given about them. Shop and cafe there too, all in all a worthwhile and enjoyable experience.","So much to see, so little time..."

"July 21, 2018","An incredible catalogue of masterpieces from 13th to 20th century. It’s probably too much to visit in one day, we’ll be back again next trip to a London.It is recommended to get the audio guide (10 £ family package for 4) that will give detailed info on each painting. Photos are allowed, with no flash and no selfie stick. Most crowded area was the impressionists and Van Gogh rooms. ","Brilliant, free, not to be missed"
"July 20, 2018","Make sure you go into the Turner, Constable, Gainsborough room. Three of England's great artists in one fabulous room. What a glorious place. And it's free. Amazing. Well, done London, you show the world how it should be done.",Covent Garden

"July 18, 2018",Have not been in for a long time and was so glad I visited. The treasures to look at... and available to take snaps of.. really made the trip worthwhile. Stunning... ,Excellent collection
"July 17, 2018",This is a less popular museum compare to the British Museum.  So go here if you are trying to avoid the crowd like I did.  It was a no stress and delightful visit.  The collection is extensive enough to take up at least half a day.  The neighborhood is very lively with a lot of bars and cafe.,Well worth a trip
"July 11, 2018","good cultural explosion, not overly crowded, decently priced and a lot of variety. Would definitely recommend for a couple's afternoon trip.",Awful cafe experience
"June 2, 2018","Poor customer service, the staff standing in the way of food and talking to each other not serving while you stood waiting. Food was bland and unpleasant, which after the process and the wait was kick in the teeth.",A must see
"June 1, 2018","We visited this museum and the exhibits were so wonderful, I especially loved Van Goghs paintings of the crabs",You must go!
"May 31, 2018",To stand in front of some of the most famous and beautiful paintings ever created is a thrill I will not soon forget. Magnificent building.  The gift shop has some wonderful prints of some of the more iconic paintings and a very good price.,Always inspiring
"May 28, 2018","To be face to canvas with art work done by names of historical significance is awe inspiring. Having never been an art lover, I've become a National Gallery addict. The shop and display next door is also a worthwhile venture. The newly renovated cafe downstairs no longer serves scones but has a nice atmosphere. Food was good and after a half day of walking a welcome break. I tried the ""Fish Pie""... tasty. Something here has drawn me back 7 times.",Numerous visits
"May 28, 2018","What a fantastic gallery to visit. It is huge and I have spent several happy afternoons wandering through the various sections.  The works of art are magnificent and should not be rushed, hence the need for many visits. Entry is free, but there is a donation box for the upkeep. ",One of the most amazing experience in my life

"May 24, 2018",A free museum that was easy to get to and had some of the greatest and amazing art work from around the world. ,MOST WONDERFUL DISPLAY OF ART
"May 23, 2018",The magnificent display from the works of so many masters was a joy to behold..Turners works were magnificent as was Gainsborough...visitors to London should have it on their MUST SEE list.,Free! - and great
"May 21, 2018","Located directly at Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery is perfect even for the not-so-artsy spirit, because it’s free to visit and you can check out only a coupleof paintings and spend 10 minutes there, or hang out the whole day surrounded by some of the world’s most famous artists. Right now (May 2018) they have one copy of van Gogh’s Sunflowers there (2nd floor, room 43), which by itself is worth the visit. It is surrounded by other impressionists that deserve equal attention, though, so it makes for a very rewarding visit. ",Artistic Majesty
"May 21, 2018",Three centuries of Royal and aristocratic collecting are on display at this magnificent and free museum. I always make a beeline for the 17th century Dutch collection but no matter your preferences there is something for every taste.,The national gallery
"March 11, 2018",An excellent collection of impressionist and post impressionist art as well as international art that is done by the masters of their kind. An excellent collection which failed to disappoint. Expect to spend a full day here and don't hesitate because it is well worth it.,Heaven for art lovers
"March 7, 2018","Sitting at the top end of the Trafalgar Square, National Gallery is a grand, elegant and massive art gallery. National Gallery was formed in 1824 and it started when the British Government bought 38 paintings from an insurance broker. Today it houses of 2,300 paintings dated from 13th century to 20th century. Two third of the collections are from private donations. I came here on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't very busy. I had made a list of paintings which I wanted to see and with the help of an audio guide (£5), it made my visit absolutely rewarding. My most favourite artist is Canaletto due to my love of Venice, but National Gallery also displays many famous artists' paintings such as from John Constable, Joseph Turner, Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, Claude, Rembrandt, Michelangeio, Titian and Leonardo da Vinci...etc. All paintings are displayed on one floor but it was spread over 60 rooms and it is huge. I spent 4 hours at the gallery and still didn't feel enough. National Gallery houses one of the best collections of paintings in the world and it is free. This is a MUST visit gallery if you fancy art and paintings. Highly recommended!Tips: i) The information leaflet that comes with the audio is awful. Its map is unclear and the whole thing is in black and white. Spend £2 & get a proper map if you can afford it.ii) Avoid the National Cafe inside the gallery. It's a tourist trap and is overpriced, even its signature dish (i.e. cakes/ scones) is well below average. There are many good cafes at Leicester Square and Covent Garden so don't waste your money here.iii) There are few electric sockets at the Central Hall (level 2) which can be used to recharge your mobile's battery.",a proper place to find your soul
"March 5, 2018",leave plenty of time and step back in history this is a visit where you need to browse and take in all the generations. We wont have the late centuries ever captured like this again and its a lovely place to visit with knowledgeable staff and a timeless visit.BC,Love this museum
"March 3, 2018","Amazing, and so interesting And it’s free!!! But please donate , (so it will always be there) I could walk and view for days here .  Plan at least 3 hours to see some of it.Lovely.",Awesome exhibits
"February 21, 2018",This is a wonderful museum to spend an hour or so in while soaking up some English culture. Amazing that museums like this are free. Very educational and pleasing.,A Must See in London
"February 17, 2018","We only had six hours in London and didn't have a plan for the day we were just going to see were we ended up. The rain was pouring down and we were freezing as we found our way to Trafalgar Square, so we decided to pop in here to get out of the cold. Its free to enter, but donations are welcome. There are guided tours if you have the time, unfortunately for our party we only spent an hour here, but we will definitely be back. Its great to see budding artists sitting copying the masterpieces. With limited time we decided there was one painting we had to see before we left, Van Gogh's Sunflowers. It was easy to find as there was a big crowd gathered around it. All in all too short a visit.",First Visit to the National Gallery
"February 15, 2018","My husband and I visited the National Gallery for the first time a few days ago. It is free but you are encouraged to make a donation. We both really enjoyed it. It was certainly busy, but not so much that you couldn’t stand and appreciate the amazing artwork on display. We particularly loved seeing work by Degas, Monet, Van Gogh and Cezanne to name a few. We spend around 90 minutes at the Gallery, but we would recommend to stay longer if you can . ",Free entry to incredible art!
"February 12, 2018","The best thing about the National Gallery is the art. The range and the artists on display are quite incredible. The second best thing is that it is FREE! On easy-to-access Trafalgar square, this museum is one of my favourites in London. I particularly love the Impressionists, but their collection of paintings by Turner, Da Vinci and a slew of other famous, and less famous artists are well worth the visit.There is a great coffee shop downstairs where you can relax during, before or after your visit.",Girlie 50th Birthday Celebrations!
"February 2, 2018",Lovely to walk around and while away the hours. As a non artist I found it very interesting and even if you are not into art you have to admire the work there. Well worth a visit.,Interesting but somewhat dull 
"January 28, 2018","The gallery itself is very well kept and thoroughly cleaned. There are a large number of paintings here, though I think that they can only be appreciated by true art buffs. As a possible improvement, I think it could be better if the staff in each of the rooms actively interacted with the public - such as by providing information about the paintings. Other galleries I have been to have been far more interactive and interesting. ",National Faffery
"August 9, 2017","Overcrowded with selfie takers.  Bag check queue, ok fair enough but then to have to queue up for a second bag check after we'd been to the cafe is ridiculous.  Avoid except early in the morning",JMW Turner
"August 8, 2017","Wanted to see The Fighting Temeraire by Turner. Wonderful painting, saw lots more too. There is no entrance fee, surprisingly but they ask for a £5 donation which is reasonable when you consider the number of wonderful paintings and the upkeep of the building.",National Gallery
"August 7, 2017",We enjoyed walking around the National Gallery and looking at the amazing artwork. The street performers out front were cool too. I recommend picking up the guide to help you get around. ,Gorgeous
"July 31, 2017",I go to National Gallery regularly and always stop at the entrance hall to admire the beauty of the ceilings and the staircase.There are frequent exhibitions but it's worth to go and look at the permanent pieces.,Chris Ofili's Tapestries
"July 27, 2017","Grayson Perry's doing them, an now another male artist tackles large scale tapestry.The story is well told, with a special installation of preparatory drawings and the finished piece in a muralled room. The work is technically challenging, pushing the craft to another level managing to imitate watercolor with wool.Of course other treasures in the gallery include: impressionist 'greatest hits', Flemish, Dutch and Southern European masters, including a current comparative exhibition of Rembrandt and contemporaries, and of course early Renaissance work. One of the most interesting galleries is the ""gallery A"" in the basement at Orange Street entrance end. It's a hotch-potch of periods of work deemed second rate! (Academy & 'school of...) You can get up a little closer and they are hung closer and in a much more comparative manner.",Don't miss this amazing art gallery
"July 26, 2017",A wonderful range of incredible paintings representing different periods. It is also a beautiful building and not to be missed.,All the big names
"July 26, 2017","If you have some spare time in London, just jump in for a glance at some of the biggest names in painting and more. And it's free!",Fantastic

"July 12, 2017","If you see nothing else in this iconic building, spend some time looking at Leonardo's Maddona of the Rocks. This transcendental and life affirming work will lift your heart and refresh your spirit. The gallery is a treasure house of art from the National collection. Get there early to avoid the crowds.",Varied collection of top artists
"July 11, 2017","The National Gallery has an impressive art collection from the 12th to the early 20th Century, well presented in lovely rooms and with clear explanations.  There is a room (quite large) dedicated to the English painters, Constable, Gainsborough, Turner, Reynolds, Stubbs.  The french impressionists are well represented, with Cezanne, Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Seurat, Degas and Renoir among others.  There was a special exhibition of Rembrandt and Rubens.  Lots of others, too many to mention.  An art lovers feast. ",The Immortal Leonardo Da Vinci
"December 5, 2017","National Gallery in London is one of the most beautiful treasures of the mankind where you can see remarkable paintings from the Early Renaissance to the French Impressionists.  Whenever I go to London, I always take several hours to re-visit it or  at least to see again two of Leonardo's Masterpieces, The Virgin of the Rocks and The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist.  I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that after many years, The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist.was moved to a better place in the Gallery where the value of this fantastic drawing is so well highlighted .  If you go there, take a close look at the face of The Virgin.  You have never seen anything like that, the Beauty and the Joy of the Virgin, while looking with motherly love at  the baby Christ and baby John the Baptist.Do not be concerned about costs because THERE IS NO ENTRANCE FEE",Awesome!
"November 15, 2017","It's one of the best art galleries in the world in my opinion. The works range from early medieval up to the turn of the 20th century. Some real stand out pieces here from all the major artists. It is very large, with lots of rooms, but the paintings are well spaced out. It's got a good cloakroom £1.50 per item, plus a nice restaurant to have a snack or cuppa. They also do free 1 hour tours which I did today - lots of good info about the building and some of the key paintings. Lovely large art book shop too. Oh yes, it's free entry too. 600 years of great art for free!",George Stubbs Visit
"November 14, 2017","Reception told me where George Stubbs ""Whistle Jacket"" was, and I was off. Husband couldn't keep up with me. I was determined to see that painting before all others. It's positioning in the gallery on the 3rd floor, allowed me to see it from afar, and I couldn't move fast enough. I traveled thousands of miles and decades of my life to finally see Whistle Jacket in person. As I was only 2 half glass doors away, I broke into sobs - I'm sure the security folks thought me strange, but I was here. Finally! That painting was mine to admire for as long as I wanted....For FREE!From this George Stubbs fan who came to this museum for only 1 painting - It is a must see, even if you aren't an art fan. Just saying to your grandchildren you saw ""Sunflowers"" in person is a epic.Please enjoy all this museum has to offer. Even my husband was moved by a painting or two, and I never thought that would happen. ",great visit

"November 6, 2017","It is a lovely and a place full of art. If you have a spare day I would recommend going there to fill yourself with a magic of art. It is quite a large museum, would probably take you around 3 hours if quick look through each painting :) I've been there few times already and I would go again :)",Must see
"November 4, 2017","The free entry in London Museums is a great idea to give everyone the opportunity to see and appreciate art. It's not common in other places, so I think that leave an offer it's the correct response. The collection is stunning, Monet, Van Gogh ( one of his famous Sunflowers ) Renoir, Seurat, Turner, Rubens, Raffaello, Tiziano, Leonardo (La Vergine delle Rocce) Michelangelo, Guercino... count at least 3 hours to visit the most important master pieces. The buildings is also interesting ti see, if you go to London you have to stop here.",Big group - a few youngsters and adults
"November 1, 2017","Was a great time but A LOT of walking. Was exhausted after but the teenagers all enjoyed themselves. A lot to see, something for all ages.I would say a 'must see' for tourists and Londoners alike.",Awesome Experience That Was Not Expecting
"October 26, 2017",We are not Art experts nor do we usually go out of our way to visit Art Museums anywhere. We were wandering the area and noticed it was still open (Friday night I believe). So we stumbled on in and then didn't want to leave. Very impressive displays and paintings by renowned artists. Awesome building and free to get in. Now that I have seen it I will make a point to visit more Art Museums while I continue to travel the globe. It is worth the time to drop in and enjoy this fine Gallery. ,Fabulous place !
"October 13, 2017","We have visited the National Gallery many times but there is so much to see that every visit is like the first time and new.This gallery has a fabulous selection of works from the greatest artists who have ever lived . If you love art a visit is a must.This visit was to see a specific exhibition ...

"October 10, 2017","We only spent hour or so in the National gallery before heading off for a West End show. I've often visited in the past, but had forgotten just how many famous paintings are on display, including works by Monet, Renoir, Constable, Van Gogh and Stubbs. Bearing in mind that there is no compulsory charge, this is a great way to pass some quality time in London.",Lots of portraits
"November 1, 2019",If you are into seeing portraits of the British aristocracy this is the place.  We went for the pre Raphaelite Sister exhibit which was fascinating.  I’m not sure I would have enjoyed the visit as much with out that and Konica at the Portrait Restaurant.,A piece of our culture
"November 1, 2019",You cannot miss it if you like the culture and the history of European art. Excellent exposition to visit also with family.,"Great free museum, with plenty to see"

"October 31, 2019","Classic museum experience. I was especially pleased by the openness and lightness.  Of course, filled with people, but I never experienced the crowded feeling.

"October 31, 2019","I was at the place yesterday, there were a lot of people. But the art was abnormally amazing with many different artists and styles. This is a must if you have the roads past London.  It was free for everyone, which allows you to go in and take a quick look if you don't have that much time.  Good informative staff, but the guards looked angry and dazzled at one.",A treat for the eyes!

"November 14, 2016","I spent about 1.5 hours walking through the National Gallery. I was surprised that it isn't a larger museum, but this actually made the visit feel more leisurely. I walked through almost the entire place. The Turner paintings and the Van Gogh works were incredible. The work is beautifully presented in many smaller sized galleries and the map clearly shows how to navigate. The book shop had some wonderful books and a spot to sit down. The building itself is lovely and showcases an amazing collection of art. ",Beautiful building housing some of the classics
"July 16, 2016","Even if you're not interested in art you can't deny that the National Gallery is a phenomenal building (it's worth visiting for this alone!). When I visited a number of the galleries were under renovation which was a little disappointing however there were still so many wonderful paintings (mainly) to take in, including works by Van Gogh, Monet and Manet. It's definitely worth a visit if you're a fan of traditional painters.",Incredible!
"July 16, 2016",My family and I walked around this part of the city in the rain before visiting the National Gallery.  We spent about two hours and could have spent the whole day.  We got the audio guides.  I would get them if you plan to visit a long time.  We were there for a short time and it is impossible to absorb everything.  I had a great couple if hours just looking.  My children liked it too even though they know little about art. We are planning on going back during this trip as admission is free and there was so much to see.,Wonderful place to wander!
"July 13, 2016",The National Gallery is amazing!  It is free admission and I highly recommend the audio headsets 3£....you can spend as little or as much time as you care to in this beautiful Art Gallery.

"July 7, 2016","For an art museum to give you full satisfactory, you need to be a fan and you need to have time. A museum full of paintings from different eras and very different artists who each have their story to tell, requires peace, calming music from certain ages, a professional guide and will to focus. For me it was more like running through this huge museum with millions of people screaming and shouting, being lost and not really into it, if you know what i mean. So go early, if you're a fan, take a guided tour, though the visit itself is free. It's a lovely museum, the atmosphere simply needs to be created.",Never gets old
"July 5, 2016",I will never tire of visiting here. I go every year when I can. There are some real treasures. Going with a free guide is something that will add to the experience.,Wonderful gallery
"June 27, 2016",The National Gallery is light and airy which makes it far more pleasant to wonder around than some other galleries. I regularly take groups of Primary school children there and would highly recommend their guided tours. Three paintings are chosen to focus on and the guides are both very knowledgeable and child centred. A great first introduction to art appreciation.,a Must in London
"June 27, 2016","You cannot miss one visit at least to this fantastic Gallery. The Museum overlooking Trafalgar Square, houses an incredible collection of gorgeous paintings and astonishing works of art (mostly of Italian origin!) dating back from the 13th to the 19th century all of them perfectly kept and wonderfully displayed in the wide halls of an eighteenth century building. All of that FREE OF CHARGE. One more tip: once there, don' forget to drop in the delicious Cafè downstairs... ",Excellent Museum
"June 15, 2016","It's gigantic,  and filled with so many notable works of art that it can be overwhelming. If you have the luxury of time, I suggest you do it in segments.  If not, just go for it. The cafe is a must-see for its lavish rooms, but beware. It's difficult to find a seat. The people working there are multi-national, and most are quite helpful and knowledgeable. Our family did the National Portrait Gallery,  lunch and a concert at St. Martin in the Fields, and the National Gallery, as well as hanging out in Trafalgar Square, all in one long day (Friday, when the gallery is open late.) It's a long day, but your mind will be full and your eyes tired at the end of it. ",Audio guide- a must

"November 10, 2016","National Gallery should be on the top of anyone's list. I have been to London several times, but I always make time for a visit to Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery.Over 2300 images to view including  iconic masterpieces by Cezanne, Monet, Seurat, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, and too many others to mention. Pick up a museum map, and if you have the time to spend, a portable Audio Guide with commentaries on more than 1,000 of the paintings.",Wonderful
"November 9, 2016","You need to set aside plenty of time for this wonderful collection.We purchased the headphones something I would highly recommendThe staff are very helpful and thankfully act very quickly when people disrespect the principles governing conduct, safeguarding the exhibits.Would definitely recommend The National Gallery",Beautiful museum 
"November 6, 2016","My second favourite museum in London. Vast collection, Pieces of the greatest painters in history. Well planned and organized. I really enjoy it. A little bit crowded on the weekends. ",Need at least full day to see it all.
"October 29, 2016","What can I say. For everyone who has even a little knowledge of art visiting National Gallery is a big thing. I am not a specialist in art, however I spent there almost full day being amazed with all paintings I found. Free entrance.",Must see 
"October 20, 2016","We visited the Caravaggio exposition. Best to watch the  15 min video before the paintings, this gives some nice background to appreciate the paintings even more. The actual Caravaggio paintings are few though",Great and amazing if you like art.
"October 18, 2016","Got to see great works of art from different timeperiods. From renaiscance work of arts to Monet, Degas and Van Goh",visit to gallery
"October 18, 2016",We took a tour at 11.30 yesterday and the gentleman who conducted the tour was very knowledgeable. Definitely go back ,Rainy day?  No problem!
"October 16, 2016","What a beautiful gallery.  The rooms are well lit and spacious so the art is given room to glow.  There were many people there but we really didn't have to wait more than a few seconds to see anything.  Many of the rooms had comfortable seating, to encourage contemplation of the works within but also to enable visitors to sit quietly and rest.  We only had an afternoon and barely scratched the surface of all there was to see, but to able to be that close to paintings by Rembrandt, Klimt, Van Gogh, Renoir, etc. was humbling and inspiring.  ALSO the descriptions that accompanied each painting were informative and fun to read. Finally, there were many fun souvenir options in the gift store to take back home.  So count on spending a bit of time there!",Painters Paintings
"August 25, 2016","This interesting exhibit is closing soon, so hustle to see it.  The title may confuse, but it is an exhibit of the painting that famous painters thought enough of to purchase for their own collections, and hang in their homes and offices.  Unsurprisingly, they mostly chose work, similar to their own.  I was a little disappointed that Claude Monet was not included as he was a fan of Japanese painting.",Excellent
"August 23, 2016","the museum is wonderful, the only problem is that you can not see a picture would silently because of some tourists who speak loudly. There are many works and the building itself to be admired.",Brilliant and FREE !
"August 18, 2016","Best museum to visit for me at this houses Joseph Wright of Derby's Experiment with a bird and an air pump. Genius use of light, perspective and symbolism.  Usually go for a viewing every few months as it's so special to me.  Next door, round the corner is the National Portrait gallery, and you would be foolish to miss this equally superb exhibition space. Top Marks A*",Very attractive building

"July 28, 2016","If you are into paintings, this is a place for you. And if you aren't, it's still worth it to check it out. If you are interested in studying various paintings, make sure to take part in the tours offered by museum. ",One of London's Gems
"July 27, 2016","One of the best collections of art, from across the ages, and all for free. Each room is so rich in its treasures that you could probably spend an entire week going around it and still not take in every room and every piece in the collection. I don't think that there is any gallery in the world that can match the quality and diversity of the collection for free. The National Gallery is surely one of the places that helps to make London such a popular destination for tourists.",David Hockney Exhibition
"July 26, 2016","This is a simple and short review. If you are in London don't miss this exhibition.  These are not portraits. These are David Hockney portraits and they are riveting. You find yourself viewing the 82 portraits and then viewing them again, spending time on each one of them as if they just won't release you. Don't miss it and remember to pre-order tickets on-line because they are fully booked.",Perfect spot on a rainy day or any day
"July 25, 2016",Fantastic gallery of impressive paintings! Take advantage of the free tours offered and take a deeper look into different paintings and what the artist was trying to convey. ,Get In There and Spot Your Drinks Coaster
"July 20, 2016","The thing with everyday life, is, you are surrounded by the great arts. You are getting Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Turner, Da Vinci and Matisse, all day, every day.So: for the majority of people who think 'culture and arts' are for the posh and the brainy - you're wrong. Wherever you are right now, reading this, there is probably a picture or tune, very nearby, which is a classic.Many of your favourite TV ads use classical music. Bach's Air on a G string and Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata are daily fodder.It is likely that you have some Van Gogh flowers or corn fields or Constable's hay wain on your coasters. There's bound to be a Gainsborough horse or two on the pub wall.My point is that you should go along to the National Gallery and take a look at these great pictures for yourself. You'll find it fascinating, seeing all of these familiar pics in real life.A lot of people think you have to go to The Louvre to see the greatest art on the planet. Wrong. The National has more greats that any other national collection. How come?Because when we had an empire, we went gaily around, from country to country, continent to continent and acquired all of the good stuff.The National Gallery, right there on Trafalgar Square is also one of the most familiar buildings on telly. Everyone recognises it, even if they're not sure what it is. If you're in the West End, nip down the road, south, from Leicester Square and you're there in a jiffy.If you're around central London for any reason or even the shortest time, please do go in. It's free.There's no pressure. And . . . you already know a lot of the fine works.The layout is great. It starts with the old stuff and gets more modern as you walk along.Having persuaded you to pop in, if you're not madly arty, then follow the main collection through to the right, all the way to the end.Here are the 18th - 20th century paintings. A lot of which you already know and love.Now as you wander back, you are going back in time. You can skip whole centuries if you like.I like the really old stuff. Pretty gruesome some of it with torture and murder all over the place.Now as you go about, you'll be able to say ""I saw that in the National Gallery"". I saw that in the National Gallery, too"".And on so many TV news items - ""There's the National Gallery. I've been in there. It's great"".",The clue is in the title 'Beyond' Caravaggio!!!
"January 2, 2017","I usually very much enjoy National Gallery exhibitions - we are members and visit often. However the current Caravaggio exhibition is a disgrace in my view. You cannot market such an exhibition with only 6 pictures by the named artist!! It's not that the others are not good, they are, especially the Riberas but it's really shocking that so much is made of the influence of Caravaggio with so few examples. Come on NG, you're taking the pxxx!!Spend your money instead in the small 'jewel ' of the exhibition that is the Australian Impressionists - an eye opening feast for the eyes!!",great way to pass the time
"December 29, 2016","We did a tour of the gallery , great works of European art. The range was beautiful and well presented, well documented. More in depth with an audio tour. The symbolism in the artwork is astounding.",Excellent Museum With Some of the Most Famous Paintings in the World
"December 26, 2016","This is an excellent art museum in the heart of London. It's a great spot if you don't have a ton of time in London because you can also check off Trafalgar Square and the National Portrait Gallery. I adored the National Gallery. Amazingly it's free to get in! You don't see that much these days. It can be crowded so be prepared for the crowds (or go early).There are a LOT of important paintings including Van Gogh's ""Sunflowers,"" and works by Jan van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Hans Holbein, J. M. W. Turner, and many many more. I highly recommend it.",Beautiful Place
"December 17, 2016","Amazing place that I've been visited! I loved the structure of the building and the amazing view, I'll visit that place again for sure. Next year I'm planning to visit that place again. Love Love Love ",More Caravaggio please
"November 26, 2016","I visited the current exhibtion centring on the work and influence of Caravaggio. The exhibition was well laid out and well presented. However, it would have been strengthened by more works by Caravaggio himself. The two key exhibits, beautifully set out side-by-side already belong to the National Gallery. I am London-based, but I wonder if someone travelling to the city specifically for this event would have felt it was rather slight, or light on major works. It compares poorly with some of the great exhibitions such as the Leonardo da Vinci  and the Rembrandt which the Gallery has achieved in recent times","Great art, centrally locsted"
"November 25, 2016",The national gallery is at a prime location of the Trafalgar Square. The gallery is huge and has lot of different variety of art from basic abstract to mixtures. The building is great and the guide program for the gallery is very useful and give an great idea of all the art displayed in the Gallery ,A Must See
"November 22, 2016","The National Gallery is among some of the best galleries in Europe.  We went on a Friday evening and definitely less crowded.  There were a lot to see and we saw about 75% of the paintings.  By the end, we were exhausted.  Next time I'm in London, would definitely go again.",Carravagio & Beyond exhibit was wonderful

Great exhibits but extremely crowded and noisy. I could not possibly have seen all the paintings and was so bothered by noise. I wish I could enjoy the arts with less crowds, creating better experience.  Maybe next time.","Goya, the man and his paintings"
"October 14, 2015","Before the exhibition, I did not know very much about Goya and his pictures, usually French and Italian paintings/artists were what interested me but Goya's works were wonderful. The guide book given is very helpful but do not miss out on having the audio guide.  Not only was there information regarding the pictures, life and times Goya lived through but further information on the costumes and fashions of the period. The exhibition was organised wonderfully, and I won't forget those pictures. A great collection of pictures and now I feel that I ""know"" Goya.",An amazing collection
"October 9, 2015","Na incredible collection, no doubt. I don´t really enjoy medieval paintings and their catholic themes, but even putting all that aside there´s still a marvelous collection of art. Don´t miss some of the most famous Van Gogh paintings display here.",A great art collection in pleasant setting
"October 4, 2015","The best thing about the National Gallery is its location - bang on the Trafalgar Square. The collection is remarkable - some of the paintings I recall are Leonardo's Virgin of the Rock, Van Gogh's Sunflowers and some iconic ones of Constable and Turner. One could easily spend a full day admiring the art. We also had one of the best cups of Darjeeling tea in the dining room.",Small but mighty
"September 28, 2015","What a lovely museum!  I look for Impressionists everywhere I go, so I was very happy to spend some quality time with some of the masters.  I am using a cane in prep for knee surgery and was very happy there was seating from which to enjoy the art.  Also appreciated elevators!  We had a pleasant lunch in the cafe.  And, if I recall correctly, the museum was free!",Nice London Interlude
"September 25, 2015",Enjoyable respite from the London fray especially on a rainy day.  Nice eclectic collection of master's paintings including a nice display of impressionists paintings...a crowd favorite.  Free admission in a beautiful historic building right on Trafalgar square.  Great cafeteria on the ground floor as well with delicious treats of all kinds.,Excellent Art Museum
"September 25, 2015",Excellent collection of paintings and the only downer we experienced was some of the rooms which held items we wanted to see were closed. The organization is superb and the interior of the building is beautiful. The site is free which is amazing considering just how good it is. A don't miss.,Excellent Art Collection
"September 24, 2015","Wonderful paintings of Monet, Van Gogh, William Turner, etc. The museum has had issues with worker strikes and not all of it is open but luckily the paintings I wanted to see were available.  It's a beautiful museum worth the effort to see it.",Fantastic art collection & no entrance fee!
"September 24, 2015","I first went to the National Gallery in 1987, and was thoroughly impressed with the Gallery and it's collection. Since my first visit, I have returned probably half a dozen times and still feel that I haven't seen everything. The building is beautiful and the artwork is displayed in the best possible way. It's hard to believe that the National Gallery doesn't charge an entrance fee, so with the rising ticket costs for attractions in London, there is absolutely no excuse for missing this one!",Always worth stopping in

"October 25, 2015","I didn't know I liked Van Gogh before I got here!  This art gallery is a great stop for folks who are interested in impressionist paintings and houses work from some pretty famous artists.  There is also an impressive collection of work from the 15th and 16th centuries.  We could have spent many more hours in this gallery than we actually did.  The staff were friendly and the bathrooms clean.  Really, for a free attraction, I can't complain.","Great collection, well showcased"

"October 19, 2015",I really enjoyed my visit to the National Gallery.  It is a beautiful building.  I wanted to show my daughter Van Gogh's Sunflowers which did not disappoint.  Only thing I would say is that it wasn't the easiest gallery to navigate.  I had wanted to see Vermeer and I had walked past it without noticing!  It would be nice if there was some kind of sign post indicating which artists were in which rooms - there may have been but I just missed it!,Show me the Monet!
"October 15, 2015","Has a wonderful selection of paintings from all eras. We were more interested in the Impressionists, of which we saw Van Gogh, Renoir, Pissaro, Manet, Monet, and Degas. They have the Van Gogh's famous sunflower painting, and Monet's Lily Pond. The National Gallery building itself is amazing! Don't forget to look both UP and DOWN!Would recommend going if you have a free afternoon. Choose what you want to see and go to see that. Allocate about 1 and a half hours for that. The Gallery café is nice (so we were told), and also the Gallery shop has some neat little things - not everything is terribly expensive.Admission IS free, however they do ask for a £5 (not verbally). Don't feel pressured to pay it if you don't feel like it, but £5 is a small amount to pay to see these amazing paintings :)","Monet, Manet, Renoir and... Soundscapes. Lovely."
"August 28, 2015","Great gallery. Lots of paintings to be admired. The only pity was that some parts were closed due to an industrial action of the personnel, so we could not see Caravaggio. By the way the Monet, Manet e Renoir paintings that we could see just left us astonished by their beauty.What's more we were really lucky because the ""Soundscapes"" exhibition was in place and it delighted our visit. 6 paintings from 1700 and 1800 were combined with music / Sculpture. Something that cannot be described easily. Just try!",Worth for your time spent!

"August 18, 2015","A treasure without price (literally); free admission.  Visited during the Monet Sunflowers exhibit (which was incredible) in February 2014, despite the date of this review.

"August 17, 2015","My wife and I took the train to London and especially wanted to see the Monet and Turner paintings in the National Gallery. On arrival we discovered that the staff were striking and so half the galleries were closed, these were the galleries with the Monet and Turner paintings. Words cannot describe how disappointed and disgusted we were.",Don't miss The National Gallery
"August 15, 2015","Unfortunately some of the Gallery was closed the day we visited, but what we were able to view made the trip there just wonderful.  The artwork is spectacular as well as the setting.  Definitely worth a visit.","If art history is an interest (or not), be sure to stop here"
"August 12, 2015","Our family of five consists of members who like art history and members who don't.  What made this place good for a whole family to visit (besides the fact that it's FREE) was the quickl access to various  period ""rooms""  of art, so you could focus on what you wanted to see without having to tour the whole place. There was also seating in all the areas we visited, so those who weren't as into the art had a place to sit and relax.  I loved the Impressionist period rooms, plus the Caravaggio art they had was a favorite.  Outside the National Gallery, there was a lot of sidewalk art, which was worth a visit just by itself, and which impressed everyone in our group.  When you visit, be sure to get a map at the Gallery entrance to guide your route!",Get up!
"August 11, 2015","I'm a little bias on this review because I appreciate art and I love architecture.First, the setting for this gallery is phenomenal. ..location, location, location!  The building is beautiful from the outside and sits prominently above the square. The activity in front of the building is an exhibition all to itself. The scale of views is what confirms the fact that London is a global city. Subsequently, the interior of the gallery is well laid out and easy to access. I assumed it would be more crowded since it had free admission but the amount of people was easy to disregard as you had plenty of moments to enjoy the art without feeling like you were in someone's way. The only exception possibly being around the Van Goughs. The interior rooms were elegant and served as wonderful and well lit backdrops to the art at hand. Second, The art was diverse and wonderful. Many great pieces by many great artists. Each period being well represented by the famous and not so famous, which gave a real substantive quality to the museum. Many photo and sketching opportunities are available.So, why the 4 out of 5 rating?  Because I felt that the modem arts were a little under represented,  but that was understandable after walking by some of the nearby auction houses  (ie the ""modestly"" priced Picasso which recently broke record)SoEnough reading, get up and go!

"June 14, 2015","This gallery was totally amazing. I seriously doubt that you could see the whole thing and take time to appreciate the various pieces of art in only one day. Coming back a second or even third day would be no problem as there is no admission fee...it's free to the public.The art work was sorted by type and date which made choosing which of the vast halls you wanted to see an easy task. We were amazed at how many priceless pieces were there for anyone to see up close. While we did not avail ourselves of their services, docents were everywhere and ready to answer questions about the various pieces of art.Please do not miss this wonderful gift to humanity.",For art lovers

"June 5, 2015","Although I enjoyed the classical paintings for me the architecture of the building was maybe the thing that I loved the most about the National Gallery. Oh, but then I came across the Monet's work and Van Gogh's Sunflowers. It was truly thrilling to view these paintings.

Don't miss the National Gallery!",Amazing collection
"June 5, 2015","This is an amazing destination for lovers of art.  However, like all such galleries, there is too much to appreciate all at once, and visitors find themselves aimlessly wandering from gallery to gallery getting more and more tired!  A Gallery guide for £1 is a good investment.  Even better is to attend with some goal in mind: some painter, or time period to investigate, and then to concentrate on that.  Most of the rooms have seating where you can sit and contemplate your favourite work (and rest your weary bones!)",great paintings

No compulsory entry charge and handily located at Trafalgar Square, it is rated number 1 for a reason!",I Can't Stop Going - Its Amazing
"April 30, 2015","I moved to London 8 months ago and I have been to the National Gallery more than any other museum in London.  Sure there are lots of others that are great (British Museum and the Museum of London to name two) but the National is my home away from home.  The Late Rembrandt exhibit was exceptional (my partner went twice) and Inventing Impressionism was my absolute favorite. So rarely does anyone even acknowledge that there is a ""business"" part of the art world and that artists need to be supported somehow - whether or not their style or manner of expression is popular.  Inventing Impressionism showed in dramatic fashion the importance of the gallery owner and collectors who helped create a legacy that we all enjoy today.  All of that said, no matter what the current exhibit is at the National Gallery - go - just go.  You will not regret it.",Brilliant
"April 26, 2015","Not to be missed if you like arts. Very, very rich collection, free entrance for all and large rooms, this is a world class museum.",Great for art lovers
"April 26, 2015","Visited the gallery with my daughter to see the inventing Impressionism exhibition.  It's a very interesting exhibition highlighting the advent of Impressionism.  Some of the art I loved, some I hated - all a matter of taste, but very good overall.  My daughter loved it as she has a passion for Impressionism.",Of course you do have to visit the National Gallery!
"April 26, 2015","The official cite for the National Gallery list 10 reasons to visit and I agree with all of them and would have no problem adding a bunch of reasons of my own. I would never tire of visiting the exhibits. Just amazing! A one day visit is simply not enough and you have to pick and choose which sections you want to see or you will get very tired. Before going to the Gallery, especially if you don’t have the luxury of multiple visits, research the gallery exhibits and they have lots of advice on what might interest you based on your love of art.",superb
"April 25, 2015","best museum I've visited. Free of charge. Beautiful paintings. Excellent store. interesting layout , although critics say it was built inefficiently. Still nice to look and see what the fuss about the architecture was about.",Something for everyone.
"April 25, 2015","From icons to the impressionists.  A wonderful collection.  Beautifully curated and cared for.  An classic old building and a new extension that, despite initial protestations, actually does work.  Somewhere to sample bit by bit if you have the opportunity.  And free, as are so many of London's galleries and museums.  Long may it last.",Inventing Impressionism
"April 25, 2015","This may be the best exhibition ever at the National Gallery. It's beautifully curated and each room tells a part of the story.Even if you aren't a great fan of Impressionism, this is a must-see for all who love art.",Majestic

"April 22, 2015","- One of the best collections of art in the World. Paintings from 1300 to 1900 are all there.  It is very difficult to see the entire collection in one or two visits. (may be the high-lights can be seen/ the brochure has the highlights with room numbers ).The interiors of the gallery itself is a place to see and enjoy. -One single place to see many Masters, Countries , impressionists et al. If you like art/paintings, you will be stunned to see the collection and this gallery  should never be missed at all ,if you are in London.. (I have seen a number of paintings many times.) - Entrance fee to this glorious  collection is FREE too.!! .  - Pl hire a audio guide; It will be very useful to enjoy the paintings. (a few times I have viewed paintings without the audio guide, I feel lost)  Let me share something. I have been visiting this Gallery from 1987!!  (until now, about 50 times plus, all more than 4 hrs ) latest visit being April 2015. (will be visiting again a few times in July and August '15.)",Inventing Impressionism--Go!
"April 20, 2015","The National Gallery is stupendous, even without seeing this special exhibition.  But as long as you're there, do see this show.  We are off to Paris next, and as we viewed this show we realized that some of the paintings we would have looked for at the D'Orsay and Louvre are HERE.  The paintings gathered together in one spot represent the finest art of the Impressionists.  The curators produced a booklet that comes with the price of admission that allows guests to browse through the galleries at an unhurried pace, reading about each painting without having to peer at wall plaques (which often blocks the view of others).  The colors, the textures, the vibrancy, the inspiration--it all comes through beautifully.  Despite the timed entry, the rooms are crowded,  Don't feel you need to see the paintings in order--just watch for openings at each painting and move in that direction.  You will be rewarded with a good look at some of the best art in the world. ",Van Gogh and Monet!
"April 20, 2015","Spectacular Van Gogh's Sunflowers, Monet's Waterlillies, Seurat's Bathers. There were quite a few rooms closed. It was strange. But still worth the visit!","Fabulous art, for free!"
"April 19, 2015","This museum is amazing.  Not only is it full lf fabulous art, but it is free to enter.  It is very well organized by centuries, which is helpful due to the vast spaciousness and amount of rooms of art that they contain.  Be sure to grab a map/guide upon entering.  Since it is free, it can be very crowded, especially with tour groups and school trips.",Amazing
"April 18, 2015","A must-see place. Impressive art collection. If you like art, reserve at least 3 hours to see the museum, and some good minutes to sit somewhere at Trafalgar Square enjoyng the London living.",Awesome
"April 16, 2015","The national gallery is one the atracción y London, the location, the arquitechture, and of course the art is one if not of the best in London","One of the best in the world, has to be!"
"April 11, 2015","Great master pieces free for all, extremely well kept, really worth the time. Need minimum 3 hours, I think! Would hold it personally at the same level as the Tate modern! Do visit, if around trafalgar, if if you are not a fan of history and art!",One of the world's best.
"February 13, 2015",What can I say?  These paintings are the ones featured in every art appreciation course you ever took.  And it is free!,Enjoyable
"February 9, 2015","The National Gallery is a must see. if your time is limited you can take an organised tour led by gallery lecturers which take about 1 hour. These tours visit some of the art works giving an overall view of the collection. If you do have the time for a lengthy visit it is well worth it  You can do an audio tour through the gallery and they cater for a number of languages. There is lift access, toilet facilities, food venues and a shop.   ",Amazing visionary experience.
"February 8, 2015","I visited National Gallery with a friend, I expected a great experience & didn't disappoint, it has over two thousand paintings & some of the most famous artwork worldwide, including Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers, Leonardo da Vinci's The Virgin of the Rocks, Caravaggio's a Boy bitten by a lizard, John Constable's The Cornfield, Claude Monet's Snow at Argenteuil, Pierre-Auguste Renoir's The Umbrellas & many many more. It's a must for all Art Lovers, it's an amazing experience. I felt honoured to see such visionary  breathtaking artwork, and a major part of history. ",Bit of a letdown...
"February 8, 2015","In the interest of full disclosure, we visited the National Gallery AFTER visiting the Vatican Museum and the Borghese Gallery in Rome.  Otherwise, I may have rated this much higher.  If you are visiting London, you should definitely include this on the itinerary.  Entrance to the museum is free (a donation is requested).  The highlights for us:  part of the original frieze from the Parthenon, the Impressionist collection which includes Monet's Japanese Bridge, Pisarro's Montmartre Blvd, Van Gogh's Sunflowers is quite impressive.  Be wary of pickpockets as you approach the museum.  There are many street vendors right in front of the entrance.  It is centrally located right in Trafalgar Square and near good restaurants and the tube.",Don't miss a quick trip to this gallery
"February 7, 2015","Stopped to see Sunflowers by Van Gogh and a few other famous paintings. Second trip to this Gallery. Definitely worth the time. If short of time at Trafalgar Square, ask staff for the key highlights. Coffee shop in basement nice for warming up and taking a break. Gift shop near by. ",Wonderful Art
"February 6, 2015","Rooms and rooms of artwork and it doesn't cost anything; what's not to like? It is also on Trafalgar Square, which is an important landmark.  I particularly liked the 20th Century stuff.",Free Monet
"February 2, 2015","Worth the trip for Monet's ""The Thames Below Westminster"" alone, the National Gallery houses hundreds of classics. The best part - admission is on a donation basis. ",A fantastic collection.
"January 31, 2015",A marvellous gallery and way to pass an hour or two as you marvel at the magnificent works of art on display.Whether you are an expert or simply have the slightest interest in what are some of the most iconic artworks in the world; the works are displayed with great skill and thought whilst being accompanied with a short and interesting explanation of each painting's history/provenance etc,They have Monet's Water Lilies!
"January 26, 2015","It's free and they have some impressive art work. For example, they had Monet, they had many religious works of art, they also had henry Rousseau... ",Always a must in London
"January 19, 2015","A stunning collection, uplifting and extreamly well represented through the different periods and movements throughout history. Conveniently situated centrally in London in a beautiful Neoclassical purpose-built gallery in Trafalgar Square.There is also a good eatery downstairs for refreshments and spending the whole day at the gallery isn't a hardship. The giftshop is well stocked with worthwhile literature and keepsakes.My Fine Art studies have deepened my appreciation for this calibre of art and gallery that I put at the very top of my list of things to do whist in beautiful London. Other galleries worthwhile are Tate Britain and Tate Modern if you appreciate Modern Art. I'm absolutely star struck when I leave these galleries.",Avoid exhibitions - they oversell tickets & pack you in
"November 28, 2014","The National Gallery is one of the most astounding collections in the world and to spend an hour or two here wandering around the galleries is a memorable thing indeed (I live in London and so have done this often). However, I was prompted to write a review based on the most unpleasant experience I had at their Rembrandt show. Although timed tickets there was a huge queue to get in, they sell far too many tickets and going around the show becomes unpleasant. I know these shows are about making money but surely they have to strike a balance and have some intent on giving guests a good experience. One of our foremost art commentators, Richard Brooks in the Sunday Times, said exactly this in a recent article in the ST. Shame on the National for taking our £16 and giving us an unpleasant experience.","Interesting place, takes lots of time"
"November 25, 2014","Art in all form, free entrance, lots of tourists. I was there for a few hours, and I didn't manage to see but a small part of it.",The Rembrandt show at London's National Gallery
"November 16, 2014","This is one of those very rare exhibitions that are truly ""once in a lifetime"" events. This large, comprehensive show of Rembrandt's late work in various media is superb, but the crowds are so heavy that you should (a) purchase tickets in advance and (b) arrange to come at 10am when the gallery opens. The show is wonderfully done, and  have only given 4 stars because the crowds make you work to see the pictures, It's worth the struggle.",Great museum!
"November 9, 2014",It was so neat to be able to go here (for free!) and see so many famous and historical paintings all in one place! They are all artfully displayed and have a short description of each piece. Seeing the Royal Family's portraits was a neat experience too!,Don't miss the Rembrandt exhibition
"November 9, 2014","My expectations of Rembrandt's Late Works was high, and this exhibition more than exceeded them.  It is glorious!  You would be wise to book ahead and then go slightly late (or early, the attendants are flexible) as on the hour and half hour f timed tickets, there is a queue to get in, and this means that the first few rooms are crowded.  This in no way detracts from the joy of seeing paintings familiar from art books glowing with a life and vigour.  How could such vibrant works have been painted in Rembrandt's later years?Do not miss, if you appreciate art.  Worth every penny of the rather high (£18) entrance fee.Tip:  the descriptions are not alongside the paintings, but in an excellent little booklet.  If anyone you know is going before you, ask them to pick one up for you, so that you can do a little pre-reading.",A must visit place
"November 4, 2014",The Supper at Emmaus by Caravaggio Room 32 and of course the Magdalen Reading by Rogier van der Weyden in Room 56 are worth a visit.,Excellent
"October 30, 2014","It is so amazing to see ""the masters"" work in person, and only a couple feet away.  Loved that I could also take photos, without flash of course.  Also loved that they included Rembrandt paintings that he had not completed.  So interesting to see his process in creating his masterpieces.  Spent over 4 hrs here and loved every minute.",The best place to spend a little extra time

"October 21, 2014",The National Gallery was VERY busy when I visited. It's hard to enjoy the art when you have to battle with tourists to be able to see anything. This isn't helped by the gallery's maze-like layout. The actual collection is impressive and admittedly a 'must see' but I think I enjoyed my time more at Tate Britain. It's much more quiet and relaxed and they have a great Turner collection.,The best place to spend a little extra time

"September 22, 2014","The National Gallery displays an amazing collection of renowned masterpieces from artists in the caliber of Van Gogh, Monet, Turner, Constable, Velazquez & many others that even people with limited art-related knowledge would recognize. The only downside in my opinion was the lighting which was insufficient in many parts of the Gallery, which seemed to rely too much on natural light.",The National Gallery at Trafalgar Square
"September 20, 2014","I love this whole section of London, and the National Gallery is an important part of it. The gallery is magnificent; breathtaking. Most of the museums in London, including the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery, are free. Both are adjacent to each other on the north side of Trafalgar Square, across the street from St Martin in the fields and just down Whitehall from the Palace of Westminster. Just behind the Gallery is the outlet for theater tickets and several theaters are very close. The only think that would make the gallery better would be if you could take photographs as you can in the National Portrait Gallery.",Just amazing.
"September 20, 2014",Could not be faulted. Great experience. Artwork is laid out in galleries in date format and as you move from room to room you meet the greats.

"March 9, 2014","The only negative comment I can make concerns the inconvenience of several halls being closed for re-hanging. May have just been bad timing, but it disrupted the flow significantly.

"February 12, 2014","The National Gallery at Trafalgar Square is one of several outstanding art museums in London.  It houses a wide range of fine art, spanning the 13th - early 20th century, representing a 'who's who' list of Western Europe painters and artists from these periods.  The National Gallery was founded when the House of Commons who decided to procure 38 paintings and begin a national collection in 1824.  This small collection has now expanded to over 2300 paintings and is visited by over 5 million people annually, making the National Gallery the 5th most visited art museum in the world. Before you visit, it is helpful to have a look at the National Gallery Website or at least a good London guidebook so that you can have a feel for the floor plan.  If you want to visit the entire collection, we would suggest 3-4 hours, allocating approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour to each section (1. – 13th to 15th century – Medieval Early Renaissance, 2.) 16th century – High Renaissance, 3.) 17th century and 4.) 18th to 20th century.) Each of the major sections includes 15-20 separate rooms with numerous outstanding paintings.  For us, it is difficult to envisage visits to the Gallery without seeing the entire collection at the National Gallery.  However, for those with limited time, you might want to visit the National Gallery Website – Plan Your Visit section to see the Printed Trails and 30 Highlight Paintings webpages. These might help you target a specific group of paintings or plan for a shorter visit.  Regardless of how long you intend to spend at the gallery, it is highly recommendable to pick up the The foldable, red-coloured National Gallery Plan (£1).  This provides a simple floor plan with four major sections along with a few of the highlight pieces for each section. On the back is a list of the individual rooms as well as its featured artist(s) or art period/ movement.  The Plan is also quite useful for helping you navigate your way around the Gallery.  In addition to the impressive permanent collection, there are special exhibitions (usually require tickets), which take place throughout the year at the National Gallery.  Refer to the Gallery website to find information about the exhibitions and to book tickets online.  You can also purchase tickets directly at the National Gallery as well.  There are several food and drink options within the National Gallery if required.  These include the National Café, which offers a nice range of afternoon snacks, coffee and tea drinks.  You can also find the Espresso Bar on the Ground Floor and more formal dining at The National Dining Rooms on the First Floor.  The main shop is located on the Ground Floor and you can visit just before leaving the museum if you want to pick up a museum book or souvenir.  They have some nice books which include a vast majority of the works you will have seen within the National Gallery.   Overall, we highly rate the National Gallery in London and appreciate the comprehensive coverage of important Western European art movements which can be explored here.  We eagerly anticipate spending time at the Gallery when visiting London and consider it one of our personal favourite attractions in the city.",National treasure

"December 13, 2013","The National Gallery like so many museums in London is free. What a treat. The building is located on Trafalgar Square, which is sort of a must stop and see spot with Lord Nelson statue towering over the plaza. The building of the gallery itself is worth a visit. Some of the treasures we found inside included Monet's famous bridge and water lilies, Van Gogh's chair and sunflowers. There were paintings from Renoir, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Van Dyck, and many more. Our favorite one was actually from a Finish painter we had never heard about. There are many treasures in this gallery. I highly recommend it. We visited on a Wednesday afternoon. The visitors in the gallery were quiet and respectful, and although there were a good number of visitors it was by no means crowded. Very enjoyable.",I was reminded I have a soul
"December 5, 2013","I stopped in here for 15 minutes.    4 hours later I was still here.    It is the strangest thing staring at a paintings you have seen images of on posters and mugs and learned about at school - here it is - right in front of your face!     How can a painting be 500+ years old?   It makes you think of how short life actually is when you consider how many generations before stood and looked at these things, and people will still be stood looking at them in the generations to come.............

It is always worth to consult their site for exhibitions! just saw an exhibition on ""making colours"" which is an amazing exhibition telling the history of the colors in art along the time. They put together the origin of the pigments, natural and artificial, the evolution of theory of colors, and some very well selected pieces of art as an illustration of the use of colors in art. It is done in a such simple and intelligent way you will enjoy the visit and will be smarter at the end learning that colors are all in our minds !!","See the ""hidden"" Da Vinci cartoon!"
"August 23, 2014","A true gem among great galleries, the building hosts a cartoon by Leonardo Da Vinci  which is placed in a small lightless chamber under heavy protection.

"June 30, 2014",I hate to say that we ran out of time watching the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace and were very limited to our time at the national gallery.  It is definitely something that I would go back to do.  What little we saw was amazing and did not realize how large and how much time it would take to get even a glimpse of what all they had to see.  Luckily my daughter had been living in England for a little while and had recently visited so she knew what to show us for a quick visit.,Perfect place for a rainy day.

"April 10, 2014","Three cheers for Nicholas Panny and Xavier F. Solomon for mounting this life-enhancing exhibition. The accompanying catalogue is flawless and beautifully written.Artistic genius, so often cited, so rarely found, as a stand-alone attribute, is probably of little use. For genius to flourish, to fulfil its destiny and bear exceptional fruit, it needs to co-exist and be touched by a unique mental strength, outstanding external influences and the fortuitous circumstance of time and place.As right and rewarding as it is to triangulate Veronese with Titian and Tintoretto, the sparks that did ignite his genius are to be found earlier in his development, mainly from his hometown.Verona, in the early sixteenth century, as for centuries before, was economically prosperous, culturally forward and even boasted a substantial quantity of Roman ruins; arches, columns and theatres. It is therefore not surprising that the programme of building undertaken at this time should look back to the monumental, elegant and assured style of Classical Rome as the ideal manifestation of Verona’s power and sophistication.The architect charged with overseeing a great deal of the building work was a local man, Michele Sanmicheli. It was Sanmicheli, along with resident artist Antonio Badile, who by dint of familial and professional connections, made young Paulo Caliari, as the stone-cutters son was named, their protégé, encouraging and guiding him in his studies of art and, importantly, architecture, by introducing him to the best practitioners. From Giovanni Caroto, he would have learnt the art of fresco painting; from Parmigianino, the refined depiction of passion; from Corregio, delicate modelling of features; from Lelio Orsi, the power of chiaroscuro in drawing; and from Durer, the sharp delineation of outline, so useful in painting drapery. Add all these influences to a remarkable visual imagination and there explodes on to the scene one of the most audacious audition pieces in art-history.The Conversion Of Mary Magdalene [ 1547 room 1]] is an interpretation of Aretino’s 1534 text, La Humanite di Christe. Veronese paints Mary and her sister Martha as they meet Jesus in a temple. Mary is deeply ashamed of her expensive and ostentatious clothes and begins to remove her jewellery. Though it is possible to detect many of those elements that would reoccur in Veronese’s later work, including the architectural background and half concealed figures, it is the exceptional use of colour, not so much in its range, but rather in the placement and subtle modulation that makes this work so original.It caught the eye of discerning wealthy patrons and over the next ten years Veronese developed and honed his style in a series of commissions including The Temptation Of Anthony Abbot [ 1552 ] for Mantua cathedral, which shows, in the muscularity of his central figure, a direct line of influence, through Giulio Romano, to Michelangelo.Naturally enough, he painted his patrons, borrowing the full length format used so well by Moroni, but one can guess that the single-sitter format didn’t appeal to Veronese’s innate sense of theatre, so he began incorporating entire families within a biblical narrative. In The Supper At Emmaus [ room 2], parents, children, relatives, servants and pets seem to exist quite happily as Jesus is recognised by the two disciples. Nowadays, such a depiction wouldn’t meet with our sense of decorum and appear as bad taste, but as a new genre of portrait painting in the sixteenth century it proved popular. Room 2 also contains the magnificent Martydom Of St. George and the Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine.In the words of Veronese’s biographer, Ridolfi, ‘ plants moved to a different soil often improve in grace and beauty’ By the mid 1550’s he had settled in Venice and he soared. Here he would have seen the vast horizontal pictures, known on account of the structure over which the canvas was stretched, as Telieri pictures which, in the hands of Vittore Carpaccio were magnificent and festive, full of sumptious colour, incident and noise. Whereas Carpaccio painted his crowds under the Venetian sky, Veronese brought them in, and placing his figures in architectural settings, created his great ‘Feasts’; The Feast in the house of Simon, The Feast in the house of Levi, The Feast of St Gregory and the Marriage Feast at Cana. These enormous canvases are too big to move to this exhibition, but there is, in room 3, at a fraction of the size, but still large and impressive, the enigmatic The Family of Darius before Alexander [1565-7]. This picture captures the moment when Darius’s mother, having expressed her deep gratitude for the way in which Alexander had treated her son, the defeated Darius, realises that she addressed Hephaestion by mistake. It is impossible to conclusively say who is who in this painting, whether Alexander is the figure in scarlet or the figure in orange and black, their gestures can be interpreted either way. It hardly matters, it is part of the appeal of the picture.Anyone wishing to exercise his neck should stand in the middle of room 5 and compare the two large canvases, The Adoration of the Kings [ around 1573-4]. Here in two similar pictures, a cortege of soldiers, servants, camels and horses, owing much to Jacapo Bassano in their fine detail and rendering, form a disorderly crowd around the infant Christ and Kings. Disorderly, not of course in the way we understand the word, but rather as the means of expressing a valid beauty and harmony, a pictorial device so often used by Veronese to animate his paintings, and here, against a set of ruined wooden buildings, reminiscent of Durer’s 1501 woodcut of the same name, with the extraordinary interplay of light and shadow, both paintings seem shot through with a sort of vulnerability, a kind of fragility. The words of Kenneth Clark come to mind when writing about the background in Leonardo’s Nativity: ‘ … the tatters of our imagination inhabits the ruins of intelligence’. In other words, all that is known, accepted and understood is turned on its head by the advent of Christ.The pictures in Room 6, known as the Four Allegories of Love are mysterious. It is unclear what they are saying and this makes them difficult, but if they are viewed without the encumbrance of meaning, as compositions of light and shade, of line and colour, they come alive as forceful and virtuosic pictures. They are full of movement. The facial expression in a figure in the picture titled ‘ Scorn’ reminded me of a photograph of Evelyn Waugh.In this room, too, is Venus and Mars. I suppose it is something of the nature of looking at pictures that people don’t expect to find humour, and therefore don’t recognise it, but in this naughty little canvas, Veronese demonstrates an impish sense of fun.In the final room there is a marked change of tone and colour. The paintings are dark and sombre. The reasons put forward for this change include the war with Turkey, the influence of Bassano and the terror of the plague. There may well be something in all of that. But I think after forty years of painting with dazzling colours, this move to darker hues must have come as something of a relief. A composer could not spend all his life writing in a major key, he would yearn for the tranquillity of the minor. The paintings are still full of life and energy, The Agony in the Garden [1583] for example, but the deeper colours give then a Tintoretto- like intensity, and the loose fluid brushwork in the Conversion of St. Pantalon is as close to Titian as is possible.  Nor should the darker tones be read as some kind of farewell. Veronese died from a short illness at the age of 60. Who knows what he might have gone on to paint.‘ Good judgement of painting could only be achieved by those who were well instructed in the art, and that ability was a gift of heaven; and that labouring at that without natural talent was like sowing in the waves’ Paulo Veronese.",Beautiful
"March 22, 2014","This is a wonderful gallery with many famous works of art. And it's free! In March 2014 they had a special exhibit of Van Gogh's sunflowers, which was really great.",Terrific
"August 4, 2013",Great place to spend a couple of hours.  Even the kids loved this place ( and no we are not the art expert snobs).  Go with a list of top 25 things to see.  It is freetoo!,Great if you like classical art
"July 29, 2013","I prefer modern art, so I'm not crazy about this museum, but it is a beautiful building, has magnificent collections, is free and it's all that busy.Would definitely recommend!",Disappointing
"July 22, 2013",I had great expectations but there were very few interesting paintings . Too bad the audio guid was good ....,"Overwhelming, but fantastic"
"July 8, 2013","Like the Louvre, the National Gallery contains so much amazing art, one can spend entire weeks there. We chose to select the pieces we wanted to see, and will go more in-depth next time. Great audioguides, but the maps are hard to decipher, so if you want to really know where to go to see a piece instead of wandering, ask the helpful guides who are posted in most every room. Work by Caravaggio, Leonardo, Michelangelo... all the greats. A must-see for the art lover.",Musical themes in paintings by Vermeer
"July 4, 2013","Five paintings by Vermeer, including an early painting not often seen, with musical themes.  I especially liked the explanation at the end of Vermeer's methods...very instructive.",Go straight to see Impresionist!
"June 8, 2013","This is our 3 rd visit to National Gallery. Love this place better than Louvre. We have never overwhelmed here, as we were at Louvre. The facilities such as cafe and was room was much better of than Louvre.We straight to green area room 42-45  to understand impressionist!  Enjoy the 1860s Edouard Manet  and his protegee Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley and other young artists in Paris who were experimenting with bright colour and rapid, sketch-like painting as they too tried to capture aspects of contemporary life.Then we after Vincent van Gogh, but the Sun Flower was not there. It was on loan. We still could see Van Gogh’s Chair, Crab, Farms near Auvers and ""gorgeous"" A Wheatfield, with Cypresses. Then his close friend's still art art Paul Gauguin, who lived and worked with him in autumn 1888. We compare Cézanne who emphasis on structure and solidity in his art by using colour rather than light to convey forms. Enjoy the Bathers (Les Grandes Baigneuses), it is wow!  In his later years, his innovative compositions won the respect of younger artists. Camille Pissaro was also impressive. Look at The Boulevard Montmartre at Night.  That's why these art all called impressionist, to impress us.",Very interesting
"June 4, 2013","It's free woo! And the art is stunning, well worth a look. Always some sort of protest going on outside if the kids get bored and want something to look at",Not just a bunch of portraits
"May 7, 2013","Ok, it is.  I was very surprised at the stories that the portraits told. I enjoy art and was expecting more of a gallery.  The layout of the museum and the portraits tell the history of London with a lot of information not only about the portrait, but what was going on at the time.  Make sure you do the audio tour.",Welcome to the Treasure Dome
"April 27, 2013","If you think to see it all, think again. This museum is just too much. Too much beauty, too much legend, too much treasure, too much to see.So this is what I recommend you to do: visit the website in advance, decide which paintings you REALLY want to see, make a list and make sure you see these. I'd rather visit a few times 1hour than being numb after 2hours because I've seen too much and I can't realize anymore what extraordinary beautiful artworks I am seeing. Location near Trafalgar makes it easily accessible, so several visits shouldn't be a problem. Have fun!",One of my all-time favorites.
"March 26, 2013","I used to come here every week when I studied in London to sketch. Keep coming back every time I'm in town to show my friends. It's a wonderful gallery and, best of all, it's free.Be sure to checkout Whistlejacket by George Stubbs - one of my all-time favorite paintings, along with the impressionist rooms - filled with classic paintings by Monet, Van Gogh and Pissarro.",it was wet
"September 19, 2011",i did not enjoy gallery as it was religous but had a snack in restraurant  it was a big sandwich,Awe inspring
"September 17, 2011","An amazing collection of artwork in a fantastic location.  We took our three kids (8, 4 and 2) for about an hour, that;s about all they can handle at that age!  Oh and it is 'free' but you really should give a donation...The cafe in the basement is worth a visit for some wonderful cakes etc.",Wonderful!!
"September 16, 2011","I love this place. There's so much to see and take in. I only wish they'd allow visitors to take photos, as it would help me take notes and remember things I've noticed during my visit.",Super Attraction
"September 14, 2011",Take the time and visit this gallery!  I visit it at least 4 times per year and always find the paintings here captivating.  You can pop in for an hour and hit the rooms that of interest.,National Gallery...a treasure in plain London's heart
"September 11, 2011","The building is amazing, the location couldn't be better and the art pieces inside are overwhelming: from Da Vinci to Boticelli, from Vermeer to Holbein, Goya, Van Gogh, Cézanne, Gauguin...Give National Gallery one day, try next the National Portrait Gallery next to the building.Great great way to lift your soul!","Beautiful artwork, not great for everyone though ..."
"September 11, 2011","Although i really enjoyed my trip to the gallery, sadly my kids did not. This place is not for children, all other children i saw there were just running around, they had no interest in it what so ever, so not for kids.",Spend the day and get blissfully lost!
"September 3, 2011",No matter how many times I visit the National Gallery I always find an area I hadn't explored before. I could absolutely spend the whole day walking around here. Plus it's free admission how can you beat that? This is a must see for anyone traveling to London.,Make a game of it
"August 25, 2011",I knew that a visit to the National gallery with three children would likely be a disaster. So we did a bit of research before our trip a prepared a game for the kids.I pre-ordered a sticker book of National Gallery paintings online from Amazon (The Usborne Art Sticker Book) Then we made a game of searching for the paintings and then attaching the stickers in the book.  We managed to survive two hours before the kids got tired.,"Always great, a little disruption with renovations"
"August 25, 2011","Usually I  give the National Gallery a 5 star, which of course the works are.  Just now allow a little extra time as many works have been moved around due to renovations prior to the Olympics.  Staff are super helpful directing you to your favourite works.Why not donate a few pounds to keep it free :)",Always my first stop in London
"August 24, 2011","Having been to the National Gallery before, I decided to do the 'must see' pictures such as the Sunflowers by Vincent Van Godh, The Haywain by Contstable etc and my favourite painting by Jan Van Eyck - The Arnolfini Portrait.  Whats amazing about the gallery is that it is free so you can call in several times to see the paintings you wish to see as it is so tiring to see so many paintings in one day.  Had a wonderful visit and thoroughly enjoyed these famous paintings.  Every time I come, I get something more from the paintings which i see.  It is located in Trafalgar Aware and the station to get off at is Charring Cross.","Priceless artwork at no cost, what more could we ask for?"
"September 13, 2009","Definitely visit the National Gallery if you are in London, even if you only choose to see the big name artists such as Van Gogh, Rapheal, DaVinci, Michelangelo, and Monet. They are all there, and if you pick up the quick tour pamphlet at the visitor's desk you can find them easier with a detailed map of the highlights; otherwise the many interconnected galleries can be daunting.I visited in the afternoon on a weekday and despite being a free attraction the place was not that crowded except around Van Gogh's Sunflowers. Everything else was quiet and peaceful, and it may have been my imagination but I believe the gallery is air conditioned because it seemed quite cool compared to the heat outside. I spent two hours there and could have easily spent more as an art buff, but felt I was able to see the big names and then some.My favorite unknown find was a lithograph series about marriage in which the artist painted a series of almost comedic painting depicting the tragic outcomes of a marriage made for ambition instead of love, including adultery, disease, and ultimately death--it was ironic and almost reminded me of a political cartoon series. If you go, spend a few minutes admiring the fountains in Trafalgar Square and St. Martin's in the Fields.",National Gallery Review
"July 2, 2009","The National Gallery is pretty decent. Its free (thought they ask for a donation), as are the audiotours. I wouldn't say it is worth a whole lot of time. Maybe I'm spoiled from having been to some of the famous art museums in France and Italy, but there are a lot of other places in London that I would rather visit. If you have a lot of time its worth a look. And if you know of a couple paintings you really want to see, you can just go and find them, then leave. I've posted some photos and tips from my time in London on my travel blog [--]Enjoy!",Nothing else like it
"May 20, 2009",I am here all the time. It is one of my favorite places. There is no where like it in the world.,Entirely wonderful!
"April 15, 2009","The National Gallery in London is one of my favourite museums/galleries - it is well worth a visit but bring time or rather, concentrate on only parts of the collection (maybe also catch a temporary exhibition in the Sainsbury Wing, I saw ""Americans in Paris"" in 2006 and it was well worth the return one evening - though special exhibitions usually come with a charge - if a specific one is of interest to you), or else you might perhaps get a little overwhelmed and tired. Admission is free so you may come again as often as you choose - my personal favourites are the paintings from 1700 onwards (Turner, Gainsborough, Constable in particular) on the 2nd level.Take a break in between at the National Café and have a look into one of the well stocked shops, too.",My favourite museum
"March 14, 2008","The National Gallery happens to be my favourite museum. It's a wonderful place to visit on a trip to London. However I must say, you probably won't get through all of it in one afternoon as the place is quite overwhelming. It's hard to decide which room to go to next. I am delighted to say that it will keep the visitor happy. And if you need a break there's a nice cafe downstairs. The museum also has several gift shops.",A waste of an afternoon and money 
"November 25, 2023","A Great Exhibition ruined by an absurd management decision to offer a free download of commentary to visitors mobile phones. Unfortunately, most people using the download do not have earphones, so you will hear commentaries at different stages from multiple phone loud speakers. If you think about the demographics of mainly older people visiting the exhibition, you can imagine how loud some of the commentaries are! Apparently, this exhibition will move on to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and they supply good old-fashioned audio guides with personal earphones, so you won't have your enjoyment ruined there -  if you are able to travel to the Netherlands. ",Must see - and free
"October 25, 2023",The National Gallery in London is truly fantastic. You should spend a few hours in the various halls. Nice care also. Free to enter.,The Tudors
"September 17, 2023","Came specifically to see the tudor period paintings and I wasn't disappointed! A must see if you are a fan of the period. Didn't have time to explore the other floors, another visit another time.. hopefully!",yesyesyes
"September 9, 2023","well it’s amazing. It’s free, completely free. I booked just in case but there was no checking so! You just go in. There was a lot of people even though it’s was a week day but it was OKAY-And the paintings, well, what can I say. Must see in a lifetime.",Paintings from European masters
"September 1, 2023","Master paintings from the middle ages to renaissance. My idea of heaven. Free entry, they want you to make a reservation, but in our case it wasn't needed.",An absolute must-visit. Awesome!
"August 27, 2023",Fabulous!Super collection of art which is mind-blowing. Allow a lot of time. Can be slightly confusing about where you’ve just been and where you’re going but that could have just been us! The paintings will leave you over-awed. Do not miss when in London!,Great museum!
"August 22, 2023","I really enjoyed this one. Lots of the kind of art I like. Impressionists, historical stuff. Our first trip to London, gotta go see it. ",Amazing galary
"August 11, 2023","In one word - wow. Amazing. Impressive. Endless variety of pictures, each is better detaled and looking than the other.",Do The Highlights Tour
"August 6, 2023","I think the “highlights” (greatest hits) tour is brilliant. It’s like a course in art history, from beginner to advanced. Plus it helps focus one’s attention within the monumental collection. I could spend days in the National Gallery, but this is a roadmap to 1-2 stupendous days. Highly recommend.",Excellent
"July 31, 2023","Excellent experience, the gallery is free and has so much great art . Would 100% recommend Love it 😍",After Impressionism is an amazing exhibition
"July 19, 2023","The ""After Impressionism"" exhibit at the National Gallery is a treasure with works by Van Gogh, Seurat, Picasso, Matisse, Gaughin, Cezanne, Mondrian, and a bevy of lesser known artists who were all groping their way towards an entirely new medium. Seeing all of the various threads of modernism emerge out of the Impressionist revolution was glorious.",Do not leave London without going
"July 5, 2023","Simply one of the world's great museums, and thanks to British taxpayers, it is free.  Best to go close to opening when it is less crowded.",Trip in July 2023

"May 31, 2023","The National Gallery exceeded expectations. We reserved an entry online for a weekday afternoon which was perfect. The art is amazing, as is the building itself. The Van Gogh sunflowers were luminous. Download a map of the place beforehand and you can get turned around.",very  busy spot and so much to see!

"December 7, 2022","Wandered into the National Gallery this morning and noticed that there were free tours at 3 pm – so decided to come back then. Such a good decision! Carlo’s tour was possibly the best tour I’ve had of anything anywhere: full of detail about ‘the story’ being told by the painter, the way artists contrive to draw viewers into their works and encourage reading of them, snippets of art history and painterly technique. As well as gaining fascinating insights into the individual paintings picked by Carlo for the tour (apparently different paintings are selected for different tours), participants will have left, equipped with lots of transferable skills for enjoying future visits to galleries and exhibitions.All this with energy, drama, wit and warmth and humble kindness. National Gallery, if you have an “employee of the month” award – this is your man!",Excellent collection of paintings
"November 27, 2022","Cant believe this experience is free in the UK. Saw loads of kids being brought to the gallery for a field trip. There are cloak rooms on every level to leave your bags and jackets. You need more than a day to do justice to this gallery.  The restaurant directions need to be improved. You can reach it from Level 2 but the directions are extremely confusing. Beware of cheats masquerading as police offers in Trafalgar square waiting to take the unsuspecting tourists for a ride. We were accosted by a girl outside Canada house who asked us to take a photo. This was at 6.00 pm and it was dark. We were tired and hunting for the entry to the Charing Cross subway. After we finished the photo, she struck up a conversation asking us where we were from.  Suddenly 2 men, pretending to be police, asked us if the woman was bothering us and asked to see our papers. Thankfully I had my wits around me and asked to see identification. One of the men pulled down this jacket zipper and showed us a ID which had his photo but said ""Student..."" and the other showed us some kind of badge. We asked to see the ID again and they disappeared in the blink of an eye. ",Wonderful collection

"June 20, 2021",Enjoyable visit - you need to pre-book during the pandemic.  Choose one of three routes through the galleries - this was a bit confusing at times as we sometimes were not sure if we still on our original route!  Lovely to end up the newly decorated Hans Rausing gallery which looks beautiful.,Not what it used to be.  What?  Only one Salvador Dali?

"March 16, 2020","The galleries are excellent, staff extremely knowledgeable, this was a pleasure to visit and view. However we did visit after 2pm and found there was no soap or hand cleanser available in the toilets,  with the threat of a contagious virus and signs warning us, found the lack of basics not acceptable, and especially as the gallery was down on footfall so less people using the services.",Free entry
"March 15, 2020","There is security screening before you go in, but we didn't actually go to the gallery - we just used their clean amenities which were to the right of the screening process.  Imposing building set in Trafalgar Square.","Beautiful building, beautiful art"

"March 19, 2020",National Gallery is a nice place to visit. Tourist tip: don't use the ATM in the Square. Clever crooks using skimmers and hidden cameras . Fellow tourist was scammed ,Beautiful paintings
"March 16, 2020","We opted for just a part of the Museum. Very easy to find the areas you are looking for, but at some places it was a bit crowded and people were allowed to stand in front of the paintings taking selfies “for hours”",Light lunch.
"February 21, 2020","Good quality and choice of different styles of food. But what was on show was not really what we received. Just a sandwich on a plate with no garish or salad.  Told that was extra. Also I had to wait so long to pick up my coffee, my food was cold by the time I returned to the table. For what we received it was very expensive.  ",Lovely

"February 16, 2020",Most visitors probably wander through this amazing gallery without much planning but if you visit the website and study the galleries and do a little research into the individuals you will find your visit truly enriched--and may even discover some surprises as we did. This was our 3rd or 4th visit but so much more enjoyed by focusing on a few select galleries and having done some pre-visit reading.,Terrific as always
"February 15, 2020",Some things are so good they never change. The National Gallery never fails to excite. And it is free!!,very particular museum
"February 15, 2020",as per my title i found this museum very particular . A lot of very interesting stuff to see. especially my wife enjoyed it so much .I am happy i visited it ,So many Monets
"June 22, 2019",I am a huge fan of Monet and other Impressionists.  It was so great to see so many.  I was a bit disappointed that the Van Gough Sunflowers painting was moved to a different museum.,Loved the portrait galleries
"June 22, 2019",We stopped in to see the Tudor and Victorian portrait galleries - they are really amazing to see.  No lines to get in as all museums are free in London. Well worth a visit - we skipped any modern exhibits and just focused on the Tudor and Victorian works - awesome!,So much better than the Louvre!!
"June 22, 2019",If you are taking a European trip to see art this is a must see.  We spent a day here and could have stayed much longer.  The museum is not over crowded.  It is also quiet and has a lovely cafe inside.  The art will knock your socks off.  Security was quick and efficient.  If you are debating here or the Louvre be sure to come here.  The difference in your experience of the art is 100% better.,Arty daughters birthday trip
"June 24, 2019","I’m not hugely into art, but I did thoroughly enjoy this visit. So much history. Would definitely return ",Must see
"June 24, 2019",Hadn't been here for years but it's just as good as ever. Absolutely stunning paintings in such a beautiful building. Helpful staff when we needed directions. A bit of a maze and would definitely try to get a floor plan if visiting again. Lots of famous paintings that are easily recognised. Quite tiring as lots of walking but there are some benches to sit. Added bonus is that there's no entrance fee. Really recommend.,Fantastic and Free!
"June 23, 2019",It's a can't miss if you go to London. Go early to avoid the worst of the crowds bu it's always busy.Check what current paid exhibition is available and book for these.,MUST GO IF YOU LIKE ART AT ALL
"June 23, 2019",This museum is massive with everything for anyone's particular taste.  It's free so you might as well go.  I would choose going to this place over the more touristy things like going on the London Eye.  ,Sorolla exhibition
"June 23, 2019","Not been here for a long time ,lovely exhibition ,well layed out ,was well attended flowed well .Had lunch in the restraint, food was very good ,only thing was the service not great ,waitedover thirty minutes had to cancel in the end as we were booked to   go in to the exhibition",The Sorolla exhibition is a must
"June 23, 2019","The Gallery is so vast that you can't really take it all in during one visit, so we decided to concentrate on the Sorolla Exhibition which finishes in a few weeks. It was well worth the visit. The only problem was that to appreciate his painting, you need to stand far back and that was difficult to do as the gallery was quite crowded. ",Wonderful Impressionist paintings
"June 23, 2019","I am not an aficionado of art but, having a couple of hours to spare, wandered in from Leicester Square to pass some time. I am so pleased I did! I was especially intrigued by the Impressionist collection. So many of the painitngs are well known, but the difference between prints and photographs and the original paintings was amazing. The collection of Monets and Renoirs in particular enchanted me. I was also very taken with Seurat's pointillism technique- up close thousands of dots, take a step back and it transforms into wonderful coherent pictures. So many other paintings I could highlight, but each to their own appreciation!I did not find the gallery easy to navigate, even with the map (£2). I look forward to returning to the gallery again- amazingly it is free to visit.",Great Collection!
"June 23, 2019","I wasn't super happy with the organization (rooms sometimes run together and not in any planned way), but the collection itself was nice. Many historical portraits for British history, but there were also a decent number of modern pieces, which I loved!",Very interesting
"June 23, 2019","A lovely attraction, very interesting.  Quite hard to navigate in places but recommended nonetheless. ",Broad collection very well presented.
"June 23, 2019","Although entrance is free a donation of 10 £, $ or € is recommended and the visit more than justifies it. The collection is logically laid out with clear signage enabling either a focused visit or a more leisurely browse through the ages. Headphones are available for £5 although most of the signage is informative. The collection is extremely broad with an excellent representation of artists, styles and periods.A great way to pass a few hours. Highly recommended. ",Stunning works you must see
"June 22, 2019",Best single artist exhibition in years. His use of light is amazing and capture of movement quite astonishing. Other remarkable feature is range of compositions.,Truelly magnificent masterpieces.......
"June 22, 2019","The National Gallery in London houses a vast collection of I international art from all the great masters, we particularly wanted to see John Constables The Haywagon and it did not dissapoint. From Monet, Picasso, Sisley and all the greats to an amazing collection of Byzantine religious art there is something for everyone.

"June 21, 2019","A great place for a protest outside the National Gallery.  Stand Up for Julian Assange 6th July 2019 14.00. is another opportunity to participate. This is a wide open space and so it will offer lots of room for protesting. The last protest there on 01/06/19 looked great, however the space could accommodate loads more people!",Always worth a visit
"June 21, 2019","I come here whenever I'm in London - it's always worth a browse and, of course, the special exhibitions are excellent.",Amazing paintings

"June 18, 2019","We were in Trafalgar Square and it started to rain, so popped into the Gallery and whiled away nearly an hour wandering through the various rooms. I find it a very tranquil place and very soothing, excepting the rooms where there was a school party.We saw many of the famous paintings and enjoyed the different styles, my husband is not really into art but was glad he went.Many thanks",Need few hours to really view
"June 18, 2019",Excellent collection of art worth visiting but you need a few hours to really absorb the collection/ ,Interesting but
"June 18, 2019",Free to go in but disappointed they were asking £19 for one exhibition and £17 for another so we saw neither. What a shame but lots of other items to see. Makes sense to plan in advance rather than just wonder around,A Classic Collection
"June 17, 2019","Old classic architecture is an appropriate setting for Britain's collection of art. Located right at Trafalgar Square this museum is in walking distance of other must see sites. Since it is free, its worth a quick visit!",Just go!
"June 17, 2019","Great works of art to see for free! You'd be foolish to miss it. You won't like it all - but even if you only like one painting what have you to lose?

"January 7, 2020",The staff is rude! I went with my parents and my mom was not aware that the staff who entered the lift first had press the floor button that we are going to so she tries to press the button again. The staff just push her hand away harshly and said don't touch!,OKAY
"January 7, 2020",Given that the place was rammed and the booking system was not working there people managed to feed us well enough,Definitely a Must See.

"December 29, 2019",This is definitely an amazing museum. We visited the Egyptian exhibition. It was incredible and we had just done an extensive tour of Egypt. Don’t expect to see everything g in one day,A Cultural Highlight of any Visit to London
"December 29, 2019","The National Gallery in Trafalgar Square is a British Cultural institution with over 2300 paintings spanning the Renaissance to the late 1800s. The collection includes works by such masters as Peter Paul Rubens, Claude Monet, Rembrandt, Jan van Eyck, Johannes Vermeer, Sandro Botticelli, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, JMW Turner, El Greco, Titian, and of course the true masters of the Renaissance, Michelangelo and Leonardo DaVinci. You’ll need 3-4 hours to do the collection some justice, though crowding can often mean waiting a few minutes to see some of the highlights without obstruction. Definitely worth a visit.  An added benefit, through 26 January, is the Leonardo DaVinci special exhibit focused on a single painting - The Virgin of the Rocks. The exhibit tries to deconstruct the painting and explore DaVinci’s mindset as he created this masterpiece. My favorite part of the exhibit was the room where the actual painting hangs on the wall of an imagined chapel—giving the viewer a chance to see what the painting might have looked like in chapel as intended by the artist.",A visit
"December 29, 2019",National Gallery is a great place to visit we had Vouchers for all the museums and Gallery's plus the London Eye  also the Royal Albert Hall for a Concert  we are so pleased to do what we can as I WON With  the Daily EXSPRESS  ,Superb

There was a free booklet which explained every exhibit, peasier to use than a headset.One of the best lit exhibitions when viewed from a wheelchair (or as a child). A lot of thought has been put into this, and it makes all the difference to a disabled person. ",Well Worth A Visit
"December 26, 2019",This place is remarkable. So much great art to see. They have some great gift stores and a few nice cafes to have coffee in. Every time we come to London we go here and it has not disappointed us. Love it.,Don't miss it

"December 23, 2019","I went here on a Sunday afternoon during Christmas season and while the museum was busy, it wasn't overly crowded. I was delighted to find that admission is by donation. You could easily spend a day here - it is quite overwhelming and probably best to have an idea in mind of what you want to see beforehand. Some highlights include the galleries devoted to the Post-Impressionists, with greats from Seurat, van Gogh, and Cezanne on display. There is also a great section devoted to the Dutch masters, including iconic works by Rembrandt, Rubens, and others.",Brilliant!

"December 12, 2019","Lots of rooms crammed with amazing art from 1300 to 1900. I wasn't much interested in the first centuries (personal taste, every painting is related with religion, which quickly got on my nerves) but when the art is allowed to grow apart from bigotry, it gets very interesting. I loved the impressionists rooms.",All the greats!
"December 12, 2019",Mesmerizing paintings from all the greats throughout the centuries! And it's free! 10/10 would recommend.,Leonardo
"December 1, 2019",Yet another great exhibition with some stunning effects. If you’re a fan of Da Vinci don’t miss this whilst it’s on. Paying £4:00 to leave a jacket and bag in the cloakroom seems a bit steep but if it helps keep the Gallery going it’s a small price to pay ,lunch when visiting the gallery

From Italian Renaissance to French Impressionist to Dutch Masters.  So much to see in this museum!,Leonardo exhibition
"November 28, 2019",Interesting and innovative approch to give the onlooker a greater insight in to painting. Four halls each addressing another manner of considering the Madonna on the Rocks.It was very well presented but I felt there was not enough. I spent 30 minutes in the exhibition and was left feeling somewhat short changes. There wasn't as much as I thought in the exhibition. ,nice interior
"November 16, 2019",very tasteful interior design with adequate food and drink. not cheap. Rhubarb flavoured drink was sickly. Could have been good. Didn't see if it was licensed. Without beer best to drink water with the food.,Art 100%

"November 15, 2019","Been to most of the great museums in the world and I'm the guy normally sitting on the couches after 30 minutes twiddling his thumbs until the rest of the group is done ""enjoying"" everything.

"November 13, 2019","Each time we are in London, we visit the National Gallery. - a bonus is that it has free entry to all the permanent exhibits.  Each time we have visited, there have been groups of schoolchildren who always appear to be well-behaved and polite.  One could spend days or weeks there and still not see everything, such is the variety of exhibits.  I particularly enjoy seeing the Impressionist paintings - such a plethora or art! - as well as the paintings by Vermeer.",Impressive

"November 9, 2019","This museum sits right in Trafalgar Square, so, its location can't be beat. Their collection is very good for the years that it spans, and the rooms are organized chronologically. They don't have any paintings past the early 20th century, and there are no other forms of art (e.g., sculpture). The building itself is beautiful, with some neat mosaic tile floors. We liked it enough that we visited it twice during the week we were in London. As a side note, it was extremely crowded both times we were there.",Another great free “thing”
"November 9, 2019","It should be called “international treasures” - the collection is so vast it needs more than one visit so you don’t get “galleried out”. PS remember, the portrait gallery is just around the corner.",The Nations favourite

"November 8, 2019","The National Gallery was on our list of stops when we went to London but due to terrible weather we hid here for a while.Lovely place to visit with beautiful artwork. Would recommend that you hire the audio description as we didn't and struggled to get close enough to the popular exhibit to read the blurb.Cafe was busy, ridiculously overpriced and not very clean, so would suggest finding a cafe nearby for refreshments and there are plenty. ",Masterpieces in a Stunning Museum
"November 8, 2019",Every art lover must see this fantastic museum. So many of the masterpieces we've only seen in photographs are right there to be admired. ,Gorgeous museum
"November 8, 2019","Classic museum experience. I was especially pleased by the openness and lightness.  Of course, filled with people, but I never experienced the crowded feeling.

"November 6, 2019",I love the national gallery.It’s easy to spend the whole day inside. The artists are well signposted so it’s easy to get to Van Gogh if that’s what you are after.,Disappointed with staff/ museum attitude
"November 6, 2019","Went to national gallery with family members on a holiday where we went to most of the large museums in London. When we asked on entering the national gallery London where we could eat our picnic we were told by a member of staff that she didn't think there was anywhere in the building. We were surprised by this as the natural history, science museum both have picnic rooms for public use. When wandering the galleries we came across a sign which said 'picnic rooms' so we followed and found a room with long tables in and one lady and her young child eating their picnic so we went in and started to eat ours. After about ten mins the door was opened by a member of staff who ' demanded did we have permission to be in this room?' we all told him that it said picnic rooms and the sign on the door said public use. He told us that 'we couldn't just use it'. I asked was the room needed right now for a group? He just muttered ' don't bother' and left! We ate our lunch. My family and the other lady both commented how the museums attitude to the public eating in a picnic room was unfortunate and very contrary to other museums in London and across the country. This was half term and we could not find anything for the children to ' get involved' in art within the museum. ( No hands on areas, or draw your own picture etc) We have been to many museums with all our children over many years in many countries and we are very disappointed that Britain's own national gallery has made us feel unwelcome and does not see it has a role to play in encouraging people of all ages ( from young to old) to grow a love and passion for art. We saw the paintings we went for, which were amazing but I  would not return. ",Mrs
"October 31, 2019",Well organized and I was very pleased to see how many families with children visited the museum. Coffee shops were effective and well organized. The only (important to me) thing I missed was that I couldn't find any list of items to see. I wanted to see the emperor pinguin egg that Captain Scott brought to Britain -and I couldn't find out if it was on display. ,Great  free day out.
"October 31, 2019",Great day out with trafalgar square on front of it. Fantastic  location right in the middle of everything. Will easily take the full day and a brilliant day out.,Treasures to see
"October 31, 2019","A very modern museum with a lot of ""painted"" history. They accept the London Pass, but only for the visiting exhibitions, and if you want to see the rest you have to buy a ticket. A very good experience.",One of the best art galleries in the world 
"October 31, 2019",Visited for the Gauguin Portrait exhibition. It was fantastic but so is the permanent collection.  Always worth a visit for anyone in London.  ,Amazing experience

"October 30, 2019",The collection in the National Gallery is very impressive and the information beside each painting is easily understood and (usually) easy to see. You can fairly easily find your way around without a guide/audio guide (there are maps on the wall near some of the staircases and they have helpful staff in most of the large rooms). The list of painters represented is outstanding with only the Van Gogh/Monet room being too crowded to see the paintings properly. The crowding in this room was due to having too many tour groups in there at once - and while we were there one of the staff members started politely dealing with the congestion. My 11 year old daughter was also easily able to find a seat if she got tired.,Excellent art museum
"October 30, 2019","Their art collection was very impressive. They had incredible works of art including Michelangelo, Leonardo Da Vinci, Rembrandt, the full range of impressionist artists like Monet, Van Gogh, Pissarro, Renoir, and on and on. We had to basically run through parts since we only had two hours. We could have easily spent a full day there. My advice is to start in the farthest room (I think it’s 46) and work your way forward.",Ancient history

However, for me the building itself was the most memorable feature - absolutely beautiful !",breathtaking
"October 14, 2019","An amazing collection of magnificent art across many periods and styles.  The architecture of the building itself is breathtaking. A suggestion is that you visit in the morning as the crowds in the afternoon can limit the enjoyment.  Plus, it's totally free!",worth a visit.

"October 12, 2019","Not our first time here, but wings that were closed during a visit a few years ago were open. Spent a couple hours walking through the galleries - which themselves are works of art. We were there in the morning and it was crowded with school groups, but remarkably well behaved one. A lot of people around major paintings, but not too bad. My favorite was the Holbein ""The Ambassadors."" The distorted disk at the bottom of the painting becomes a skull when viewed from the far right and stooping to look up at it.",One of the Best Museums in the World
"October 12, 2019","This is a must visit for those who love all all the way to those who only have a passing interest. The collection of art in this museum is simply stunning. From Renaissance masters, to the Dutch golden age painters, to the French impressionists, this museum has it all, and has only the best. So many of the world's most famous painting's are held here that it would be impossible to name them all. If you're in London, you must not miss this!

"October 1, 2019","This is probably one of the finest collections of art on Earth and completely free!

"September 27, 2019","In addition to the great art and the pageant of the gallery, there is a special pleasure to people watching. This is a very democratic museum. You might find historians of art on one bench and school children learning to sketch on another. People are taken with the imagery and that in and of itself is wonderful to witness.

"September 26, 2019","If you're used to shelling out big bucks to see famous works of art at the Hermitage, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Louvre, and the Museum of Fine Arts, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the cost of the admission to the National Gallery: it's free! I love going here when I'm in London because if I only have a few minutes I can always pop in to see a few rooms without having to budget an entire afternoon. It is also open late on Fridays, which is a boon in a city where many tourist spots close down by 5p.m. It is easy to find ""must see"" lists for this museum on the internet, but of special note are 4 Van Goghs (including one of his sunflower works), a couple of Rembrandts (including Belshazzar's Feast), a few by Rubens, and several Gainsboroughs. There is also a Seurat, a Degas, and a Turner work entitled ""The Fighting Temeraire"" that will be featured on the new twenty pound bank note starting in 2020. Those are just the highlights.

"April 17, 2019","Get yourself to the national art gallery, what a fantastic experience to see some of the best art ever painted. I couldn't believe you can see the incredible pictures for free. I went specifically to see the Haywain by Constable I was blown away with the pictures by among others, Gainsborough, Caneletto and the bloke who paints sunflowers all amazing if visiting London make this a must visit",Brillian permanent collection and great exhibitions!
"August 7, 2019","The National Gallery allows everyone to see a stunning permanent collection and also offers a fantastic exhibitions in it's Sainsbury wing. Weekends tend to be quite busy, but still manageable. There are also tours and talks organised by the Gallery and they have always been of quite a high standard. I would highly recommend not only visiting the Gallery itself, but also trying to catch one of these tours (times and dates are usually available on the Gallery's website). ",Complicated layout but amazing collection
"August 7, 2019","The National Gallery houses some really key pieces of artwork by the famous and not so famous.  Highlights for me were the collections of Monet, Ruebens, Rembrandt, van Gogh and Constable. I'm not a huge fan of iconography but loved the collection  of early works (13th to 15th century) as I marvel at how they were made and have survived.Cafe was good and reasonable prices.Gift shop okWe went on a Monday in the school holidays and it was not too busy at all.",perfect afternoon
"August 7, 2019",we had a great time checking out the gallery. its huge with many rooms and styles of art. its an amazing way to spend a rainy afternoon in london without breaking the bank.,Absolutely Stunning - gets 11/10 from me
"August 7, 2019","Words fail me so I wont use many. Absolutely stunning place - room after room of masterpieces - too many to take them all in. There are not many reasons for living in London that I can see, but an easy and free access to the National Gallery would be one of them. Why do we have so much concentrated in one place? Why not take some Art to other cities - one room at a time would be quite enough! Let people appreciate what and how much we have! It was a tiring but an astonishing visit. A MUST GO PLACE.",National Gallery 
"August 7, 2019","A fabulous collection of art, you could spend a few hours or a few days here.  We were able to appreciate the Italian and French collections in a couple of hours, but could have easily spent the entire day if our schedule accommodated.",A must go to when visiting London
"August 7, 2019","I love this gallery, there so much to see and worth visiting to see the old masters and the gallery shop has quality products to buy and not tourist junk",Big and full of arts
"August 7, 2019","We have been lots of arts museums around the world, particularly in Europe before we visited National Gallery.  So we don’t feel way too excited.  However, the gallery itself does showcase works and artists very well.  ",The best place to relax
"August 7, 2019",I absolutely love the National Gallery. It is breathtaking and best place to just relax your body and mind.,Very wide
"August 7, 2019","You have to prepareb 2-3 hours to see all rooms!  Sometimes, so many group tours from Asian countries.  Therefore please visit there in the morning!",Popped in as passing by 
"August 7, 2019",Wandering around Trafalgar square and popped in to waste a few hours.  Worth a visit. Lots of amazing paintings ,Short and Sweet
"August 6, 2019","Time was against by the time we made it here. However, in a very short time we were able to gaze at the wonderful portraits and painting by Caravaggio, which we so badly wanted to see!!!  Highly recommended.",a must if you visit London
"August 6, 2019",Is one of the greatest museums in London! I went to an exhibition of tapestry that they had for free and it was incredible! ,Afternoon visit
"August 6, 2019",A great museum and is it free. The interior is spacious and air conditioned. There is a restaurant on the top floor with a good view of London skyline.,I love this place
"August 6, 2019","While the venue is free to visit, there is a suggested donation. I love to pop in and most of the time I will give a donation, but it's not strictly required and every few times I go for ""free"". There are some amazing pieces of art here, it is def a world class gallery and while the lay out can be a bit confusing for a first time, it's definitely worth giving your self some time to wonder around all the different areas. Personal favourites are Whistlejacket and Lake Keitele which are helpfully not far from each other. If you like art, this is a must!! ",Art!!!
"August 6, 2019",Art!!! If you're a art fan this is the place/ You can literally get lost in this place as I did. I went to see Flemish art and wasn't disappointed!,Inspirational
"August 6, 2019","First time here, free entry, overwhelming really! So many great works to see, well laid out exhibitions, plenty of wall signs telling you which works to expect in which gallery. Truly inspirational.",A morning in London

"August 5, 2019","By all means, when in London, check the museums! They are free, they are fabulous, and great for all ages. I found my teenager was sneaking out, to visit a favorite piece of art. So was I! An artists haven; bring your sketch pad!",London Trip
"August 5, 2019","Really enjoyed seeing original paintings by famous artists.  Many not so famous artists had wonderful work as well.  Quite a variety of styles and mediums.  Spent about 90 minutes, but could do more or less time.  You can always come back too because it's free!",One full day sinked into the art
"August 5, 2019","We decided to spend here a couple of hours on a monday morning.we stayed there from 10 am to 1 pm, then another couple of hours in the afternoon.Wonderful structure and really well presented masterpieces.Not so crowded.Really a must for a trip in Lodon",did think l would like it

"July 24, 2019",What n outstanding collection. And free entry. Not like the New Tate that cost a fortune to see the special exhibits.,Superb exhibitions - all free
"July 24, 2019","Wonderful, well known paintings ranging from the Renaissance to Impressionists. Some very famous artists. All free though a donation of £10 is recommended. You could spend hours here.",Take your time
"July 24, 2019",A stones throw from Trafalgar Square You need plenty of time to looked at all pictures on several floors.  Staff are very helpful and can answer most questions. Cafe has snacks and hot and cold drinks and there is also a restaurant. It is free admission but a donation is asked for.,maybe I just don't like visual art
"July 23, 2019","Admittedly, I am not a big fan of visual art.  I would much rather learn about the history or significance of a piece, or how it was made than hear speculation about what the artist was thinking or what something in the painting may or may not symbolize.  I rented an audioguide hoping to glean some of the information that would be interesting to me, but all the audioguide does is give you a description of the painting you are standing in front of. ",Worth the effort
"July 23, 2019","We hadn't planned on going in but stumbled upon it while looking for some time to get inside because of the heat. So we spent some time here.This was interesting and unique but not totally my cup of tea. We spent an hour there just to cool off, and it was good, but not something that I'd spend a lot more time at. More avid art fans would love it.",Highlight of our London visit
"July 23, 2019",The number of amazing paintings is underestimated in publications about this gallery.  We were tripping over masterpieces that went unmentioned in our research.  I guess there are just too many!  I am embarassed that this was not our first stop.  A must-see!,Fabulous collection
"July 22, 2019","Amazing collection, viewed the old masters and the Impressionists, but you could spend the entire week there and not run out of things to see!  ",One of the best ways to spend time in London
"July 22, 2019","There are so many wonderful paintings inside the museum, this place in unbelievable... Even without the paintings, the museum looks like a palace inside! Also, the place can be quite busy on the last days of December... Still, less than the main shopping streets :)",Wonderful!
"July 22, 2019","Wonderful gallery containing the original paintings of so many famous artists, including loads of paintings you will have seen in books and on TV/online. I particularly loved the Impressionists, and Constable and Turner, though there are so many you will find something you like, whatever your taste.It can get extremely busy, so it may pay to go early or late to try to avoid the crush - it is difficult to get close to some works, e.g. Van Gogh's Sunflowers.There is a cafe and toilets, and some seating in the lobby where you can wait for friends to join you or have a rest. You may find, like me, that you cannot see it all in a day, unless you rush around.",Superb
"August 2, 2019",If you are visiting with a limited amount of time you should plan your visit to pick out the key paintings you want to see. Be prepared for it to be busy in the holidays.,a must for everyone

"July 31, 2019","Loved this place. So much to see - paintings and also architecture. There are many enjoyable details in the interior also. As I am a Finn, it was also nice to see a painting from a Finnish artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela. Also my favorite artists and new ones too.This place is easy to find. Jus take time enough because you'll need when wondering thouht all the rooms. Lots of people and it works anyway.",As always: amazing!
"July 30, 2019","Fantastic collection. The entrance is free, but I would recommend a small donation. Number of Rembrands is amazing. It is sometimes difficult to find your way, despite all efforts to indicate where you are etc. ",Amazing Paintings
"July 30, 2019","The Gallery is a pretty confusing place to get around but the paintings are exquisite.  My favorites were three Rembrants – Belshazzar’s Feast (the Babylonian King looks up to the sky and sees written in the clouds the Hebrew letters that tell him that his days are numbered since he has misused a sacred cup from the old temple), Rembrandt’s self-portrait at the age of 63, two Vermeers, including one of a young woman playing the piano, the impressionists as usual, and the special exhibit of Sorola’s painting which were rich, vibrant and full of life.",Classic Visit

"July 19, 2019","The breadth of the collection at the National is staggering. From medieval through to early 20th century art this gallery has it all. There are galleries with collections that are more 'focussed' and comprehensive of certain periods (the Prado in Madrid is undoubtedly the place to see El Greco or Goya for example), but no where in the world will take you on such a journey through art as the National. The building itself is a treasure, the mosaics in the halls are amazing tongue in cheek nods to the moral values of the Victorians If you haven't been. Go.If you haven't been for a while. Go again. remind yourself of this truly awe inspiring art collection.I genuinely feel that the National Gallery is the best art gallery in the Western World",One of my favourite places in London
"July 19, 2019",Could spend the whole day at the gallery with the amount of art they have. Massive collection of art which I always enjoy from different periods ,Great Art in a Grand Setting!
"July 19, 2019",I loved visiting the National Gallery in London and plan to visit again the next chance I get.  Admission was free; a donation was requested.  The Renaissance art is phenomenal.  They have a room filed with Rembrandts.  The Impressionists are also nicely represented.,Stunning and amazing experience to see art
"July 18, 2019",I took an art history class in college and enjoyed it but there’s something amazing seeing it in person. You can get up close to all the pieces and really experience them. We did a quick 1 hour private tour of the key pieces which I’d highly recommend otherwise you could spend all day there. It’s a free gallery so crowds form at the key pieces but it’s manageable. ,Gorgeous Masterpieces ❤️
"July 18, 2019","Great place in the heart of Trafalgar Square! Admission is free, you may enjoy roaming through all the halls and fall in love with the world’s most beautiful works of art😍",Great museum and it is free!
"July 18, 2019","We took the audio tour, it was well worth it, it took you from 1200to 1930, we went from room to room, looked for the particular painting and listened to a brief explanation. What was nice to see is that every painting was on the audio tour, so you can come back and listen to the commentaries on other painting, in other words, you can never get tired of the museum.Not to be missed, great selection of paintings",Pretty good museum
"July 18, 2019","The fact that it's free entry is a massive plus. But because of it, it attracts anyone and everyone. Loses the ""quietness"" of other museums. Decent enough artwork and collections to pass a few hours. ",Great
"July 17, 2019","Amazing collection + Free entrance.Lots of amazing paitings, and it never feels crowded.It´s a no brainer, GO THERE NOW!!!",Amazing! Free
"July 17, 2019",Have what you want to see in mind! We just did the impressionists and it took less than an hour! Make a small donation!,Gets crowded but worth it
"August 5, 2019","Free to wander about. Next year while visiting I am definitely take a tour. There is so much too see, that I feel like I wasted precious time as I was somewhat unorganized.",Free admission is the best part of this attraction
"August 5, 2019","An unusually cool and rainy day in London during late May 2019 made visiting the National Gallery more enjoyable, however viewing paintings didn’t give me the same feeling as seeing London architecture, as such I spent a total of 20 minutes inside the National Gallery before leaving.  There is no cost at the National Gallery, free admission is the best part of this attraction.","Wow, never thought I would enjoy it so much"
"August 5, 2019","What a great gallery. Loads of well known paintings and nice and cool in the heat of the summer. It was packed when we visited, so sometimes difficult to get close to some paintings but persevering prevailed ",An impressive art collection

"August 4, 2019","Whether your an art lover or simply want to engage with london culture , this is the place for you. would not be quick to recommend for families with long children as they will most likely become bored rather quickly. ",Well worth a visit
"August 4, 2019","I'll be honest and admit that - as I was with an avowed non-art lover - we only went in to get out of the searing heat on the hottest day of the year but ended up spending a really enjoyable few hours.We wandered round without an audio guide (although these seemed reasonably priced) and loved stumbling across 'the big hits' (helped by the '30 must sees' listed on the web-site).A word on the web-site...it really is excellent and I spent a couple of hours after the visit browsing, watching some of the great videos etc. A fantastic resource.We're not great at organised tours although stumbled across guides giving talks on paintings at various points and listened in for a while, finding them really entertaining and informative.Overall, well worth a visit and - of course - absolutely free!",Short and Sweet

"July 27, 2019","Flying out late on Friday afternoon, I made time to check out the National Gallery having missed it on previous visits. Some stunning galleries, lots of famous artwork - all in all a wonderful way to spend an hour or two or three. Briefly visited the canteen - feel free to give it a miss unless you're in dire need of a drink  - but otherwise first class. ",Great Collection 
"July 27, 2019",So much to see. The thing I love best is that the guards are so knowledgeable about the artwork. Talk to the guards. ,Inspiring Art

"July 27, 2019","Great place to stop in for a 2-3 hour visit.  Lots to see and admire, large selection of Italian art as well as many others.

"July 27, 2019",I often come her to admire the paintings and I love that you can go at your own pace.  There are plenty of seats in front of some of the most incredible paintings. You see all sorts of people and you can watch them too.  Staff are always  helpful.,Great afternoon

It is morning or afternoon well spent looking at these treasures.",Sorolla 5*
"July 24, 2019","Unforgettable, mesmerizing, those sunlights... the paintings of Spanish artist Sorolla are the unique I have ever seen.",Special Experience
"July 11, 2019","Had a fabulous time here- crucial visit for art lovers and honestly for anyone else. it's free in and you're allowed to take photos of most of the artwork without the flash on, but be aware that videos are not allowed- I had to put my go-pro away. While some of the older art can feel very much the same and monotonous to the untrained eye, the later impressionist galleries can be truly appreciated by everybody and you can see that from the crowds in them. To walk around a room and see a Van Gogh, a Monet, a Renoir and a Degas- it's a very special experience. And considering it's all for free, if you're anywhere near Trafalgar Square and have a spare hour or two, considering taking a donder though here.",The best art gallery ever

"July 10, 2019","The National Gallery is known as an attraction in its own right. However, I'm there all the time, for work, and it's a great place to get drinking water, use the toilet for free, and sit down! There's a toilet on the first floor with drinking water just outside. It is totally free and of course this is one of the greatest things about  visiting Britain -it might be expensive but lots of stuff is free.",Overdue visit

"July 3, 2019","The collection of masterpieces is simply stunning. Also impressive is the accessibility. A meagre brass footrail (and in some places, hordes of school children) are all that stand between you and the European masters. And it's free!",Marvel at Masterpieces
"July 3, 2019","I could have spent several days and more time at the National Gallery.  Even the teen in our group was impressed!  But for a reason I didn't even know!  As soon as we walk in to the first gallery he announces ""I know this place!""  Never having been to London I had to ask how.  The National Gallery is in a scene of the James Bond movie Skyfall.  The paintings have been rearranged but he was excited to see the room and the paintings.I was slightly disappointed to find that ""Sunflowers"" by Vincent van Gogh was not available for viewing.Definitely crowded but worth the visit to see some of the best artists in history: Michelangelo, Raphael, Diego Velázquez, Monet...so much to see, so little time.If historical art work is your passion, plan an all day visit.  And don't forget to check events for surprises including hands on experiences.The staff was very helpful as I had to ask where the ""James Bond"" paintings were.  Never did I think I would ask that question in a Gallery filled with historical greats. ",Lots to see!

"July 3, 2019",The National Gallery has one of the most amazing art collections in the world and is one of the most beautiful as well.

"July 3, 2019","Some of the most beautiful galleries! Bee lined to some Da Vinci and Rembrandt pieces! It does get a little crowded but worthwhile! If you don't have time to get through it all, their website does offer a list of the top 30 paintings to see which is what we did.",Amazing!
"July 3, 2019","Easily the best collection of paintings in the Uk. The masterpieces of the Italian painters are some of the finest outside Italy. If you would like to see Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, Caravaggio in the same collection, the NG is a must!",Free but crowded
"July 3, 2019","We only had 30 minutes so we went straight to the Cezanne and Degas gallery. Because entry is free it gets very busy with large groups of kids, with a fascination for taking photos of every painting!

"July 14, 2019",lots of famous paintings in this museum.worth visiting for everyone.a beautiful square in front of the museum.,Stunning Sorolla Exhibition
"July 13, 2019","This Exhibition at the National Gallery is hands down my favourite art exhibition in London this year. An unexpected treat that was beautifully curated and cannot be recommended highly enough. The artist Sorolla, also known as The Master of Light painted huge canvases filled with vivid portraits of daily life in His country Spain and other parts of the Mediterranean. There is still time to see the beautiful work of this hugely underrated artist. Not to be missed!",Fabulous Sorolla Exhibition
"July 13, 2019","We came to the National Gallery for the exhibition of paintings by the Spanish artist Joaquin Sorolla.

"July 12, 2019",We visit the National Gallery as often as we can. We just love walking around and admire the great painters and their fantastic works. Admission is free. ,Almost an unfair rating
"July 11, 2019","Okay so let me put this out here. We were a group of two adult children and our mother and this was a stop for an hour or two among people who don't necessarily have a passion for art. The museum is gorgeous, the collection is extensive, and it's free. It would have been really helpful (and probably was available somewhere that we didn't find) to have had a ""highlights"" type of program or tour so that we could see some famous pieces, learn a bit about others, and then move along. Instead we kind of wandered from room to room and never really got into anything. This is probably our fault and there's no doubt this is a lovely museum but it wasn't our highlight.",Good tenke
"July 11, 2019","After a gallery visit we popped in for tea and cake.The service  was bit haphazard although there were plenty  of staff around.Tables not being cleared quickly, that sort of thing. Cakes and tea good though. Tea served in a huge pot. Excellent value.",Free talks are great

"July 2, 2019","While everyone always thinks of the British Museum when it comes to London, they shouldn't forget about the National Gallery, which is without a doubt on the same level in its own genre.With free admission (though donations are encouraged), the National Gallery offers hours of enjoyment with an expansive collection of paintings. The setting is excellent, and the building really offers the right kind of context for enjoying such a fine selection that stretches through several centuries.With both great architecture and art, you can't really go wrong by choosing to spend three or four hours here.",First trip to London
"July 2, 2019",Traveling with my elderly sister they had a wheelchair ready for us and we spent several hours browsing wonderful works of art from all schools and time periods. Lots of seating available to sit and rest the feet or just gaze at a painting. The gift shop is very good.,One of the World's Top Class Museums
"July 2, 2019","It can't be missed. While gigantic, it is also ok to choose a few rooms and enjoy them.  If you are a real art lover, be sure to leave yourself plenty of time.  It is a world class museum which one could keep visiting one's whole life and still not be finished.",Excellent art collection
"July 2, 2019",Take your time viewing this wonderful collection of art over the centuries.  It offers a wide variety of examples of styles and methods.  A must see museum!,Good stop
"July 2, 2019",The National Gallery and Portrait Gallery make for a great back to back stop. The National Gallery contains many of the great masters. The Van Goghs in particular were a highlight for us.,Amazing! 
"July 7, 2019","Thw National Gallery is a magical place. The art is simply exquisite, there is something for every taste. You could get lost, spend hours and hours. Always free entrance. Amazing. ",Italian Renaissance
"July 7, 2019","Recently I went with a group of friends to see the Italian paintings at the National Gallery. Although I live in London and have visited the Gallery many times it doesn't stop to surprise me. Every time I go it's as if I am there for the first time and the Italian paintings have something special about them. If you have time, I recommend going. It's one of those things that has to be done, though it might be a Marmite story.",A great haven in Trafalgar Square
"July 7, 2019",I am a regular at the National Gallery when I am in London-- my favorite museum there. This restaurant is a great place to take a break before venturing on to more museum or out to Trafalgar Square and beyond. Service is excellent and the food is very good.,amazing Place
"July 7, 2019",Went to London with my Gran-daughters  and this was our favorite Place. Great to visit National Gallery  ,One of my favorite museums in London
"July 6, 2019","It is an excellent museum, obviously. My main advice: take one of the free guided tours. Did this once and was blown away. The tour guide had a PhD in art history, was clearly into the topic and showed us a selection of five key paintings. The tour went for around two hours and it was the best visit of a museum I ever had.",wonderful views from the cafe and great place to loose a few hours
"July 5, 2019",The cafe looks over the london skyline and is a hidden gem.  The galleries are full of iconic and historic painting that you can wanter through for hours on end,Must Do!
"July 5, 2019","Located just by Trafalgar Square this gallery offers free admission.  We were there when it opened, so did not deal with any lines of people, just walked right in. A good variety of paintings that should suit all tastes.  Take some time in your schedule to stop by this wonderful gallery.  ",Lap it up and please donate
"July 4, 2019","Such an encyclopaedia of art work. Something for every taste and so many different experiences.Put aside at least half a day to wander around this great example of free, yes free, hospitality and entertainment. To use a pun, its a feast of art and culture that only places such as this can serve up.Enough of the hairy fairy stuff, this is really one of the cultural experiences you must visit in London.  :)Enjoy and donate so everybody else can keep enjoying after you've been",Fantastic
"July 4, 2019","We hadn’t planned on visiting but we were walking by and it was an admission free day so we decided to go in. It was fantastic. We’ve been to multiple museums in the US, Greece and France. This one was as equally impressive, having works from not only the masters like Leonardo Da Vinci, Caravaggio and Rafael, but impressionista like Monet and Renoir, and several Van Gogh paintings. It was wonderful. ",A Must Do!
"July 4, 2019","The collection is intense and rich. The audioguide is quite well done, though frequent volume adjustments are necessary. Works seem to be moved often making it hard to find certain works or to follow a pre-arranged plan. There appears to be only one docent-led tour a day and it covers only a few highlights, so be sure not to miss it. With the purchase of the audio guide, you can get a listing of the 40 or so most well known Masterworks in the collection. It will take half a day to find each of those, and listen to the accompanying audioguide, but I found that the most productive way to visit, even though about 15% of the works were not in the rooms identified on the guide. Most of the room security personnel were familiar enough with the plan to be able to point you to rooms where items had been moved.Guards will begin moving you out of rooms at about 20 to 15 minutes before closing time, but they do so in a fairly gentle and respectful way. ""This way, m'love"" is not such a bad way to be herded!Temperature from room to room was good and the almost-adequate number of benches throughout the galleries was appreciated. ",So many Monets
"July 2, 2019",I am a huge fan of Monet and other Impressionists.  It was so great to see so many.  I was a bit disappointed that the Van Gough Sunflowers painting was moved to a different museum.,So much better than the Louvre!!
"July 2, 2019",If you are taking a European trip to see art this is a must see.  We spent a day here and could have stayed much longer.  The museum is not over crowded.  It is also quiet and has a lovely cafe inside.  The art will knock your socks off.  Security was quick and efficient.  If you are debating here or the Louvre be sure to come here.  The difference in your experience of the art is 100% better.,Broad collection very well presented.
"July 2, 2019","Although entrance is free a donation of 10 £, $ or € is recommended and the visit more than justifies it. The collection is logically laid out with clear signage enabling either a focused visit or a more leisurely browse through the ages. Headphones are available for £5 although most of the signage is informative. The collection is extremely broad with an excellent representation of artists, styles and periods.A great way to pass a few hours. Highly recommended. ",Stunning works you must see
"July 2, 2019",Best single artist exhibition in years. His use of light is amazing and capture of movement quite astonishing. Other remarkable feature is range of compositions.,Truelly magnificent masterpieces.......
"July 2, 2019","The National Gallery in London houses a vast collection of I international art from all the great masters, we particularly wanted to see John Constables The Haywagon and it did not dissapoint. From Monet, Picasso, Sisley and all the greats to an amazing collection of Byzantine religious art there is something for everyone. Located in Trafalgar square its good to get there at opening time as it gets very crowded around midday. Great gift shop too to take home a special memory. *****",lovely as always
"July 1, 2019","come here all the time, favourite place in london. especially when youre low on funds. cant wait to come back again",Outstanding in every way.
"July 1, 2019",Very nice museum. A must-see if you are in London for more than a day or two. The paintings are right out of your old art history textbook.,always visit
"July 1, 2019",when I'm in London I always try to make sure that I stop here for at least a quick visit. I believe that they close late on Wednesdays,Outside the National Gallery 06.07.19 14.00 Stand Up for Assange Protest
"June 30, 2019","A great place for a protest outside the National Gallery.  Stand Up for Julian Assange 6th July 2019 14.00. is another opportunity to participate. This is a wide open space and so it will offer lots of room for protesting. The last protest there on 01/06/19 looked great, however the space could accommodate loads more people!",- Our first stop in London-
"June 30, 2019",-There is something for everyone at the National gallery.There are audio tours & worth going in for the lovers & students of Art.,Lots to see
"June 22, 2019",Best if you prefer older paintings.  If you're trying to find a specific and are using a travel guidebook  you might not find it as they move paintings around.,Check out National Gallery ‘London. 
"June 22, 2019",Weekend was nice and warm so off we went to London just to look around town stopped off at this Gallery It was a eye opener ‘ a lot to take in and the Gallery was busy. Free to get in and look around. It is a great place to visit I saw some fantastic paintings and will have to go back to take more in.Rubens’ Rembrandt’ & Vincent Van’Gogh’ have some great works just hanging around. They have a great coffee area and good gift shop.  When in there take a-bit of time and just look up at the gold paint work just stunning over head in one of the great hall rooms. ,Surprisingly delightful!
"June 22, 2019","Decided to stop in as a last minute plan with my boyfriend and we were pleasantly surprised! We didn't know what to expect, but it was free so we decided to check it out. It is so worth it! For starters, it's a beautiful building and the staff there are very friendly and helpful. The portraits they have are BEAUTIFUL! I was so surprised that they had pieces from Van Gogh, Monet, and more. We stayed for about 45-minutes and got to see a decent chunk of it. I definitely recommend stopping in, only if it's for a short amount of time. ",Great place to view London
"June 22, 2019","We visited the pier, but chose not to ride. The  line was long and the ride is very slow. We had quite a few other places we wanted to see. The view from the eye is probably spectacular with its location on the Thames right across from Big Ben and other landmarks. ",National gallery
"June 21, 2019","This gallery is free to visit, it is a quite place, with a selection of art work to see, the souvenir shop has a great variety of product at reasonable prices. Visited in Feb half term wasn't to busy. ",Art lovers paradise
"June 21, 2019","This is one of the great art galleries of Europe and has so many paintings that it is a bit difficult to absorb in one go, but as it is free, a visit can be split into 2 or more visits. Arranged by time periods which makes it easy to comprehend and identify the styles. As with many of the famous galleries, some of the best known artists underwhelm, but others hardly known are superb! Others deserve their reputation! Not really a place for young kids as not much to capture and hold their attention.",Always wonderful
"June 21, 2019","I've been there before and loved it, but this was a first visit for my friend, who loves Turner. She was delighted to find a number   of his pictures among the gallery's enormous collection of wonderful pictures. We also liked a nearby room with an exhibit of some of the gallery's newest exhibits and Holbein's painting of ""The Ambassadors."".And we had rest, relaxation, and some nice nibbles in the restaurant in the Sainsbury wing of the gallery. Quite quiet and peaceful the afternoon we were there.Don't miss the gallery's main shop on the ground floor of the Sainsbury wing. My friend is delighted with  her scarf in the green, violet, and white colors of the suffrage movement.",Visited on a Saturday
"June 21, 2019",Found the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square. Very busy as a weekend. We left our coats and shopping at the cloakroom which is ideal as it means you feel more comfortable walking around. There are different options for touring around but we downloaded an app which was brilliant for identifying a picture and some information surrounding it. This app is called Art Smartify. It is free and you just aim it at the picture keep it in between the lines and hey presto! The info comes up. All the paintings are stored to look at again. So many paintings from religious art to the Impressionists. Probably one of the most famous hanging in The National Gallery is Sunflowers by Van Gogh. My favourite painter Monet is there. The gift shop is very good. ,One for Culture Vultures 
"June 21, 2019","Free entry, amazing place to visit for lovers of fine art. So much to look at - go early to avoid the crowds. My favourites included 18th century British Art, Dutch Art & the Leonardo paintings. Cafeteria & shop on site. ",Great artwork
"June 21, 2019",One of the countries best art galleries. A bit too much modern garbage but it's easy to avoid those rooms and stick with the grand masters and the other real art,Inspirational
"February 25, 2019","Caravaggio, Picasso, cezanne, monet, van eyk, da Vinci, Vermeer, Rembrandt, turner and many many more... a maze of amazing works. Just don’t trip over the super annoying packs of visitors in guided tours. ",A great way to spend a couple of hours
"February 25, 2019","This art gallery was great. It was very interesting to see all of these brilliant paintings. They were beatifully preserved/restored and displayed to show their magnificence. One of the things which was a shame was that the ‘sunflowers’ painting was very crowded (as to be expected as it is small) which makes it difficult to view from a good angle if you aren’t prepared to push your way to the front - which many people did quite rudely. Do not miss Stubbs’ horse painting ‘Whistlejacket’. It was stunning and you cannot understand the scale unless you see it in real life. The trip could’ve been improved if parents kept their bored children under control, or even better took them to an age appropriate attraction. Once a three year old has seen a painting, they have seen them all and sadly just become a nuisance to everyone else. ",Nice Collections
"February 25, 2019","Amazing collections of artwork. Must go and it is free. Be aware of many tourists and wear comfortable shoes. Depend if you believe in spiritual world, this is the only place in London for my weeklong trip I had a bad headache before I went to the Gallery. However, headache disappear when I walked out the Gallery. This is a place full of history, so if you are sensitive recommend to avoid.",All this and its free!
"February 25, 2019","Visited the National Gallery at 5.00pm on Saturday, worrying that it would be closed but it is open until 6.00. So, one hour to enjoy this extraordinary place.  I don't have words to express the wonders of this gallery - I tried to see ten amazing pictures - but hardly knew where to start.  Helpful staff directed me to Da Vinci, Caravaggio, Canaletto, Constable, Turner, Van Gogh, Monet.  Like a box of chocolates!  Wonderful!  And I didn't have to pay a single penny to see these masterpieces.  ",A must see
"February 25, 2019",If you are an art lover visiting London don’t miss this or the national portrait gallery next door.  A huge well curated collection and lots of hidden gems.  Pretty decent cafe too,Make sure you've got comfy shoes on
"February 25, 2019",The gallery is huge and full of trasures. It is woth to go there but be aware of the large groups of tourists as it can get crowded. ,Must See!
"February 24, 2019","Free admission into this lovely gallery.   Go early as line ups can be long.   Excellent art gallery, a great opportunity to see some of the classics.",good

"February 24, 2019","All staff was helpful ,no exveptionsMagnificent collection of arts .Had a tea at the cafe,the waiter recommended me the tea and he was right I loved it",Always a classic
"February 24, 2019","We’ve been visiting the National Gallery with our three daughters since they were tiny (they’re triplets, now almost ten). We particularly enjoy the galleries featuring Turner, Monet, Rousseau, Stubbs, Seurat et al as so many of the paintings feature in the ‘Katie’ series of books by James Mayhew. As an aside, I would highly recommend this series; they have inspired a love of art galleries in our daughters and an inclination to imagine what adventures they’d have in the various paintings we see.  Through we needed to temper this enthusiasm when aged four one of the girls tried to jump into Seurat’s ‘the Bathers’ and terrified the poor security guard on duty! ",Amazing
"February 24, 2019",Incredible museum full of amazing art worth seeing at least once in your lifetime. Highly recommended. ,Great museum
"February 24, 2019",If you love art don’t miss it!!a great museum!! You have so many things to see!! Great location!!Imposing building!!,Artsy
"February 24, 2019",Lots of street performers. Lots of groups taking selfies.Be mindful when walking as you can get bumped.,Great service and a wonderful view!
"February 24, 2019","I stopped here for a light lunch with my husband and thoroughly enjoyed it. The service was respectful but not over fussy, the food tasty and unpretentious, and very good value. Mostly, I loved the view over the rooftops in London.",TOP NOTCH!!!!
"February 23, 2019","All I can say is this is the classiest thing you can do...Van Gogh, DaVinci, Renoir and more. You can spend a day inside.Take your time and let it all soak in...gorgeous inside and out. I go on every trip and cannot get enough. i love that they keep it all 'fresh' with new items on loan and other special exhibits. It is FREE but they ask for donations in drop box/wells around the museum. They should charge for what you see...just think, you are 3' away from priceless items...some worth tens of millions of dollars...gives me the chills. It is a beautiful thing to take in...enjoy. My favorite, ALL VAN GOGH! ",One of the great galleries of the world
"February 23, 2019",The finest collection of paintings after the Louvre. Very strong on the Italian renaissance and Northern European pictures. Less Impressionism than there should be....but that's the fault of earlier directors.,It was Okay
"February 21, 2019","I am not really a big fan of museums, but I came here with my friend.  It was okay and lots too see, but very busy and crowded by loads of people.  Also lots of school groups.  ",A classic for the classics
"February 21, 2019","Whether you are an art fan or not, you will like this place. It has all the names you'd recognise. Leonard Da Vinci, Picasso, Rembrandt, Vermeer and many many more. The key to this place is the atmosphere. A few hours of peace out away from busy Trafalgar Square, which is right outside. With so many exhibits, that you have time to take a moment or two to consider each piece without feeling like a hundred other people are on your shoulder doing the same thing. Each painting has a little note with it, detailing the artist, the history and story behind the painting too. It isn't much, but just enough to be able to absorb it, understand it, and bring the painting a little more to life, and to inspire you to find out more about it.If you love art in any way, make sure to come here for a day :)",Amazing art gallery and free
"February 21, 2019","The British do so much so brilliantly! Having been to many other art galleries worldwide, they don't compare. Such a range of magnificent pieces, so well displayed, with each labelled with a description. There are benches everywhere for you to sit and enjoy the art. They have money, Van Gogh, constable, turner and so much more. Being free to enter is amazing although they ask for donations of course. Lots of toilets, cafes and shops. A real treat, especially good on a rainy day! ",A plethora of fine art. Take your time to view!
"February 21, 2019","We had a couple of spare hours so decided to visit the National Gallery.  Wow! Room after room of fabulous art from literally hundreds of artists of all genres.  I was finally able to understand why people rave about JM Turner's use of light in his skies after standing in front of his 'The Fighting Temeraire'.  Although the religious and biblical paintings had less interest for me, there were some famous works there that did catch the eye, but my favourite was the massive portrait of Whistlejacket which was so beautiful you felt as if the animal could just leap off the wall and gallop off in front of you.",Spur of the moment visit and glad I did
"February 21, 2019","My wife was busy in London so I decided to visit the gallery as had always been interested in visiting, im definitely glad I finally got to take in the breathtaking artwork. If visiting I would definitely say give yourself plenty of time for this stunning attraction.",Must visit!

"February 20, 2019","I like to,spend only 1-2 hours at a museum, see a limited amount and come again. You could spend a week here. The collection is extensive. This visit I enjoyed rooms devoted to late 19th century. The museum is arranged so wel its easily to find what you want to see. The staff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable. The rooms are large and paintings displayed so they are easy to see and enjoy. Whatever period or genre of art you and enjoy it here.",The best in the World

"February 19, 2019",Large collection of art through the centuries. Recommend concentrating on impressionists and 18th century. ,"Wonderful holdings, so much to see, so good!"
"June 2, 2019","My wife and I visited this fabulous gallery around 2pm on a Saturday in April 2019.  The holdings here are unbelievable and it was a delight to walk the galleries, encountering one treasure after another.  There are paintings you will recognize instantly, including huge painted altarpieces and other delights.  There is superior sculpture.  We spent just over 2 hours here, and that was not enough.  It was what our end-of-a-week-of-tourist-walking feet could handle.  More rested, we think 3-4 hours would be better.  We left a $20 donation, and, at that, this was still a great value.  We saw the Tate Britain and the Tate Modern and those two museums combined don’t equal this one.  If you are only visiting one art museum during your time in London, make this the one!",A nice indoor diversion 
"June 2, 2019",We came in from the rain and marvel at the variety and quality of the collection. Plus friendly docent helped guide us. ,The museum to go if you love art or want a glimpse of it
"June 1, 2019","*** Tips included here ***It's free and huge, you can spend there few hours or less, depends on how much you like to see art.The museum has wonderful paintings from all eras, famous artists, known paintings and many other treasures. If you like classic art, it's the place for you, no doubts.Entrance: pay attention that sometimes the entry is from the left side of the museum which means from Sainsbury Wing and not from Trafalgar directly.  Crowd: There are always many people, doesn't matter when you come, cause it's a great place to get your art portion. However, you can see the paintings peacefully, don't worry about that. Eating: the museum has a restaurant and a cheaper cafeteria where you can sit and eat in a nice atmosphere. Cloakroom: pay attention- each item you give them, coasts 2 pounds to keep.Photos: allowed, everybody take pictures there. Children: you can take your children, however try to look for activities related to them, it's a big museum and they might get tired after few hours unless you make few breaks for them.","Sorolla, Spanish Master of Light"
"June 1, 2019","What a wonderful exhibition  of works by Sorolla, the amazing Spanish artist who can capture light in his pictures like no other!  Well done National Gallery for staging this exhibition of his work, the first in Britain for a century.  It should do much to promote his reputation here.",One of the world's best cultural destinations
"June 1, 2019","Located at the very heart of London, looming impressively over Trafalgar Square, this is a must see attraction if visiting London. Being free, I used to pop in for 20 minutes when working near by. The building itself is extremely impressive, but the paintings on display are amongst the finest collections of art in the world. Can get bust with groups, but the gallery is large enough that you can try to navigate away from them and then reurn to the paitings you want to see.",Treasures
"June 1, 2019","We spent an afternoon at the National Gallery, a museum we have visited often, but not recently.While the organization of the galleries is still a bit difficult to decipher, the paintings are beautifully displayed and well lit.Unless you are a regular visitor, I would strongly recommend you rent the audio guide.",Always a sure bet
"May 31, 2019","Great place to visit as it holds a large number of terrific works from the likes of Cézanne, Constable, Monet, Degas, and Van Gogh. Free entry but well worth a donation.",Just One More Time
"May 31, 2019","The perfect museum experience if you can visit time & time again. I’m lucky to live near London, and I come to the BM nearly every time I come into London to meet friends later in the day.My concentration, and my feet, last for about 2 hours so today it was The Parthenon and a few extra bits. If you want to get the most of your visit, it’s worth reading the plaques in each of the exhibit rooms - unless you’ve invested in the headphones.There’s far too much to see if you’re here for just one visit, so my advice would be to have a look at the list of all the rooms & periods covered; then just focus on what appeals to you the most. There’s lots of restaurants and fast food places to eat nearby, so don’t feel obliged to eat in the museum restaurant if it’s rather crowded.Today it’s cool and raining a little, so the museum was packed: it’s free to enter (donations gratefully received) so you don’t feel guilty by leaving after just a couple of hours - like me!",Extraordinary place to visit
"May 31, 2019","The first thing to note about the gallery is that it is huge. We were keen to see a Da Vinci painting and were directed to gallery 66. That gives you some idea of the scale.We found the staff friendly and knowledgeable and with a sense of humour: when we asked an attendant if we could take a photo he said “Yes, where would you like me to stand”!The other impressive aspect as that despite admission being free, and being a public holiday, access was very easy and there were only minor queues.An interesting feature of the gallery is engagement with school children. Currently there is a display about children’s responses to a particular piece of artwork. A very clever idea.We only had a spare couple of hours but you could easily spend a day here.Highly recommended.",Always a great visit

"May 29, 2019","In all of our visits, we had never gone inside the National Gallery.  It takes up the entire north side of Trafalgar Square.  The building is just stunning.  It houses one of the finest collections of Western European paintings in the world from around 1250 onwards.  Its masterpieces include artworks from arts such as Botticelli, Titian, Raphael, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Cezanne, Hogarth, and Gainsborough.  The National Gallery was established for the benefit of all, not just the privileged.  It has always been committed to maintaining free admission as well as keeping a central London location with access for everyone.  Pay particular attention to the floors – the mosaics are exquisite and don’t miss the dome. We happened to be there when they had a small, but delightful exhibition by Boilly – Scenes of Parisians Life.  And, take the time to go around the corner and visit the National Portrait Gallery which is also free.",The best museum
"May 29, 2019","There is a lot of paintings and some rooms about oil paintings. Different rooms have different styles of oil painting, and each painting has its own characteristics. There are two paintings that interest me very much. One of the painting is a pink beach and a blue sea. When I saw it I felt very romantic.I went to the National Gallery by Bakerloo Line of Underground. I exited at Charing Cross station.

"June 7, 2019","Have walked past here many times and finally went in as had 30 minutes to spare before a dinner booking. What a revelation, lovely rooms, so relaxing just wandering from room to room looking at some amazing paintings! Will most definitely return",Great place!!!!
"June 7, 2019","Great collection of art!! I do recommend it. It is also worthwhile visiting the Portrait Gallery next to it. The gallery is very easy to be found in the heart of London. Nearest tube station is Charing Cross, but it’s also close to Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus.",National Gallery visit - excellent
"June 7, 2019",Well worth visiting - free entrance and lovely restaurant on the top floor.Of course the portrait exhibits are well worth viewing - priceless.,Awesome collection of internationally important works
"June 7, 2019","Great gallery, some amazing art , loverly settings and great location. Well worth spending a few hours browsing. Nothing like as packed as the Ufizi yet somewhat comparable levels of quality. ",A National Treasure
"June 6, 2019",An amazing place. Not only is the “permanent” collection awe inspiring but they put on outstanding exhibitions as well. The staff are helpful and the audio guides that accompany the exhibitions are very informative. I would recommend this place to everyone.,Great day
"June 6, 2019",Excellent way to pass an afternoon. Could spend a few days here if you were up to it. Free entry but a donation of 5 pound is suggested. Well worth a visit even if you have no interest in art.,A wWorld class Art Gallery in the heart of London
"June 6, 2019",A stunning world class selection of art. What's not to like? The breath of works is amongst the world's best. The rooms are large and airy which adds to the overall relaxed ambiance.For a quick visit to a whole day it's incredible.If there has to be a let down it's the catering offer. Only one premium priced outlet in house. However yfear not. Step outside for a selection and then step back in. Finally unlike most overseas Galleries it's FREE.,A National Treasure
"June 5, 2019","Great Collection. Free of Charge. masterpiecesGalleries flow well, and guards are helpful to guide one through ",Nice Place To Vist...
"February 12, 2019",Our trip to London would of been incomplete. if we didn't see the beauty of the National Gallery Museum. Amazing collection from all our the word.Highly Recommend this place.  ,Amazing
"February 12, 2019","The National Gallery is a 'must see' when you go to London. There are so many spectacular paintings here including one of VanGogh's Sunflowers. It's a huge place and can be overwhelming so just pick a few galleries that interest you most and visit them, and then go for a tea or lunch next door in the crypt of St. Michael's of the fields. It's a great way to spend a morning!",A must in London
"February 12, 2019",You can missed while in London especially it’s for free. Painting from all over the world. Great activity for a rainy day!,When you have 1h free...
"February 12, 2019","When you have 1h free and need a quiet moment fire yourself there’s no better place than NG to recharge your soul. From Leonardo to Monet it’s a beauty trip trough centuries and it’s real, not digital. Every time you can discover a different detail of your favorite picture. And it’s free!",A magical place
"February 12, 2019",With only a few days in london i had to revisit the National Gallery .A must place to visit even with limited time to spare . Its big and with so many works of art to see and admire there is always something new .Absolute must place to experience . Staff were friendly and helpful also ....just a perfect day overall.,Day out in London
"February 12, 2019",Lovely day out in London. Spent all afternoon wondering through National Gallery. Find this place peaceful and inspirational.,Never enough time!
"February 12, 2019","Even with a whole day, I don't think I would have felt I had enough time to take everything in. I didn't get through the entire collection, but what I did get through was magnificent. Prioritized my favorites, the impressionists, and could have spent hours more. Admission is free, though a donation is suggested, and I strongly recommend making it the priority for a day if you have the time!","Excellent, So So Much To See"
"February 12, 2019","National Gallery at Trafalgar's Square is FREE.  They do take donations.  There are several entrances.  I ended up in the group tour entrance by accident and there was no issue.  It was super crowded when I decided to visit (The Passion of Jesus production was taking place.)  While it was busy outside, inside was busy but quiet.  There is plenty of space to move around and see what you want to see.  I decided to purchase the audio guide (teacher discount, don't forget your id).  I highly encourage the audio guide, a lot of good information.  You could spend all day here maybe even days.","Fantastic experience, so many large rooms of paintings, a real treat."
"February 12, 2019","Spent a lovely afternoon here, lots of rooms full of paintings, amazing that there are such vibrant colours in such old paintings,however,  there are only so many Religious pics that you can look at in one day, so we did cut some of the visit short in order to move on to something more of our interest,  the George Stubbs 'Whistlejacket' is superb, could look at it all day!Many other fabulous works of art. Would go again..!",Art! Art! Art!
"February 12, 2019","Such an experience of the great artists of our lifetime.  So much too see and so little time.  Please map out and make time to experience everything.  And when you are done eat at the Crypt Café, something different to talk about to your friends back home.","Great location, lovely paintings"
"May 8, 2019",Right in Trafalgar Square so great location.  Its free to enter (a donation is optional) and the paintings are great.  Lots of famous artists and a lovely art gallery.,Some beautiful art and excellent tourguide
"May 8, 2019","I joined the 2 PM free public tour and the tourguide was very lively, engaging, and passionate about the artwork. The tour had about 30 adults and somehow my friend and I were quietly chatting when we were walking to the next art stop, and lost the entire group. Anyhow, not a problem as there were particular eras we really wanted to spend time with so we made our way to those spots and took our time there. Sound absorption acoustic-wise was not great so loud people, adults and children, detracted from my fuller enjoyment of this museum, but I suppose that cannot be helped. (?) Pleasant, sweet cafe staff.",No entrance fee for an amazing gallery
"May 8, 2019",A great gallery filled with everything in the world of art...........all the old masters as well as modern impressionists. Don't miss this national treasure.,For art lovers 
"May 8, 2019",If you are an art lover you will love it! The gallery exhibits many amazing and important paintings so it will take some time to see it all. If you don't have a lot of time just walk through the gallery and glance at all of its beauties. Another option is to do it in bits and pieces - see one part then come back the other day. It is free so it wouldn't be a problem to get back in.,If you need to escape from the craziness
"May 8, 2019","I will always be in love with the National Gallery. It has so many fond memories for me but my most treasured is when a VIP friend was visiting from overseas, We didn't have much cash to splurge and I wanted to show him round the city but didn't want the madness of Oxford Street and the like. Because he was an art lover I decided to take him to the NG. The rain outside made it an even better choice. We spent the afternoon in awe of all the magnificent paintings and totally lost ourselves in the atmosphere of the place. When we finally came out, it felt as if we had been in a strange time warp and were totally relaxed.I highly recommend this place if you need to escape from the madness of the city. I'm so grateful that places like this exist and the most wonderful thing is that it is still free of charge to get in. What more could you ask for! I would recommend this gallery to everyone.",Beautiful
"May 8, 2019",Most of the collection is free so you can enjoy at bit at a time. the national gallery also organised special exhibition and those are charged for. I went to see the Corolla one and it was fantastic. the paintings were great and set up fantastic as usual,Amazing Art Collection
"May 7, 2019","As with many museums, it is impossible to see everything even if you spend all day for several days.  There are many great pieces here so I'd suggest you check the internet for the top 10-20 ""must see"" pieces of art housed here.  With that info, you can easily plan your visit and at least not miss the most outstanding pieces.  Admission is free.  Front opens at Trafalgar Square where there are usually buskers playing and much going on. Across the small side street is St. Martins in the Field church and next to it is the National Portrait Gallery.  A nice way to spend a full day in this areas of London.",Beautiful works of art-fee free to jump around 
"May 7, 2019","This museum is gorgeous. The mosaic floor alone is worth a trip. If you have a personal preference in art periods, I’d recommend just jumping around to that gallery. ",love it!
"May 7, 2019","love the art gallery, free entry. some of the most amazing art pieces in the world can be found in there. enjoy thoroughly.",Iconic Building
"May 7, 2019","I go there whenever i can,always has some fantastic exhibitions on,also some nice areas to eat,i recently became a member which is very much worth doing.",Many Delights
"May 16, 2019","The National Gallery has a nice collection, a big collection, a developed collection.  However, it isn't huge (which makes it manageable) and no one aspect of the collection seems to dominate the others.  Just remember that the bulk of the British collection and the Modern collection have been moved to the two Tates, British and Modern respectively.  The Dutch masters and the Impressionists are most memorably represented, and the Renaissance collections will draw Monty Python fans to find ""the foot"" -- hint: it's in the lower left hand corner of the work opposite the entry to Room 8.  On the weight of this alone it is worth a trip to the museum.  While the floor plan isn't absolutely intuitive -- the building looks so balanced from the outside, but doesn't seem so inside -- the majority, if not the totality of the collection is on one floor.The espresso bar does a nice cuppa, but I might have thought that it would be more visually pleasing for an art gallery of this callibre.  Cafe lunch (self-serve) was not the absolute usual fare, but was a bit weary in quality, even by museum standards and the seating area is small (the espresso bar's seating seemed bigger) meaning that while others were lingering over brochures, the elderly members of my party were trying to balance themselves on high stools at the bar.  Overall, the cafe is not welcoming.Despite the lacking room in the cafe, the rest of the museum was not terribly busy here on a Sunday in May.  It was easy and pleasant to engage the art.  Overall, it was a good day trip, especially when combined with the National Portrait Gallery just steps away.",So much to see
"May 16, 2019",There is a great deal to see and very busy. It is often too crowded to appreciate the works of art as galleries are cluttered by visitors with back packs and prams taking selfies in front of the great works.It pays to plan your visit carefully and leave plenty of time. The maps and signage are not very good.Lunch in Galleries cafe was very good with good service.,Great to visit even if you are short on time
"May 15, 2019",It’s free to enter. Always has street performers in front to entertain. Great art on the inside. Even if you only have an hour it’s worth a visit ,Wonderful experience 
"May 14, 2019","We visited The National Gallery museum and it was a fantastic experience, but the building wasn’t so big as my expectations. ",Famous paintings throughout
"May 14, 2019",Art is subjective. I had a look around along with many many others and saw plenty of famous art. Is it worth the huge sums of money? Does it matter though?,Visit to National Gallery
"May 13, 2019",An excellent visit looking at a huge selection of paintings from so many artists in history and more....also an excellent choice of places within to eat and drink and not expensive.,Amazing
"May 13, 2019",It was an amazing visit to the National Gallery. All of the exhibits were interesting and it would be a good place to spend some time with your kids.,The Nation's treasure house.
"May 13, 2019",All the wonderful things that you would expect.I was shocked at how monocultural the visitors are.Why do young people not visit?It's their National Gallery too!,Seeing Priceless Originals
"May 13, 2019","This place is awe-inspiring to me.  Just to look at the original paintings, not copies or prints is worth the visit.  I could spend hours here.  One could do it justice with a visit of about two hours, I think.",Always something new
"May 12, 2019",Great shows great exhibitions. Always many interesting activities immediately outside on Trafalgar Sq.,Amazing Gallery
"May 19, 2019","I am no art expert but love to visit & have returned often to view the fantastic paintings in the collection. You really could spend hours here, but as it's free you can dip in & out. Go, enjoy & be amazed.",Nat. Gallery
"May 19, 2019","Brilliant, interesting and free. Good day out with children. Would go again. Good transport link's. Need a while day",Interesting to visit specially for children
"May 19, 2019",This is a nice place specially for children to learn about the country and religions aspects.Free entrance.. so many tourist... place are clean and there are some benches every corner if getting tired,Incredible works of art. Very central and easy to access.
"May 18, 2019","Incredible works of art, easy to navigate across the different galleries. From time to time they also have special exhibitions that educating. Very central and easy to access.",John Dee’s mirror.
"May 18, 2019","I went to the Anglo Saxon manuscript exhibition - Domesday Book, oldest living manuscript of Beowulf. Deep in the fugue of time and heritage, I exited that gallery and went to old familiar Gallery One, where Elizabeth 1’s necromancer John Dee’s mirror lives. And I mean lives, because in the depths of its obsidian reflections Dee would scry prophesies of what would come to pass. The British Museum with the Rosetta Stone and Lindow Man contains worlds upon worlds.",Time to gaze and breathe 
"May 17, 2019","A favourite haunt both for its architecture and exhibitions.  I often pick a room and simply sit and appreciate the many works on display, the range of people who visit and the privilege to go whenever I can.  ",Loved it
"May 17, 2019","Absolutely amazing. Such a wonderful collection and very nice staff who were very helpful. If you have an afternoon to spare, i would definitely recommend you check it out.",Family

"May 7, 2019","For most of the gallery there is no entrance fee. The portraits on display are exceptional. The collection of art is impressive. For art lovers your visit to London will not be complete without seeing this display. You can spend hours in this tranquil atmosphere admiring art. Just to name some of artists like Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Monet, Degas...",Amazing collection!
"May 7, 2019",Great museum with an amazing collection. Wear comfortable shoes and pick and choose what you most want to see. There is enough to see for several visits.,Prado reloaded :)))
"May 7, 2019","Having recently visited the Prado museum in Madrid, I was surprised of the outstanding quality and quantity of artists shown at the National Gallery (which offers free entrance and no need of waiting to enter).You name it, they have it: van Gogh, Holbein, Turner, van Eyck, Velazquez, Leonardo da Vinci....Highlight of our visit to the beautiful city of London :)))",High afternoon tea
"May 7, 2019","Just have to say that it was such a good vibe in the dinning hall of the National Gallery that we went there twice in the 4 days we where in London. The food and tea excellent as well, good portions and the little cakes were delicious. Just a very relaxing and all around good experience.",amazing fro all family
"May 7, 2019","make sure you go to the Natinal Gallery as its an amazing place to learn about the world, kids loved it when we went to visit it.",Fantastic for art lovers
"May 7, 2019",What a great collection of art works from many periods. I spent hours one day walking through history and enjoying the beautiful collection on display.,Sorolla Exhibition at the Sainsbury Wing is excellent
"May 7, 2019",The Sorolla exhibition is a MUST SEE. The incredible canvases filled with so much sunlight and movement. The brush strokes are mesmerising.The children on the beach. The colours of the water on their skin. He certainly was the Spanish Master of Light. ,Great variety of paintings
"May 7, 2019","We spent a couple of hours here, and will definitely return on a future trip, given the chance. There were many styles of painting to choose from, and we were glad to see some familiar ones. Having just come from Amsterdam, we were particularly drawn to the large galleries of Dutch artists. Barely scratched the surface, and could probably spend a couple days seeing this place at a leisurely pace.","Many, many, Lord/Lady pics."
"May 7, 2019","Art is always in the beholder's eye, so if you like a lot of allegorical paintings from the 1500-1700s this might be the place for you.  Very little Impressionism, hundreds of Lord and Lady pics, and only a smattering of the Still Life paintings that seem to be the province of British Art.  A good collection in a good space, but it all depends on what you like.",Enjoy the Sorolla Exhibition in the Sainsbury Wing
"May 1, 2019",A unique Museum...don't miss it! You will experience art at its finest and very best. Everything is perfectly organised and displayed.,It's a must
"April 28, 2019","I strongly recommend visiting it even if it is just for a while, as it is free you can just pop in an quickly go to the rooms you are interested in. I hate when there is a painting I like on loan though..",Sorolla a must see exhibition
"April 28, 2019","Vibrant, full of colour and sunlight, love shining through, a very underrated artist.  For me, the most importsnt exhibition in London.  I came out full of joy!",Great collection
"April 26, 2019","Wonderful collection with quite a few excellent gems. Absolutely loved the visit. Good place to hide from British rain, too.",Fantastic Sorolla Exhibit
"April 23, 2019","My wife really wanted to see this exhibition of Sorolla's works.  In fact it’s one of the main reasons we came to London to see his works.  This is one of the largest displays of his work outside of Spain.  I did not know much about him.  But I have to say I was really impressed by his art.  First of all his depiction of light in his paintings is incredible.  It evokes real emotions in his paintings.  Second was the scale of his work.  Many of his paintings are huge!  Not very practical for the average household, but terrific in a museum setting.  Third were the sheer number of paintings.  I didn't count, but there must be close to 100 displayed.Everyone viewing his works were very impressed.  It was obvious from their demeanor while viewing the art.  This was a wonderful exhibit and I am thrilled that I could share the experience with my wife.  She loved it!",Wonderful place to just wander
"April 23, 2019",So lovely to be back here after a while. Incredible art and lovely just to wander around and take my own time. Beautifully environmental and very enjoyable couple of hours. Loved the shop too!,Amazing
"April 23, 2019","I love art and I really enjoyed this gallery, especially van Gogh and other impresionists. However, this building is basically a maze and we had difficulties to walk through it. We went to some places several times and I'm sure we missed some rooms.",Must See
"April 22, 2019","We visited more on a whim because we were in Trafalgar Square and admission is free, but we were surprised at the wonderful assortment of art displayed here! There are works by Monet, van Gogh, Rembrandt, Cezanne, Michelangelo, Raphael, and many, many more. The attendants in each room are very helpful and will point you in the right direction if you get turned around (which is easy to do!). ",Last minute visit - would spend a day there (at least)
"April 22, 2019","In London for wife's bucket list things (as an Elizabethan history fan), we decided to put this in on our last day before train home.Big mistake. This place is awesome. Needs at least a day (unless you hate any art - that's a given right?).We didn't but my advice is to get a map/broucher of some sort - when we needed to leave (for our train) we realised we'd missed 20+% of the rooms.Even if this were £20/ticket I'd rate it up the same - astounding works from such a range of artists.I actually ran across a 40' room when I thought a painting in the corner was Renoir - and it was...But the Turners, Gainsboroughs and my wife fave, a huge Stubbs (that was a surprise that she was so enamoured).Go - do it.IT'S FREE.   unlike rip-offs elsewhere in the city...",Unique Fabulous Art Museum
"April 21, 2019","There's nothing like London's National Gallery. The collection is amazing. Leave it to the Brits to write the most interesting, concise tags. Went back twice!",
