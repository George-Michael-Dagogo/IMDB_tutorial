"February 26, 2020",Amazing spectacle,"This is well worth a visit if you are in London.  It is very tourist friendly with lots of information about and the tube station Tower Hill is just adjacent.  You can get some lovely photos of the outside if you walk along the river but if you pay to go in there is lots to see and the history is fascinating, especially Traitor's Gate.  The Beefeaters are very friendly and knowledgeable and everything is clearly laid out and helpful."
"January 4, 2020",Homogenized History Along The Thames ,"This is my favorite tourist attraction in London - but it has been 20 years since my last visit. It's so crowded now and you need to get there early to beat the mobs of people. The Yeoman Warder tours are worth doing and they provide you with lots of historical facts with a bit of humor. The line to see the Crown Jewels was ridiculous (my husband didn't want to see them and I already have) so we headed to the White Tower - where they now snake you thru the building like you are in Disney - a bit disappointing. But the artifacts, ravens, architecture and views of the Thames are worth checking out. "
"February 20, 2020",A great place but without great display,"I came here with very high expectations. The first thing we did was seeing the Crown Jewels. These were stunning and the highlight of the visit. Then to the exhibition on the Royal Menagerie. This was interesting to read about and it had some funny stories in there, such as the polar bear in the Thames, but it was difficult to visualise. We moved onto the little Fusiliers museum on site, which had some amazing collections of medals on display. Then onto the White Tower where the armour is housed. Once again this was fantastic but lacked atmosphere, a crucial part of a historic site. After this, we visited the Chapel Royal of St Peter ad Vincula. The graves of Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard are in here but not clearly visible. As good as seeing these graves was, the place, as with other locations, felt sterile. Beauchamp Tower showed clearly how, in my opinion, the atmosphere here was lost. There is a huge sign column in the middle of one of the important rooms, causing a build up of human traffic. I think it would be better to put signs on the walls to provide more space. Since we were on a time limit, the last room we visited was the Bloody Tower. Inside is a miniature cinema. This, as with Beauchamp Tower, took away the historic feel to the place. I also think having a dedicated shop for every major aspect of the Tower is not great either. My views may change if we spent more time here and did everything but overall, a fantastic historic site with a not so fantastic showing of the history."
"February 13, 2020",Part of History,We didn't have time to go through the tower to see the Jewel amongst other historical artefacts but looking at the building itself was quite impressive. The tower is quite large and located beside the iconic Tower Bridge so it is fairly easy to find. The masonry and stonework visible from the outside was enough to get me excited about going in. We were told you would need about 1.5-2 hours to go through the tower when booking tickets which was why we didn't end up going in since we would have only had an hour. It was nice that they weren't all about just selling tickets. We went to get tickets at the kiosk but think you were also able to do it online. It was disappointing we didn't get to go in but it is now on the list for the next visit.
"April 30, 2022",Crown jewels. ,My first visit with my wife to view the crown jewels and visit the Tower.Our Beefeater Andy gave a great presentation to our group about the Tower's history and its significance in the history of England. We enjoyed our day here and sampled the delights of the cafe and bought some very reasonably priced souvenirs. The staff here are very polite and courteous. They go the extra mile to make your visit a pleasant one. This is a premium attraction of London and should not be missed when visiting London.Thankyou all! 
"November 15, 2021",Fantastic,"Absolutely loved this visit. We booked tickets easily on line and admission as quick and smooth with friendly staff . Yeoman tour was so interesting and entertaining and pointed out all places of interest to look round after the tour.  Their knowledge is amazing , so many interesting and informative stories   Well organised and signposted . Very chilled as not too busy felt really comfortable . When I first booked I thought it seemed a bit expensive but was actually worth every penny . Good facilities available , toilets cafe etc ,"
"April 16, 2022",Badly organised with lengthy queues. Misleading website advice.,Spent almost £70 on tickets and followed their website’s advice of allowing around 3 hours for the visit. (Booked elsewhere afterwards based approximately on this timing. )Queued for around 1.5 hours in total whilst there - so basically paid £35 to stand in queues. Didn’t have enough time to visit most of the exhibits. Very disappointed at poor management. Pretty sure they knew what numbers were expected - why were better systems not in place to manage this?  And don’t get me started on the queue for the single ice cream truck.  Fully disappointed and annoyed at wasting my money.
"June 29, 2023","Good value,  amazing history and beautifully preserved","We got there half an hour after opening which wasn't busy but I recommend arriving 10 minutes before as you will beat the crowds and the many school groups.  We got a head set for the self tour but a private tour guide would have been more enriching. Go to see the crown jewels 1st as the queue gets quite big quickly. Lots of stairs so if mobility is a problem your access to many areas will be limited. Some areas are quite small and I feel they need better crowd control in those spots but overall it is a very big place so you mostly move freely. As expected,  the food and drinks inside are expensive (a latte made by an automatic coffee machine is £5)Good value 4 hours overall.  Absolutely amazing"
"June 26, 2020",So much to see and do here,"This was a great way to spend a portion of our day. Start with the Beefeater tour to get some information about the history of the area. They're funny and give a lot of details in a short amount of time. There's a little bit of everything to be found here, especially if you find the medieval era, monarchy, armor, jewels, architecture, swords, churches, palaces, ravens, and amazing views interesting. It is easy to spend hours wandering around to all the different buildings and displays. For those with disabilities, there are stairs in several buildings so getting around will present some challenges."
"June 6, 2021",Brilliant day out!,We came here with our two children and had a great time. It was fascinating to see the Towers close up and to see the Crown Jewels. My daughter particularly enjoyed this bit! The place is steeped in History and you find out so much as you're walking around. It was a glorious day too and the =ir weren't massive amounts of people there. My only disappointment was that we did not have enough time to really look around! This is not the Tower of London's fault though. The tube trains on the central and district line were closed so we had to walk about 50 minutes from our hotel. We then had to be at another attraction at 2! I would definitely recommend checking TFL for any train disruptions as this place really does need a good couple of hours to absorb it all in.
"February 20, 2020",Ceremony of the Keys,"For years on my bucket list has been to see the Ceremony of the Keys - the ceremonial closing of the Tower of London each night. Once they put this online I was able to book (it was 20 months in advance!) and finally tick off my wish.Doors opened at 9.30pm and we were given a very witty and interesting pre-tour escort by one of the Yeoman warders. The ceremony and its history was explained in the atmospheric Tower confines. Standing by traitors gate on a cold and damp February evening, picturing back in time certainly gave me the shivers!The ceremony itself was everything the British do best - I recommend if you can being at the far right of traitors gate, facing Wakefield Tower, for the best views. You are standing for about 40 minutes so the old and infirm, or very young, might find this a bit hard work. I really recommend it, if you get the chance, it felt like a privilege to witness a ceremony unchanged in 700+ years."
"February 11, 2020",Incredible historic site!,"The amount of history that is preserved and shared with the public is incredible. The Crown Jewels, the armoury, the animals, the cells, there is so much to see. You can take your time and wonder around, you can do an audio tour as well. There is a commemorative book that you can purchase for 5 pounds"
"October 28, 2020","Definitely NOT value for money, sorry.","My friend  and I Visited the Tower today, but it wasn’t really anything like we expected. It’s just a glorified musuem. I paid £25 a ticket, it was supposed to include The Crown Jewels, but the queue was ridiculously long, at least a 2 hour wait, we are in our 60’s and would never be able to queue that long. there should have been set times to queue for the jewels, There were no Yeomen guided tours, assumedly because if the pandemic, so all we saw were a few exhibits, a few information plaques and not much else.We treated ourselves to a scone with cream and jam and a cappuchino each and it came to a whopping £14! And they even charge a fiver each for the audio guides! I know they have lost millions due to lockdown, but these prices are just extortionate!A waste of money in my opinion,"
"September 26, 2020",Really disappointing ,While we were expecting changes due to covid - one way systems and extra queing time we were not prepared for most of the attractions to be shut. The buildings inside were crammed with no social distancing and no staff presence to enforce sense and order and the route forces you to walk your children through two gift shops which adds insult to injury when already paying full price for half an experience.If you want to visit I would wait until things are back to normal  
"January 2, 2020",A must see and do when in London!,I visited the Tower for the fifth time in my life in November as its my favourite historical place in the UK. Anyone visiting London for the first time should make this place their first location to visit as its where London really all began in 1066. It encompasses the history of our country in one location with so many memorable events and so many tales to be told by the excellent Yeoman of the guard who conduct the excellent tours. Lastly a visit to the Crown Jewels is a must as they are breathtaking and displayed in a memorable exhibit. A great value day out for all the family especially good for children to provide them with a better illustrated understanding of English history.
"January 7, 2020",A must see on a London visit,We were fortunate to visit on a cold weekday in January. No crowds do our ability to see and enjoy exhibits unencumbered by long lines made the visit delightful. I highly recommend purchasing the audio guide. The Cafe was reasonably priced with good options for a snack or lunch. 
"August 26, 2020",Nice day out ,"We had a really good day out to the tower today. You have to book in advance and we booked the 10.30 slot, if you can definitely book early as it got busier in the afternoon. We waited 10 minutes to see the Crown Jewels and 20mins to access the white tower. Wait times were considerably longer by the afternoon. The staff are doing a great job managing access to ensure social distancing is maintained. Almost everywhere is now open with the exceptions of the church and the Beauchamp tower. Be aware the HRP cafe is closed and only a Gourmet Sausage outlet is open so queues are huge and the food was atrocious. £6.50 for a bratwurst in a role, very poor quality and definitely not worth it. If we had know. I’d have brought food in with us. This was the only part of the day to let us down. "
"January 28, 2020","Thousand Year Old Architectural Treasure Stands Invincible, on the Banks of the Thames","My most recent encounter with the Tower was on a surprisingly sunny afternoon in January. I was at a distance, actually, looking across the Thames from the south bank. I was walking along the embankment, indulging in a slow gaze sweep across the river to the north bank when my eyes spotted the Tower. This imposing many towered castle fortress stands on its own grounds and therefore is not swallowed by nearby London skyscrapers, but gleams white and solid with the river before it. What a sight it is, in theatre slang, a 'real show stopper'. From my vantage point, I didn't see the crowds that cluster and walk through the castle daily. I've been one of them a few times, though, and can vouch for the inside being as impressive as the outside. Go early, before the doors open, and get in the queue before it becomes a long line that stretches out onto the streets of busy London. Inside you will see the crown jewels of many past rulers of England as well as the present Queen Elizabeth. Also on view are the armor of Henry VIII and other important medieval artifacts, including instruments of torture used to extract confessions during the centuries when the Tower was used as a prison. You will learn the history of the Tower .as you walk from room to room (It was built by William the Conquerer shortly after he invaded England in 1066 as a fortress and monument to his power and governmental reign.).Don't forget the ravens. There are six of them kept on the grounds at all times in deference to an old belief that it is good luck for the Kingdom's present and future; conversely, the ruination of the Tower is certain if the ravens are absent, and the Kingdom will fall, according to the legend. If you are lucky you will see one or more of the large, black feathered, yellow beaked creatures.You will definitely spot the red uniformed, white ruffed Yeomen Warders, who are another of the Tower's iconic figures, a combination castle Royal guard, keeper of the Ravens and the grounds, and guides for visitors maintenance. These women and men are hospitable, full of information about the Tower and have full, humorous personalities, no shrinking violets in that group! Plan a half day if you want to take it all in and go as early as you can. Or book an advanced ticket on the Tower's website and get a timed entry plus a tour. Well worth it."
"September 20, 2020",Perhaps expensive but so worth it!,"It’s such a long time since I visited the Tower of London and at £67.50 for the two adults and a child you couldn’t call it cheap. However, it was SO worth it and I’d recommend it as a day out that is great value for money. Shame the Coronavirus has reduced numbers so much and also makes the cafe and refectory not worth opening, but it’s a small point. "
"June 20, 2020",Arrive early ,"One of the MUST dos in London at least once, this place was a joy to explore. We took about 4 hours to feel like we explored enough of the grounds about 85%.  We really enjoyed the crown jewels. Truly breathtaking. Tip, arrive before opening to get in line. If you have an e ticket purchased through trip advisor or Get your Guide for example, you'll still need to line up in a separate line to obtain a physical ticket.They don't inform you until you're at the gate so beware. We waited in 3 separate lines before we finally got in to the right one with the right form of ticket. More signage could really avoid this. No photos of the crown jewels allowed but you can stay as long as you like. Again another pro tip, go straight to the crown jewels upon entering as a separate line will form quickly for that building alone."
"October 9, 2021",Simply amazing,"We knew the Tower of London was one of the top attractions here in London, however, the history and the crown jewels just blew us away.  The most important thing is to get the beefeater to give you a tour. Every hour on the hour there is one available just inside the main gate you will see a small crowd gathering around him. They are the most entertaining and funny lot . Facemasks were requested to be worn inside the buildings but not outside. The Crown  jewel area was the most crowded but everybody kept trying to adhere to the social distancing. The  jewels are very real - there are coronation crowns etc decorated with the most amazing precious stones among which are the largest diamond  and the second largest diamond in the world. Unfortunately no photography is allowed. Everywhere else you can take pictures. The Armory in the White tower is incredible  should not be skipped. When you’re done with the tower of London, take some time to walk along the wharf to admire the Tower Bridge that’s very nearby."
"January 8, 2020",Excellent Visit to Tower of London,"We visited the Tower of London in the late afternoon about 2 hours before closing.  We walked the grounds ourselves and enjoyed the scenery, information, and shops. We did not participate in the guided tour as we wanted to be certain to see the Crown Jewels before closing but stayed with it for a few stops and felt it would have been a good tour to continue if we had the time.  The exhibit that included the jewels was amazing as were all of the pieces of armor and armament on display.  Overall, well worth the price of admission even if though it was an abbreviated visit."
"February 16, 2020",Absolutely amazing ,If you love history The tower is a must.  We opted to wait for the guided Yeoman tour which was amazing. Our guide was very informative and hilarious. Unfortunately I don’t remember his name but he was brilliant. It is so impressive. The Crown Jewels exhibit is a highlight along with the white tower. You do need about 3 hours to see everything There is so much to see and it has a lovely cafe you can stop at for lunch or a snack. The food is good quality and reasonably priced. One of the highlights of our London trip 
"February 4, 2020",Call me old,"Call me old but my visit was less than perfect. At issue isn’t the contents of the castle (they’re extravagant and masterfully displayed). Remember, your looking at 1,000 years of history!My issue was the huge (literally)amount of uncontrollable elementary schoolers that ran rampant through the exhibition. Entire classes of students crammed everything. This was particularly true of the Crown Jewels & White Tower exhibitions. The noise and outright congestion and disruptions were too much. I’d would also suggest that the audio devises and user interface need simplified. I can’t believe how old I sound. But I’m not.......scary!"
"April 16, 2022",Pay a fortune to stand around in queues,Didn't actually get to see the crown jewels on this visit as queue was approx 2 hours long. Lengthy queues to enter most of the attractions on the day we visited including a lengthy queue to enter in the first place ( with a pre-booked ticket and time slot) At £79 for 2 adults and 1 child I feel this was an absolute waste of time and a total rip off. Do yourself a favour and visit one of the many free and wonderful museums such as the Natural history museum or Victoria and Albert instead of this money grab. Poor show.
"January 4, 2020",Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly. 4th Jan 2020 10:00am tour,Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly led the 10am slot tour for a relatively large group. He immediately grabbed the attention of all attendees with his enthusiasm and detailed explanation of the history of the place. You can tell he really enjoys his job and because of that we also enjoyed the entire tour. Well done Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly! I thoroughly enjoyed the tour. Huzzah!😎
"February 21, 2020",Very interesting ,"I hadn’t been to the tower for over 40 years, so was looking forward to it.You should definitely take advantage of the free Beefeater tour which lasts around 45 minutes (you need to have paid the general admission price to access this) - it’s very informative & you get a real insight into their history. Obviously, a real hi light is the Crown Jewels, but I loved going up the towers & also seeing the armour and weapons, and reading about the prisoners and executions! You can really spend a good few hours exploring & the cake in the cafe is very good! A great experience, worth the money in my opinion."
"January 26, 2020",Long,"If you care about history, you will enjoy it. Definitely buy audio guide for 5$, without it, you won't even know where you are going. You will spend minimum 2h there, prepare for it, cofee shop and toilets are available so thats not a problem."
"February 18, 2020",Grisly Tales of the Tower,"A brilliant tour led by Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly. He is a raconteur par excellence with a wealth of grisly historical knowledge about the tower. I did consider knocking a star off as I'm not sure his claim to be the best looking Yeoman Warder since their formation in 1485 can be historically verified. However, staying for photos with the children in the rain at the conclusion of the tour gets him a full 5 stars. "
"January 2, 2020",The Amazing Tower of London,"Just had a wonderful day at the Tower of London. I can’t speak highly enough of the Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters). They were amazing with my 4.5 year old daughter, taking both time and interest in answering her many questions and signing her Paddington book about the tower. She can’t stop talking about them and what a great day she had. Special mention to #398"
"October 24, 2020",Enjoy the space and sights!,"One of the strange upsides to visiting during these ‘Covid’ times is the lack of fellow visitors. If you’ve ever wanted to enjoy the Tower and all it’s history now is that time. We visited today, 11am on Saturday 24th October and enjoyed unrivalled access to many of the towers, grounds and of course the Crown Jewels. To visit these normally requires extended queuing, crowds and bustle with no time to enjoy. Today we could spend as long we wanted admiring royal treasures dating from centuries long past. The ability to stop and chat with unhurried and friendly Yeoman Warders was well worth the effort, they’ve always got tales to tell!Go while you can and enjoy the limited visitors and leisurely pace and progress around the Palace!"
"April 11, 2020",More than what we expect,It was one of the attractions included in the London pass. We have no regret to visit it as it was more than what we expect. The historical site  is rather big and we spent an hours plus to just walked around. All the buildings were really well maintained and in its original shape. We actually just a small group of people where there was tour guide  explaining the history of the building. Very interesting. Worth the time we spent there.
"July 9, 2023",Just Wow,"First of all, just wow. This was a fantastic day out in London and was well worth the price. We got there early with little to no queue to get into the place which was ideal. You would definitely need the whole day to properly go and look at all the magnificent displays and buildings on offer here. Unfortunately, we decided not to have a yeoman warder tour, which was completely a wrong choice as I have heard their tours are outstanding, so I would recommend waiting for the tour guide and going round with them before venturing off and finding your way around. Once you step into the buildings, it takes you straight back through the past, they are surprisingly well kept and very well preserved. The crown jewels were an absolute marvel to look at, though the line was long it moved very quickly. Overall, a spectacular day and will be coming again to have a proper tour."
"December 30, 2022",To many visitors admitted,"Even though we pre-booked tickets, we had to queue for 30 minutes to get entry. To see the Crown Jewels would have required another 60 minutes queuing with no timed access. Overall they had admitted far too many people and all of the exhibits were overrun and difficult to see."
"August 28, 2021",Worth a visit,"Have been wanting to go for a number of years and was very happy that we went. Was made to feel very welcome and all the beefeaters were friendly and happy to chat. I felt that the to the staff this was not just a job but a passion and they wanted to be there, this was evident to how they served the guests with humour and a smile. The only things that could made quicker was the queue to the Crown Jewels and the restaurant only took cards cash not allowed, not made clear until you are at the till with trays full of food.I would like to thank all the staff for making everyone welcome please keep it up you are appreciated by us guests."
"October 23, 2022",The best thing to do in London,"Our Yeoman Tour guide was one of the best guys I’ve had anywhere ever. The tours, which are included in admission, start every 30 to 45 minutes. My group was lucky enough to get Shandy (or maybe it was Shady).   The tours last about 45 minutes and I ended up spending about six hours walking around the grounds. For me, it’s the best thing to do in London."
"August 15, 2021",Well worth a visit,"We only had a few hours, would highly recommend to anyone. If you visit? Make sure you go on a beefeater tour - ours was Barry Stringer, he was extremely knowledgeable, passionate about what he does and added humour along the tour. Also a mention to Louisa, who also had passion for what she does and the knowledge she has is brilliant. The only downside to this visit? Was the queues for a coffee, it needs better organisation, I felt sorry for the guy serving us under extreme pressure and people stood there tutting because they had to wait. Other than that? Great day out for all"
"February 24, 2021",A brilliant place but too much rain ,"The tower is possibly my most favourite place to visit and it still is but we didn’t have a great visit last time. This was not due to anyones fault but the weather was appalling. It was heavy, continuous torrential rain and there was no indoor seating available and the outdoor cafe was just doing takeaway drinks. Our shoes had to be thrown away after our visit. It was such a shame as we had booked our tickets so far in advance online. We will just have to go again when all of the restrictions are over "
"March 1, 2020",Interesting,"It’s always very busy whenever you go, usually heaving in fact. Nearly all the loos closed for maintenance which isn’t great planning. Cafe is hideous. My youngest (5) got shouted at by a guard for leaning over a fence. No signs saying do not touch or do not lean over, suspect it was for the theatre but he was very upset. He wears it like a badge of honour now though."
"January 9, 2020",Sight seeing ,Great place of history. Expect to climb a lot of stairs if you wish to see everything. Go early and see the jewels with very little wait. Any time if the year go early and there will be less people. Listen to a beefeater tour they have so much personality and are fun and knowledgeable. A must see if you have never been to London. 
"January 26, 2020",Long,"If you care about history, you will enjoy it. Definitely buy audio guide for 5$, without it, you won't even know where you are going. You will spend minimum 2h there, prepare for it, cofee shop and toilets are available so thats not a problem."

She can’t stop talking about them and what a great day she had. Special mention to #398"
"January 4, 2020","Always interesting to visit, go early!","This was my third time to the Tower, always full of history and interesting. We did a tour with the beefeaters which I’d highly recommend, it’s a free tour and definitely worth it!I can’t stress enough that you need to go to this attraction right when it opens and head straight to the Crown Jewels. The lines become crazy about and hour or two after opening. We went on a Thursday morning and were able to walk right to the Jewels ( at 9:30 am), by 11am when we left the site the line was gigantic. Go early! "
"March 3, 2020",Always Worth It!,"This was probably my 10th visit to the Tower, but it’s always the first stop when I bring friends to London.  The Tower just never disappoints — 1000 years of history in one spot!  This time we met the Raven Master, which was a special treat.  The Crown Jewels are always brilliant, and I love the addition of animal sculptures that are in tribute to the old Menagerie.  The history of the Tower is so fascinating — I never run out of info to share with my friends.  Once again, an impressive first day in London!"
"October 30, 2021",Full Day of History ,"This was a fantastic day out on its own!  Tip: Start immediately at the Crown Jewels as the queues get massive later.The place is huge and there is so much to see, read and take in.  My husband and I arrived with our 6yr old in the October half term and used our Go City passes for entry which saved us a significant amount of money.The famous sights including the Ravens, the Bloody Tower and Crown Jewels were fantastic and we were amazed that people actually lived on site!  Highly recommended trip!"
"July 10, 2022",Waste of money!,"Tower of London and Superbloom 👎🏼 Don’t waste money paying for superbloom you can look at it from outside Tower,unless you absolutely love 4 wild flowers repeatedly planted.The Tower of London offers not much for the money. Lots and lots of stairs and exhibits were very poor. The Crown Jewels 💎 were rushed on an actual conveyor belt so you can’t look at them in detail. The queue for this was very long and exhibits as you walk through the building were boring.Wouldn’t waste your money!Boring for children."
"January 20, 2023",Family Visit to enjoy,"The Tower of London is truly unique, it’s such an amazing place to visit.  Built by William the Conquerer. So much history.  Loads of items to view. The Crown Jewels are a must.   My complaint is about the beefeater tour. I couldn’t hear what the guide was saying, he was making jokes during the tour which I found irritating because I was interested in hearing the history of the Tower. Because of the  cold outside we were given the talk inside the chapel where Ann Boleyn is buried,  When our guide finished his talk, he marched us out of the chapel immediately, we were not allowed even Five minutes to view where the wives were buried, or to view the plaques on the walls. I did ask if I could have a minute to absorb the whole atmosphere of the place and to enjoy being in such a historic place, but he demanded me to leave at once stating that another tour was ready to come into the chapel!! This was not true, because when we were outside I noticed the following tour was not even near the chapel. We could have been left to enjoy our historic location even for five minutes. I feel I paid a lot of money and Ann Boleyn, Catherine Howard and Lady Jane Grey are so famous wives of Henry 8th , it’s wonderful to think one is actually standing beside their graves . The graves are cordoned off but there is a nice piece written about all three if one was allowed to even read that!  It unfortunately spoiled my visit.  This Tower belongs to the people who pay good money to come and enjoy it. Therefore we should be allowed enjoy it."
"January 1, 2020",Last Tour of 2019,"We arrived at 2:15pm and the line for the Crown Jewels was over 2 hours long, so we decided to skip it due to the 4:30 pm closing time.  There was Yeoman Warder (Beefeater) tour starting, so we decided to go with that and were privileged enough to be on the last tour of 2019 with Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly. The tour was amazing and YW Kelly was full of information, history, comedy, and of course, good looks. After the tour, we went into the White Tower at YW Kelly’s suggestion and it was amazing and definitely not to be missed!  When we finished at 4:25pm, there was no line at all for the Crown Jewels, so we were able to squeak in and see them in 5 minutes.  5-10 minutes is all that is really needed for this, but definitely no photos allowed in here. All in all, I highly recommend the Yeoman Warder tour and the White Tower. Get there early and allow more time as there was a lot more to see than we could squeeze into our 2 hours there. #beefy409"
"February 17, 2022",Great day at the Tower,"We arrived at the Tower just as Yeoman Scott Kelly was about to start the guided tour which I would thoroughly recommend. I’ve done the tour a few times over the years and it’s always informative, great for adults and children alike but most of all very funny. These Yeomen have been there and done it and they are full of personality and can tell a story. All that aside Scott said he got the job because he looks like Paul Hollywood Thanks for a great tour Scott 🧁 🍰 🎂"
"February 24, 2022",Significant history well maintained,"Pre-booked online, arrived at customer service desk to plan our visit (as signed outside) but they explained they were significantly reduced due to the pandemic. The entry queue was short and moving so no problem. Most areas were accessible, would have helped to have staff members inside some rooms for Q and A, the Crown Jewels were impressive and well labelled. We skipped the White Tower due to a lot of steps!"
"July 10, 2022",Wonderful,"Went to superbloom yesterday. It was fabulous! The flowers were stunning. It was really worth the money. Only drawback, which they do say on the ticket, is if it gets hot the slide will close. Staff let grandchildren on as for one go they were shutting it and they loved it.  But I would say it was a huge design flaw.. metal slide. After all the effort put into the beautiful walk and displays this was a basic mistake they should have solved  as they expected it to happen. Go early in morning in late in day to avoid disappointment of that being closed. But flower display was really beautiful"
"January 19, 2020",A trip through history,"What a great experience. We pre-booked the tickets on the Tower of London's website and arrived just before they opened. It was so interesting and immersive, the crown's jewels were gorgeous and the exhibition was quite impressive. We learned a lot of different facts and really enjoyed ourselves."
"April 7, 2023","Simply put, a must-do","Easily one of London's most popular attractions, a visit to the Tower of London (it effectively describes the entire stone fortress) can be at best a very entertaining half-day out but it can also be a trying experience depending on the weather and/or the crowd.  We visited in December, when the weather was brisk (the rain stayed away, thankfully) and crowds were minimal and queues were fairly short and moved quickly.  We also got in when the gates opened, so managed to move around easily.  We signed up for the yeoman warder's guided tour as it was the only way to visit the CHapel Royal of St Peter ad Vincula - each tour is slightly different but all are highly informative and educational, albeit presented in an  entertaining manner (extra credits if you're selected to be 'insulted' for your nationality), and ours was no exception.  And while the Crown Jewels (no photography allowed) are high on most visitors' list of things to see, there were lots of other historical parts of the grounds worth visiting.  We also took some time to walk the fort's ramparts to enjoy views of the River Thames.  There was only one indoor cafe, and that was rather crowded around lunch time, but there was an outdoor one for snacks.  It's hard to estimate the amount of time needed to see the ToL - we were there for just over four hours which was adequate to see all the attractions."
"April 15, 2022",The Treasured Tower,"The Tower of London is one of my favourite London experiences; I never get tired of it. We brought our two daughters here in March during a school break, as previously, I'd only been twice - as a boy with family, then with my wife before kids. And it was truly a terrific experience for my 11 and 7 year old daughters.  They enjoyed the White Tower with all the cavalry and weaponry exhibits, and they enjoyed the coin-making exhibits which had a pleasant and unexpected surprise of the staff giving us a bit of a private history lesson!! Yes, there are some dark tales surrounding this place, that's what gives it its mystique.  Great views on the battlements, and in the centre of the courtyard with Tower Bridge in the backdrop, so plenty of photo ops to be had. And it goes without saying that the Crown Jewels are so breathtakingly beautiful, we even went on the conveyer belts twice since we went at a low tourist time (on a Weds. no less)."
"September 3, 2021","Much more than a ""Tower""","After touring the Tower of London, I would call it the 'Walled Town of London"".  Certainly there are towers within it, but it's so much more than that, with many buildings, fascinating exhibits, amazing architecture and offering great vistas of the city outside of it's walls.  This is definitely a ""don't miss"" on your trip to London, but you'll need at least half a day to see it.  You can take photos inside and out, so be sure to bring a good camera.  "
"October 2, 2020",Trip with the kids,"Brilliant, went for 11am on a Sunday, quiet to begin with, would recommend seeing the Crown Jewels first, there was no queue when we arrived but had to wait 10/15 mins to enter later on.  Could still see the Jewels without anyone in the way which was great.  There was a lot we didn't get to see so will go back.  Kids really enjoyed it, especially the scavenging Raven!"
"April 20, 2022",The Most enthusiastic tour I have ever had,"What a fantastic day! Was met at the start by Yeoman Scott Kelly #beefy409 and was immediately immersed in the experience with his great enthusiastic tour, engaging the group and getting the kids involved. My daughter was so attentive listening to him and loved every second of it. This place is steeped in history and is worth a visit, can easily spend the day there, take time talk to the Beefeaters, the staff, the entire team. Was welcomed and safe. Can not fault and already planning a return trip. Highlight was the Crown Jewels and the girls meeting #Beefy409 who over the Covid lockdowns provided online contact for them to learn from whilst at home. A great day out, worth the travel! Two tired girls at home in bed now."
"July 14, 2022",Fascinating place - well worth a visit,"Very much worth booking a ticket online and visiting this great place.  I would also recommend paying for the audio tour, makes for a much more emersive experience.Its interesting learning about the history of this castle but the highlight is definitely the UK crown jewels.  Long queue which moves pretty quickly but its worth it to see such a magnificent collection.Highly recommend visiting here."
"February 11, 2020",The Yeoman Warder tour is a MUST do! Makes the place come alive,"Yeoman Warder Lawrence was an AMAZING tour guide. One of the best tours Ive ever been on, so full of information, story telling finesse and witty humour! Without a tour, a lot of the history would be lost on you so i strongly recommend it. The armoury and crown jewels didn't take that long. Would have loved more information about the chapel, not that much signage. Exhibits were modern and kid friendly."
"February 6, 2022",Day sight-seeing ,"This is brilliant, if you go by train, get the two for one offer, as it is expensiveDo the walk tour with the Beefeaters as it is brilliant. Then wander in and out and make a day of it to get full value for money. The cafe was nice enough, noisy with hard chairs and hard floorsThe food was quite tasty, all be it a bit extensive, but if you are there for the day it's got to be done"
"September 26, 2021",A MUST SEE!,"I have lived in and been a regular visitor to London but despite walking past the Tower of London hundreds of times I’d never been until today - I wish I’d come sooner! I spent 2.5 hours there and really enjoyed seeing almost 1,000 years of history up close. I did the self guided audio tour as well as the Yeoman tour which was superb - Scott Kelly was a fantastic guide and really brought the place to life. The Crown Jewels are spectacular. Even more so than I thought they would be up close."
"July 29, 2022",Look out for Beefeater Dave!,Haven’t visited for 25 years so was lovely to go back. Incredibly impressive and interesting. We precooked tickets and entry time and I would recommend going early in the day before the queues for exhibits like the Crown Jewels. We met Yeoman Warder Dave who was fantastic in providing information and historical insight mixed with some humour! 
"January 24, 2020",Amazing in every way!,"There are so many things I could say about The Tower of London! My husband, two teen daughters, and myslef were here for an entire day and it was still not enough time.  There is so much to see from the crown jewels to King Henry VIII's suit of armour, the zoo and the chapel where several notable people are buried.  I love it and will be going back!  Plan at the very least to spend 3-4 hours here!  "
"June 28, 2022",So Much History in the Heart of London,"The best part of our visit was the Yeoman Warder Tours which are free to all ticket holders. It was a 45 minute, well-spoken historical tour of the tower. I recommend seeing the crown jewels first upon arrival, then queuing for these tours next to avoid the crowds somewhat.  After the free tour, we knew enough to wander on our own throughout the grounds for a very enjoyable day."
"August 8, 2021",My Family Trip to Tower of London,"We had a lovely day at the Tower this summer holidays. We were took on a tour by the most amazing Yeoman Warder/ Beefeater, who provided a hilarious, informative and entertaining tour of the Tower. The place is packed with history and so many iconic sights. A family can easily spend the whole day there. Highly recommend for family outings. "
"July 7, 2021",A Must See in London,"Most people have heard about the infamous Tower of London and its royal prisoners, beheadings etc. and even if you have no interest in history itself you must visit this site as the genuine item. It is larger than you imagine and there are multiple towers to explore and steep spiral staircases so not suitable for everyone. All the crown jewels are on display and much more. During Covid this is definitely the time to visit as exceptionally quiet and you can spend as much time as you choose viewing all the exhibits. With no queuing and leisurely exploring we needed 3 hours to see everything. Note the early closing though. Our tickets purchased directly on line were a bargain at £24 each."
"April 10, 2022",Yeomen Warders tour...highlight that should not be missed.,"Visit to the Tower Of London - highly recommended.  We had a fabulous tour from Beefy409 who was entertaining, informative and engaging. Involved the crowd and my daughter (and her toy bunny Strawberry) was able to get involved and loved every minute of it! Do not miss the tour. Good few hours spent there and another highlight was viewing the Crown Jewels."
"January 26, 2020",A long time coming,"After many visits to London, we finally made the time to go to the Tower. With so much history to absorb, do yourself a favour & get the audio guide. Learning the long history of the Tower really makes you wonder how a building can stand for so long. Also having access to The Crown Jewels & hearing that the real ones are kept at the Tower is unbelievable. This was definitely worth the wait. "
"January 4, 2020","Crowded like mad, but beautiful","It's a gorgeous place, but the crowds make it very unpleasant. If you visit with a wheelchair, get ready for a bumpy ride over cobblestones. The Beefeaters go out of their way to help and accommodate wheelchairs, but the place really doesn't lend itself to them. The Crown Jewels are cool, but the real joy for me was the White Tower museum displays and the Ravens, which have no fear of humans whatsoever."
"September 15, 2022",A London must see!,"I originally thought the Tower of London was just a tower...actually one of the towers holding up the tower bridge.  I could not have been farther from the truth.  It is a fortress and  former royal residence that holds within it a concentrated dose of everything British.  It has history, tradition, jewels and very helpful Yeoman Warders to tell its story.  Our visit was just two days before the death of Queen Elizabeth II, so much of what we saw was poignant and moving."
"March 7, 2020",Behind the walls of history ,"So much history behind the walls of the London Tower. There are so many different areas that you can go in visit. The Crown Jewels were amazing to see in person. There are tickets booths all over the place for this place, if you’re a student remember your student card you get a discount!"
"June 8, 2023",Recommend getting in early,"We visited the Tower of London on a cold (cold by Australian definition) Monday morning during a school term. We arrived at 9.15am to line up for a 10am opening. Lucky we did because the line was right across the square by 9.30am. Tickets were scanned and maps handed out while we were waiting for the gates to open which made entry quite quick. We opted for an audio self guided tour which did add value and was worth it. We headed straight to the Crown Jewels upon entry. I don’t think my expectations were in check because I expected more from the Jewels. There wasn’t as much on display as I expected, which was more tiaras and jewellery. It took us a while to get through the Crown Jewels as there was lots of people and it was dark. By the time we got out the line to get in filled the stanchions. The actual Tower itself was interesting, particularly where prisoners were kept; the armoury was also quite interesting and there was much more on display than just armour; the towers with the Beefeater display which included insights into their training and background was worth a visit; and the talks around the place with the Beefeaters also looked quite engaging. Unfortunately we only had two hours here as we had another tour to get to. Would recommend at least 3-4 hours on a warm day."
"August 7, 2022",Enjoyed Superbloom,Enjoyed the superbloom wild flowers walk around the Tower.  We didn't pay to go in the tower but enjoyed listening to the guide giving tours of the tower as we entered the flower area and would think about doing that in future.  You can see the flowers for free from the road above the tower entrance but it was nice to walk in amongst the flowers.
"August 4, 2021",Tower of London Tri,"So much history to be part of. My granddaughter really enjoyed herself and so did I. I had watched the series on TV and just  had to visit. The Yeoman who gave us our tour experience was so funny and descriptive of the torture and murders that have been commited over time. The restaurant food was very satisfying and very clean, good service provided. The Ravens were very talkative as they flew around the Tower. A top Ten place to visit."
"January 11, 2020",A must see location,Visited on a midweek day in January and really enjoyed the experience. Really felt part of the atmosphere that has accumulated over the centuries. Appreciated that it wasn’t too crowded and managed to see everything. Arrived at 12:30 due to our off peak train times and wanting to use the 2 for 1 voucher and were still exploring when the wardens started locking up at 4:30. Cannot recommend it enough.
"January 25, 2020",Yeoman Warder Tour and Crown Jewels,"We spent about half a day at the Tower of London and could have easily spent more time if we hadn’t saved it for the second half of the day.  The Yeoman Warder tour was amazing: very informative and our YW had an excellent sense of humor (“ask me anything except about the Ravenmaster,” he told us, before taking a jab of conjured jealousy at his more famous colleague - he later doubled back on that and told us that there were such things as stupid questions, recalling a story of such a question a few years before).  The line for the Crown Jewels was surprisingly short and we were able to go straight in to see these valuable and beautiful symbols of British royalty.  We also very much enjoyed walking the walls and going inside towers that once held famous prisoners - you can even see messages those prisoners carved into the walls.  Absolutely amazing!"
"May 25, 2022",London Icon,A wonderful iconic site to visit in London.  They have regular guided tours by the Beefeaters relaying all the history of the Tower & its former occupants.  A glance of the crown jewels is a bonus.  We were there when they fired the cannons too.
"January 27, 2022",Go now whilst its quiet!,"We visited here whilst it was quiet (I'd walked past a few days previously and asked one of their guides how busy they were and they told me they were very quiet so we decided to take a day off and visit a few days later). The Yeoman Warder's tour was excellent (well done Beefy!) just the right mix of humour and fun alongside the historical facts. We also learned something new about the Crown Jewells from one of the guides which were brilliant. We ended up getting the season pass as we want to go back in the summer and we cant wait to visit Hampton Court, Kew, and Banquetting House. "
"January 5, 2020",Disappointed with the level of interpretation,"I hate to say it but I was disappointed. The building is of course awe inspiring but the interpretation within is dull. We went straight in with our Hisoric Royal Palaces and so did not see whether there was an audio tour available but once inside there was so much reading that you missed the feel of the place. Even in the prison area it was just reading, which with so many people was not easy to do as could not get near to the signs. The best bit of interpretation about prisoners was just seeing Walter Raleigh’s area and what it would have been furnished like.The White Tower was the biggest disappointment as, amazing though it is on the outside, inside is just the Armoury. I was hoping for at least a bit of a view of how the Kings and Queens would have lived.The best bit of our day was listening to Yeoman Warden 409 Scott ? On the Yeoman Warden Tour as without his stories and information we would have not have got a feel for the history of the place."
"March 2, 2020",Interesting but not worth the expense,"I'd been to the Tower years ago traveling alone. I thought that bringing my kids would be a great way to introduce them to the city. For the cost of the tickets, it was a silly choice. The grounds are beautiful but for as much as there is to the place, there isn't much to see. Spend your money elsewhere or visit a free museum."
"January 4, 2020",Cracking day out,"It's a full days outing this one. Start with the included tour by the warders, who are all larger than life wannabe actors! Lots of history lots to see. Plenty of walking and steps. Wear sensible footwear. Prices inside very reasonable. Expect queues to see the baubles which are better in real life than any photo. Child friendly with a big cafe. Limited toilets so plan ahead when going round. Can get very busy so go early. "
"November 6, 2022",Priceless experience,"The Tower of London is a great place to spend a few hours learning about the history of London and the Royal family. Starting with a fantastic tour from Beefeater 409, who clearly has a passion for The Tower of London and the history it holds, to looking around the buildings that hold so much history. It was particularly special to see the Crown jewls so close. The staff clearly do an amazing job at taking care of the grounds and give the public a priceless experience! Recommend to all :)"
"January 29, 2020",Beefeaters and Royal Guards,"The whole experience of the Tower of London is worth the time taken. From the colorful & handsome uniforms of the Beefeaters along with their stories of Historical events taking place there to passing the remains of the ancient Roman wall that the site was built on. I was startled by the ""frozen"" Royal Guards outside of the Crown Jewels display when the clock chimed and there was a changing of the Guards. They hadn't moved a wink beforehand and one literally could barely see them breath. So much discipline! And the exquisite beauty and majesty of the Crown Jewels are impressive. Again, well worth the time spent."
"July 22, 2022",A wonderful experience.,"We visited in July so that we could also visit Superbloom. It was quite surreal to sit in the moat of the Tower surrounded by flowers. Loved seeing the history of the Tower. There was a queue to see the Crown Jewels, but didn't have to wait long at all. It was very well organised and we loved the escalators to keep everyone moving by the Crown Jewels. One small observation - even though it clearly staed no photographs, there were people taking photos - which was disrespectful. What an incredible experience. It's well worth a visit!."
"January 1, 2023","Good visit, but go early to avoid crowds during high travel seasons","We got tickets using Headout and made sure to select the first time slot available that day. It was a very very busy day and this was the best thing I could have done. Highly recommend trying to catch a tour with one of the Yeoman Warders if lossible, even if it's shortened due to the rain as ours was it is still a lovely experience"
"July 16, 2022",It’s a big tourist attraction for good reason,"This was a big tourist attraction- and was well worth it.  We booked tickets for 10 am, which was ideal.  We missed the morning rush on the Tube.  It got much busier after we arrived.  We started to wander from building to building but realized that the crowd was growing so we got into a relatively short line to see the Crown Jewels.  By the time we finished and came back outside, the line was growing, and after we went to one other building, the line to the jewels was massive.  So, tip would be to arrive at 10 and go to see the jewels first.  The beefeaters were all over the place and were very interesting and funny tour guides.  The super bloom for the jubilee is a big wildflower planting in the moat.  You can see it just fine without the extra ticket (which lets you walk in the paths near the flowers). We grabbed lunch from one of the food trucks (from Uzbekistan - really tasty) and ate at a picnic table overlooking the Thames.  After the Tower, we took the tube (then changed to DLR) to Island Gardens and then walked thru the tunnel under the Thames to Greenwich.  Very cool experience."
"March 8, 2020",Exploring history,"Having watched the tv show, I wanted to see the Tower for myself. We had a wonderful time seeing and experiencing centuries of history for ourselves. We had a tour with Tower Warden Clive (he said to say his name was Phil if we didn’t enjoy it 😂) and despite him struggling with a cough, not Corvid-19 as he was keen to assure us; was loud, entertaining and knowledgable. Get well soon sir, and thank you for this morning. Well worth a visit. "
"August 26, 2020",Just brilliant ,"We spent a hugely enjoyable day in the Tower of London today. The fact that the tickets are for timed entry means that the queues are not too long and it is not too crowded. The signage is great, many parts are open and empty, and the Crown Jewels simply wonderful. This is an attraction in London that is worth every penny. The Beefeaters are the icing on the cake - really friendly and knowledgable. If you want a Covid safe, fun, clean, efficiently  run and totally fascinating historical attraction in London then this is the one!"
"August 4, 2022",Over crowded and long queues even with timed tickets,Disappointed that even with timed tickets the attraction was far too crowded to be enjoyed. Queues for crown jewels and bloody tower were well over an hour long each. Fewer tickets should have been available to maintain the safety and enjoyment of visitors. It was far better when managed under English Heritage. Making money rather than providing a good customer experience seems to be the priority
"June 2, 2021",So much history. So worth the visit,"OK I am a Brit who has taken years to visit the tower. Absolutely worth it. Surprisingly large site is packed with a thousand years of British and English history. The crown jewels are exactly as you would expect and the way the team blend the working nature of the Tow er, changing of the guard with the tourist curiosity is perfect. Walk the ramparts, see the Ravens, Beefeaters and historic graffiti.  Worth the trip. "
"October 27, 2023","Great day out, please visit ","Can't recommend a trip to the Tower of London too highly. It's a really great day out. At first the ticket price of £32 each appears very expensive, but trust me, it's real value for money. You get to see so much real history, touch the walls that have stood there for years, and see the well laid out exhibits from over the centuries. We went early and we beat the crowds, we walked straight in to see the crown jewels, no queue at all. They are amazing! The bloody tower, the white tower, Beefeaters, Ann Boleyn, Sir Walter Raleigh, changing of the guards, traitors gate, so much to see. The exhibits are easy to view and understand. Really impressed. We saw what we wanted to see and stayed for just over 3 hours, but could have done another hour easily. We finished our trip with a walk around the ramparts, where we had great views of London. Highly recommended 👍"
"July 26, 2023",For the serious history buffs only.,"We went later on in the afternoon, around 3pm and we struggled to find things to keep us amused for 2 hours. We saw the queue for the Crown Jewels and winced. There were so many people. We also found we had to queue to get into most of the different exhibits too. None of which were worth it. We queued for about half an hour to get into Wakefield Tower. I don't know why, there was one torture device and then out the other end. It was good to see the Ravens and they were going about the grounds. We found that the exhibitions just did not have as much information as expected and I didn't learn anything different that I didn't already know. As we had gone near the end of the day, we were lucky and only had a 5 minute wait to get in to see the Crown Jewels. I certainly wouldn't have waited all day in the queue we saw when we first got there. Also found there was not any of the modern day jewels either. Interesting enough but not worth the £34 paid for the entrance fee."
"October 30, 2020",A Fortress A Palace & A Prison,This building has seen it all. if you are in London spend half a day on this side take a 21 pound tkt wait for a free guide see the Kohinoor taken from India. see the armoury and as you exit walk towards tower bridge see tower bridge and cross the other side
"February 21, 2020",Family break, This was really good but weather let it down everyone was doing the inside things which  I can't blame them . But things weren't on due to weather I'm sure in the winter months they could be arranged to do more things in doors . Looking around did keep the kids amused. The dragon was amazing what it was made out of 
"April 23, 2022",A beautiful piece of history,"I was looking forward to visiting a castle in Ireland, and Killkenny was near where I was staying. I took the unguided tour solo and really did enjoy the architecture and design. I enjoyed reading about the history and watching the film first is a must to understand more of the history. I am so glad that it is being preserved! The great hall was absolutely amazing! Quite by accident I found a small area where a collection of new tapestry's we're being displayed. They are near the Tea Room and are a must see! They are gorgeous!I had hoped to see more rooms that were furnished to gain a better understanding of what they would have looked like, but the black and white photos posted throughout helped a bit. I unfortunately had a mother with three loud children that were very distracting during my walk through."
"April 15, 2023",Family day at the Tower of London,"Short queue to get in, Yeoman tour with the lovely Mark was a great way to kick off the day with his great humor and all the gory facts. Was the highlight of the visit for us.Some queues here and there esp for crown jewels and food but nothing more than 30mins and were kept moving.I would have preferred a bit more interactive torture area to bring that part to life, but the kids loved the ravens, the armour and playing on the battlements. Views of the bridge were stunning and overall we had a great day and filled over 5 hours there, so well worth the ticket price.Prepare for a 2nd mortgage for ice cream, (£10.50 for 3 small single scoops), but you can take your own food and drink in, so cheaper options ."
"October 20, 2021","A great day out for the family, just a shame it is so expensive that many won't get a chance to visit","A brilliant day out the beefeater tour is well worth it and as well as a great knowledge of history they have a great attitude to children asking relentless questions. We all had a brilliant time the only down side would be the price of admission which now means a typical family may not be able to visit, which I feel is a shame. But other than that a excellent day out you will not regret going. "
"October 28, 2020",Tower of London during Covid,"Really enjoyed the Tower of London and learning about the history, people and executions. We got in as part of a package deal so it worked out really well price wise. They make you wear a mask but that's to be expected with Covid-19 happening. Would recommend the Tower of London to anyone looking to learn more about British history or who wants to visit one of the best attractions in London."
"May 6, 2022",Fantastic day at the Tower of London,We rebooked this visit and arrived for its opening there was a massive queue for pre-booked but it went down very quickly. We spent all day in there around six hours. We did the first tour at 10:30 with the beefeaters these toes are every half an hour. Then went on to the Crown Jewels as that was popular. The tour was very informative and funny. The Crown Jewels on amazing. And we went round everywhere within the Tower of London. Lots of walking and stairs. We ate in the CAFE there which was busy and the food was nice with plenty of choice. We carried on walking round all of the towers. There are interactive things. And the staff are friendly and very knowledgeable. If you’ve never been I would recommend you spend a day there.
"August 17, 2023",You gotta love lines,"Word of advice if you don't want to wait around all day GO FIRST THING IN THE MORNING!!!Our tickets were for early afternoon and by then the place is packed with people everywhere. The line for the crown jewels exceeded the designated area and went down the hill with an estimated wait time of 45 mins to an hour, according to the sign. It's a cool building but my favorite place was the moat. It had about a dozen people wandering around and was full of wild flowers."
"August 17, 2023","Excellent visit, well worth it","Second time here and worth every penny. You could literally spend all day here listening to the beefeater tours, walking through the many exhibitions, see the crown jewels and much much more.Highly recommend anyone who is interested in history."
"August 17, 2023",Interesting,Very interesting. Get there early and go straight to the Crown Jewels before the lines start to form. It is worth getting the audio tour.
"August 17, 2023",Early start at the Tower!,"Begin your Tower of London experience with an early start time! Especially during the summer months as the crowds can be extreme. We started at 0930. Check-in at the site was a breeze. Tip: once through the security check, go straight to the Crown Jewels as the queue can be very very long if you decide to wait. No pictures once inside! The Beefeater tour thereafter is excellent fun and a learning experience for all! Our two teenage boys enjoyed every bit of the Tower! Make sure to walk the moat! Once your group finishes with all that The Tower of London has to offer (lunch there is great) make sure to head over to the Tower Bridge and walk across and take in the city and river views!"
"August 16, 2023",Tour of Tower of London,Absolutely loved  Tower of London. We booked a tour and view of Crown Jewels however we took ourselves around. We couldn’t hear a word the guide was saying due to the size of the group. Definitely needs a microphone👍
"August 16, 2023",worth a visit,we where on a coach holiday which included time at the Tower of London we visited the crown jewels we where advised to go here 1st as  popular for tourists saw where Anne Boleyn was executed also visited the chapel we had a set time on our tickets which we had to go in at we also saw the  moat where the  wild flowers where grown you could see yeoman warders doing tours and some just walking aroun
"August 16, 2023",Interesting but gruesome ,"The stories during the tour were fascinating. Our tour guide had the perfect dry sense of humor. Much respect. I would only caution parents that the stories are gruesome due to the history of beheadings, torture and persecution. One of our group even fainted lol. All that said, the crown jewels and artifacts are amazing and I very much enjoyed the visit."
"August 15, 2023",Tower of London with beefteater tour,"the beefeater tour was just a quick  intro in the chapel of a really huge crowd.nothing more. we were expecting a short guided tour of the place @least with points on what to see and where to go...and we aited 30 minutes just for that.we were more on our own, had we known we couldve started going around as easrly as we were there before it got crowded as we waited over 30 min. for the beefeater to show up."
"August 15, 2023","Interesting, but expensive and crowded","Expensive visit, but there is a lot of content, most of which was fine. Some interesting history, but nothing that wowed me. It was also very crowded when we went."
"August 15, 2023","Good for adults, could do with thought for younger children ","It's a very interesting place to visit and I would recommend to any adults or teenagers. We visited with a 7 and 5 year old but there is little to interest them, some activities /talks / colouring in pack pitched at their age would make a huge difference.Also the tickets (which are expensive) don't come with audio guide which costs extra. They is unusual and feels like something that should be included. "
"February 27, 2020","Obligated visit, fun and cultural value","The place by itself it is amazing and the guided tour is so fun and short so you can discover the rest of the places at your own pace. Now you HAVE TO SEE the crown jewels. You can not really imagine that until you see it. If you are visiting multiple places a great advise is to purchase the Historic Royal Family Annual Membership. We actually save 1.5 entrances entering the London Tower, Kensington palace and Hampton Court "
"November 13, 2022",London Tower,"Didn’t have the chance to visit the inside of the London Tower or fully walk the grounds. I arrived in the area at 7am for sunrise when most sites for tourism don’t open until 10am. From the outside it was a very nice structure to view, it’s very well maintained and compliments the Tower Bridge very well."
"April 26, 2022",Finally I managed to tour the Tower of London.,We had an amazing and very informative tour with Yeoman Scott Kelly . It was by chance we were there on  the Queen’s birthday so he had his special red tunic on . He was extremely amusing and his delivery was very clear . He was fantastic with the children stood around him. He really engaged with them.  We were so chuffed he was running our tour as I follow him on Beefy 409 after watching the “Inside the Tower of London “ series on TV. Thank you #Beefy409 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
"January 31, 2020",Amazing ,"What an amazing place to visit. Definitely worth taking the tour with one of the Yeomen. There were so many historical facts I had no idea about. A visit to the Chapel where three of our Queens are laid to rest, and a personal place of worship of our current Queen. The Crown Jewels were a sight of absolute beauty.We booked online tickets which were £6 cheaper and booked on the same day. "
"September 18, 2022",History Lovers' Delight,"No matter your views on monarchy or the British Empire in general, this is a very interesting place to explore history. The crown jewels alone are worth the visit, but the tours provided by the Yeoman Warders will truly provide context around the evolution of Great Britain. The New Armouries Cafe is also a delightful place to have a scone and tea or a full lunch. Take your time and absorb the experience."
"April 8, 2022",Overpriced but very cool,"The exhibits within the Tower of London complex are all very interesting and well designed (Crown Jewels, Armory, Church, Museum, etc). However, with such a high price and the only truly unique thing inside being the crown jewels themselves, I'd evaluate if its truly worth it to you or would be better to just look at the outside. If you do go, definitely do the free guided tour - it was great!"
"May 3, 2023",Magnificent - but not during holiday week,The Tower of London was massive and impressive.  We did a self-guided tour which was good because we could move around at our own pace.  There were plenty of signs and items on display.  I would strongly urge not to visit during a holiday (we were there at Easter) or when school is otherwise out.  The Tower itself is a treasure.
"September 17, 2020",Mdg has terribl,"Mdg has terrible service, they wasted my time for several days and then they canceled my order after the funds for the down payment cleared successfully from my account because...  of a mistake they made. The account we originally had on file couldn't make ACH Transactions so we changed it to one that could and I was told everything was successful and I'd be receiving my order within 2 weeks. Not only did they cancel my order but they never reached out to me. I would highly recommend avoid doing business with mdg.read more"
"July 12, 2023",A Tower with History,"Wonderful place to visit, the history and stories related to the Tower of London is staggering.Like most popular attractions get there as early as possible. Especially if you want to see the Crown Jewels as line gets crazy quickly.Would highly recommend taking a guided tour to start with then explore at own leisure after that.Certainly the must see attraction in London."
"May 25, 2022",brilliant,"great full day out and too much to see in one day. get there early and wait for the tour by Scott Kelly  and scottish Beefeater /warden , he made a good tour great and the kids loved the theatrical tour and oratory. Well done Scott!"
"October 25, 2023",Nice for a quick visit.,"Went here on a whim on our visit to London, tickets were easy and quick to book online, with information about ticket types. Grounds were well kept and maintained. You could walk around the main outside of the building in one big circle, so that helped not being lost on where you were going and missing parts - quite obviously, there are small, winding stair cases at points, just something to be aware of. There were some Halloween aspects set up around the grounds, these were fab, and it's something I wish there was more of as the displays were nice. We didn't elect for the crown jewels tour, a) as the queue was too long which is to be expected, and b) we just weren't interested. Walking around the grounds took us about 2 hours, and with other things to do nearby this is great to pop in and do something for a short while.Wait staff in the café could have been a little friendlier - the lady that did serve us went to do something, came back and I didn't even know we were being seen to until she asked us if that was everything we wanted."
"October 18, 2023",It’s a UNESCO site for a reason,"I would put this on your definitely must see list. Couple of tips you really don’t need the audio guide added some value but not that much. Definitely do the beefeater tour. The second tour of the day has half the people as the first tour of the day they start at 10 and run every 30 minutes so it’s easy to take number two.We were told to go to the crown jewels first thing actually on a Wednesday in October. That’s the only time of the day there was a line so it doesn’t look very crowded. When you enter the park I might give it a few minutes to clear out also. Easy to take the underground right to the facility again, this is what I would call a definite do"
"January 24, 2023",Superbloom or not!,"Our expectations were not high when visiting Superbloom at the Tower of London.  We had seen the gardens from a distance and read the reports in the press so was not expecting much.We visited towards the end of Superbloom when there was no entrance charge. We had to use the stairs to enter the site (there is also a step free entrance) as the slide was closed (we did visit during the period of mourning for Queen Elizabeth 2 where, being a Royal Palace, fun activities were probably suspended).Well, what can I say other than we enjoyed our visit.  The gardens looked a lot better close up and whilst a lot of the flowers had died back there was still some left.  The piped background music gave some atmosphere and there was still plenty of staff around to answers questions.  Many benches throughout the garden provided ample opportunities to sit, relax and to enjoying the early autumn sunshine and the views.Even when in full bloom I think the entrance fee was probably a bit high and the souvenirs were very expensive  (at full price) but being end of season everything was on offer and we got some bargains.Being Historic Royal Palaces members we also visited the tower briefly – it is so good just to be able to pop in for a short while; see a part of the castle we have not visited for a while; have some refreshments then to use the facilities before heading off to see one of the many other attractions in the areas (e.g. Leadenhall Market, St Katherine Docks, Butlers Whalf, St Dunstan in the East Church Gardens."
"July 6, 2022",Fabulous Superbloom,"Absolutely wonderful experience walking through the moat to see all the wild flowers.  We even went on the long bumpy slides (and we are great-grandparents) - very scary but great fun. Thoroughly recommend it.  The visits are timed so, although busy, you did not feel too crowded or rushed in any way."
"June 1, 2022",Great day at the Tower,We had a brilliant day at the Tower. Thanks to the advice given on this site we chose to go and see the Crown Jewels first (at around 10.30) and were able to walk straight in... later in the day the queue was pretty huge! Would definitely recommend the free Yeoman Warder talk - very entertaining and informative for all the family. I was only expecting us to stay until early afternoon but we were still there at around 5pm - there really is lots to see and do so allow lots of time for your visit.
"October 9, 2021",Terrific Tower,Spent 6 hours here and could have done at least another 2. What an amazing place and they must have opened up more of the battlements and turrents since I last visited years ago. The Crown Jewels are still awesome and we were so lucky not to have to queue although i think the pre booking has improved the visit experience as it was far better without crowds of people and shuffling around. The Beefeater tour was entertaining and a must as they really do give you an insight into its history.  Loved the interactive part of the White Tower where we tried our hand at dressing the king and shooting a cannon. Views across the Thames were of course amazing. It was certainly well worth the admission price. It gives Goosebumps to think you are treading in the same place  as past king and queens - and very poignant moments in the chapel thinking of those executed. A must for everyone.
"May 24, 2021","See the Crown Jewels, the ravens","See the Crown Jewels, the ravens, Bloody Tower, Medieval Palace, battlements, the public outside areas of the Tower of London and magnificent armour displays in the White Tower, including Line of Kings. All other buildings remain closed. Meet our Yeoman Warders positioned along the one-way route and hear their captivating stories about the history of the Tower."
"October 26, 2023",Very cool history!,"This was one of my favorite visits on my trip! Coming from the US it's amazing to stand in buildings that were built more than a thousand years ago. We arrived in time for the beefeater tour. It was very crowded so sometimes it was hard to hear the guide, but he was very informative and funny. One of the ravens walked right up to me too! The queue for the Crown Jewels was quite long but once you get inside there is plenty of room to wander. They have other artifacts on display before you get to the main event, and you can take your time and ride the moving sidewalk as many times as you like. We also visited the chapel where Anne Boleyn is buried.My group left earlier than I would have liked, but it is a lot of walking on uneven paths. I recommend to arrive early and try to see as much as you can!"
"April 29, 2022",The Crown Jewels,"Had a great day at the Tower of London, what a rich history. The Yeoman’s were very knowledgeable and very friendly. Highlight for me was seeing the Crown Jewels up close, wow they are incredibleWould highly recommend but allow plenty of time for your visit"
"December 23, 2021",Superb,If there was one good thing about this dreadful Covid situation it's that London is so quiet at the moment so my family and I took the opportunity to finally visit  the Tower Of London. During our visit it was very quiet which meant we had a better chance to see all the wonderful things they have and loved walking around the battlements. All the staff we met and spoke to were wonderful and gave us great tips on less obvious things to look out for. Thank you for a memorable experience!
"August 3, 2022",See the crown jewels!,Wee opted not to take a tour and just go on our own.  It was broiling hot outside but the interiors of the tower are reasonably cool.  You are provide with a map upon arrival and it is very easy to negotiate your way around depending on where your interests lie.  The crown jewels are a definite must-see but so many of the aspects of this amazing property are fascinating.  Enjoyed it very much.
"July 22, 2021",Yeoman Warder Tour with Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly hashtag Beefy409 ,"When in London come on down to the Tower of London. Come and explore the vast wealth of history that is buried within the inner and outer walls. A must do is a Yeoman Warder tour. I would highly recommend having a tour with none other that Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly hashtag Beefy409. If you want blood, sweat, shock horror and gore and I mean gore then he is your Yeoman to give you it all. Well worth it and then you can explore the rest of this Royal Hostorical Palace in your own leisure. You will get a glimpse of the Crown Jewels, see the Ravens and the guards. There is something for all ages. You can even have a photo with your favourite Yeoman Warder.."
"August 17, 2023",Suprisingly Good,We were slightly late that morning but we didn't miss out on the tour. We joined a Beefeater tour! The best tour we had on our trip. He gave all the gruesome details but balanced that with a great sense of humor. I overheard an American tourist tell her child that British people have a very different sense of humor based upon word play. I love that sense of humor - it is a very intelligent sense of humor. We also spent time in the cafe - the food was fantastic and all the food was labelled for allergens. My son also went and spent time with the ravens and was very impressed with that exhibit as well.
"July 21, 2023",Go somewhere else!,"10'oc in the morning and the place was well on its way to being jammed packed. Twice took audio back as it wasn't working , 3rd time gave up and just went with the flo of reading what was available on walls. Most rooms had nothing in them apart from written history on walls.. crown jewels was a nightmare with no control of crowds and pushing and shoving. Queued for about 25 mins...Can't tell you how many times I got attacked by a pushchair!. Got round the whole place in about 2 hrs and every beefeater we spoke to was so polite. Thank god for them ! but absolutely would not go back, total waste of money spoilt by no crowd control."
"November 12, 2021",Beautiful day overall but I do hold a grudge,"Absolutely beautiful place to visit with so much interesting information and history to learn, beefeaters  all very helpful and we really enjoyed our time there. Great value for money and the children loved every part of it, my only issue was with a rather large round person who seem to be called spike ( sure that’s not what his mother named him ) anyway very very rude and patronising who seemed to have a rather high opinion of himself and was rude and offensive to quite a number of people in the crowd that day. He really let himself down and the team around him because of his behaviour ! I’m thinking he is someone who thought he was way more important than he actually was.Because of how he made people feel I would not return  but other than that easy to get to and a lovely day out."
"April 3, 2022",Tour with friends,I visited here on Friday 1st April 2022 we had a very informative and humorous tour with Gary. Highly recommend for a good day out in London. We also got a good deal on days out 2for1 tickets
"November 3, 2022",Tower of London,We spent several hours at the tower of london. So much history and the people there to assist you were great. The way it is set up it is easy to get around. We recommend the audio tour which was very interesting and told us about things in depth which was really nice. If you go plan on 3 hours to just see everything that is available to see. 
"November 15, 2021",Go see the changing of the guards!,"Definitely on the top 10 list of places to go in London. The changing of the guards is a must-see too. Funny how they say “who comes there” instead of “who goes there”…makes total sense, as they explained….we don’t care who is going, we want to know who is coming."
"February 3, 2020",The Dark Side of London's History,"Very informative. The Yeomen Warder (beefeater) guide was funny as hell! Dry British Humor at its best! Every brick and stone has a history worth hearing. Don't spend your time taking selfies, try to take in all what the beefeater is saying, it really is really interesting. Once the tour is done, then you can go about with the selfies, for instagram's sake. Great tour. Great Guide. All-around worth every cent (or pence)."
"August 21, 2023",Worth visiting,"Great experience, the collection of the crown jewels was magnificent and worth the wait in the long line.There is a cafe where you can order different types of food.I've spent a few hours at the place, but you can easily spend the whole day there if you go to all the exhibitions."
"January 2, 2020",Great place to bring history alive,"I went in half term in October with my 6 and 12 Yr old. My 12 Yr old was learning about William the conquer, so visiting the tower really helped bring the subject alive for him. As a family we love history, so the Wardens tour again helped bring the subject alive, especially when he used my 12 Yr old to demonstrate beheading, which both my kids thought was brilliant. Visiting the church and seeing the names of those killed at the tower was particularly thought provoking for us all. Didn't have to wait too long for the crown jewels, no longer than 30 mins. It's one of London must see buildings."
"June 2, 2022",Challenging,"We visited the tower on 30th May 2022. We were quite disappointed as the place is not very wheelchair friendly. There are to many cobbles and you can’t visit many things in there because they are all accessible by stairs. Whilst we got the carer ticket free which is good, it is still expensive if the only things you can see are outside."
"January 17, 2023",So Much History,We took this tour using our London Pass.  The tour guides are very unique...ex military with distinguished service records.  The guided tours give you a very good 45 minute high level history tour.  You can then self tour the grounds/building including seeing the Crowned Jewels.  Overall a very good tour.
"March 13, 2022",Well worth the admission,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and found the staff very helpful.The portholes for taking photos were really helpful and the views on a clear day were excellent. The glass floor was fascinating, if slightly unnerving but the younger generation seemed to be thrilled by the ceiling mirrors."
"August 13, 2022",All pomp & crown Jewels.,We pre - booked  for 10.30 ..but got in for 10.00 so a bonus for us as it meant we could go and beat the queues for the Crown Jewels.. was it worth it !!??? It was ok !? As for the rest of the tower again its not overwhelming but with the odd changing of the Guard and the obligatory Beefeaters walking around not much to get to excited about or you may  fancy a drink or a bite to eat in the overpriced cafe ....still its a must do when in London-and still worth a visit
"May 3, 2022",Tower of London.. Scott Kelly Beefeater ,"Absolutely amazing experience here today. Would highly recommend it, I came a few years ago but wanted to come back to listen to the Beefeaters tour. We had the Beefeater Scott Kelly who was fantastic. In fact can I just say how fabulous they all, are so informative and happy to chat with everyone."
"April 4, 2023",Great Experience,"Great place. Definitely reccomend a tour by Beefy409 he was amazing, really put his all into the tour and eveyone loved it.Lots to see and do, it was busy but everywhere is in London so not sure why people moan about this. Great place to visit."
"July 14, 2020",Amazing ,"Very much enjoyed our trip to the Tower of London-our tour guide was very funny and had a lot of information to give us-he answered all our questions very well. Even though it was raining, it was a very enjoyable visit and lovely views over to the London Bridge. Great gift shop with a good range of stuff and a nice café to. Enjoyed the horse museum upstairs and also the walk around the walls."
"April 19, 2022","Family trip to the Tower of London, in the Easter Holidays.","A Family trip ( 2 adults 2 children) on a Wednesday morning, during the Easter Holidays.Prepaid and booked a family ticket, which was easy to collect no queue.Straight in through the front gates staff were friendly and welcoming, again no queue. Once inside we shot straight into see the Crown Jewels, glad we did because a little later the line to get in was enormous.Spent just over 3 hours there and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. You could easily spend a day in there but I would say 3-4 hours will cover the main attractions and general experience."
"November 23, 2023",Tower of London tour.,"Started promptly at 11:30, quite a small group of about 35, and led around by Yeoman warden 420 GaryMcCormick was both fascinating and informative. I don’t know if they have to pass exams to do this job but his knowledge is immense. Humour also arrived but unfortunately some people don’t have experience of army humour. All in all a fantastic experience led by a devoted guy to the job. Ps no I don’t work there!"
"February 16, 2023",Yeoman Warder tour was super,"Excellent visit to the Tower of London with our teens. The Yeoman Warder tour with Mark was excellent. Just the right amount of humour and fact thrown in. He really entertained us all and the time flew. Didn’t go to Crown Jewels as Q was long and saw them previously but they are worth a visit. We got 2 for 1 entry using the deal through the national rail tickets so check that out as it really saved us a lot of money. The cafe is good, quite pricey so we just had a coffee but nice space to take a breather. Highly recommend a visit to the Tower of London."
"February 20, 2020",The tour,This is one of the few places you should absolutely not miss in London. The fact that the Tower of London was built a 100 years ago! It has so much history to it. Literally just going there will get you on top of the last 1000 years of british history. The crown jewels were also amazing!
"April 6, 2023",Awful,"Visited the Thursday before Good Friday. Although we had pre-booked, we queued for some time to get in. The Beefeater tour we were taken on was absolutely rubbish. It was spitting with rain, so instead of taking us around the site, we were ushered into the chapel and given a very long winded talk - and that was literally the tour! We then had to queue for 90 minutes just to see the Crown Jewels. Badly organised and far too crowded! I really would not advise any family with young children to visit during the school holidays, they will be bored to tears. Honestly (unless you love crowds and long queues) stay away during tourist season. For that price - MUST DO BETTER!"
"July 28, 2021",Family day out and definitely visit if going to London,Fantastic visit to the Tower of London. Great for all ages. We have a teenager and 7 year old. Definitely recommend waiting to have the tour with the beefeaters. When  you enter the site you will see a board for the next time. Definitely worth the money. We spent 3 hours at the site. Cafe on site or you could bring a picnic and have after you leave over looking the Thames. Lots of walking and stairs if you do have little ones or have mobility issues. If you are visiting the Tower not much close by in terms of other attractions apart from the Sky Garden which I highly recommend. You will need to book a slot for this too.
"May 7, 2023",A must-see for any visitor to London,"The Tower has a long and fascinating history, and it is truly amazing to explore the grounds and learn about its past. It is also incredibly beautiful, with its walls and towers standing proud against the skyline. The Tower is also home to the Crown Jewels, which are truly stunning and an absolute must-see. The Tower of London is a great place to explore and learn about the history of the city. It is well-preserved, beautiful, and truly iconic. It is an experience that you won't forget!"
"May 30, 2022",One to see but on a nice day,"I've done quite a few tourist activities in London and do feel this was entertaining however , I think it does have to be nice weather as a lot of the area is outside and if like on our visit, it rains, it does cut the activity down. I would however say it's a very iconic place to go and the history or the place truly is interesting.Ticket cost is mid range which is to be expected for a tourist attraction."
"February 17, 2022",Great experience for all of the family. Make sure you do a Beefeater’s tour,"Great experience … Scott the Yeoman was easily 11 out of 10… he really made today the best day of our half term…. Informative , gory, fun & had everyone’s attention with a perfect delivery of historical stories & facts. Thank you Scott… Thank you Tower of London team … what an awesome day…."
"May 13, 2022",THE best thing we did in London.,"If you have only one day in London, this is THE ONE PLACE TO VISIT.   So much history in this spot and so many things to see and stories to hear!  We did the audio guides and they were well worth it but they were not well planned out. But THE best thing at the Tower are the Beefeater tours. Our guide, John, so informative and SO FUNNY!  It was the best thing we’ve done in London.  Definitely go early when it opens and go directly to the Crown Jewel exhibit. When you pass all the stations that hold the queue for getting to see them you’ll be happy to go right to the jewels with no crowd."
"June 21, 2020",Interesting Historical Location,"This is an interesting and educational site to visit. There is something for adults and children. Recommend arriving early and purchasing tickets online. If you want to see the crown jewels, GO THERE FIRST! The lines tend to be long. It is worth taking the free large group tour of the site, then I suggest exploring on your own. I loved the ravens!!"
"July 15, 2022",Don’t Let Summer Crowds Deter You,"The Tower of London is a truly fascinating place of world history. The grounds are well-kept and wheelchair-accessible, which allowed me to snap wonderful photos of the grand exterior at all angles. I enjoyed the signposts along the paths that gave neat info about the building. My only regret was not entering the Tower itself—next visit, when I go during the off-season! The area is definitely packed during the summer, and since I was in London amid the Jubilee festivities, things were even tighter—and I believe some places in the Tower were even cordoned off. Check out the Tower of London and put it high on your London bucket list, but know when to go so you get the most out of your experience."
"January 3, 2020",Daytrip,"We visited on our trip to London and this is a must.  We arrived and a Yeoman talk was just about to begin just through the entrance, think they're every half hour. Anyway Beefeater Dan was the man. Very funny and informative just what you want from a tour guide. Yes there is a dark side to the stories, but it's history and we've moved on.... Or have we. The history of the executions and gory details of our past is fascinating. I personally enjoyed the talk, where everyone was fair game especially the talker himself. So well done there. A 2 hour queue for the crown jewels...didn't make that but toured the rest and was thoroughly satisfied. We really enjoyed our trip and would recommended to all, except people without a sense of humour, don't do the talks, just in case you get easily offended. Get an audio guide and enjoy that tour instead. "
"November 16, 2023",The Early Entry Tour was the way to go.,"I got us the Early Entry Tour that included the Key Ceremony and the Tower Bridge Tour for my girlfriends birthday.  It was roughly a 3 hour experience and it was worth it.  There was nobody inside when we were there and almost nobody in the Crown Jewels are at all.  The Tower Bridge was an added bonus.The amount of history and the artifacts that are on display is amazing.  The French cannons from the battle of Waterloo are displayed.  There are torture devices, there are execution equipment, there are weapons and armor, and a massive amount of artifacts that have been involved with the history of the Tower.  The seemed to never discard anything that could have historic value.  It was a fascinating place to visit and definitely a Bucket List place for us.  Having a guide to explain much of what we were seeing around the grounds was excellent.  We are already talking about a return trip to London someday and if we do, we will visit the Tower again and really soak it in.  The only downside to a tour is that they will move you along to the next point of interest.  As someone that takes a lot of pictures, I could have spent half the day there."
"June 14, 2022",Great journey through 1000 years,"A really nice experience both if you are interested in history or not. Several different exhibitions, Crown Jewels, armory, military, monarchy and then the building itself. You can spend hours and hours if you like just walking around but we made it in two and were very satisfied. This is one of the highlights I would recommend Tia first visitor to london. The area just outside is filled with street food trucks and bars, nice to just sit by the river and relax after the trip in the castle."
"February 4, 2020",Wonderful Tour and a must for visitors ,I went here with no expectations or knowledge of what was in the Tower. I joined the tour that was included in the ticket and learnt so much about the history of London. The tour guide who’s name was Briggs was very entertaining and informative. I would highly recommend this as an attraction to see in London. 
"January 21, 2021",Such a beautiful place with a rich history,An interesting walk down the history lane. The guided tour was quite informative and provided a well rounded tour of the place. Lots of old artifacts are present in there which take you wayyy back in time. A good place to visit if you're visiting London for a few days.
"January 11, 2020",Beefeater tour guide ,Our guided tour was lead by a Mr Kelly. It was truely exceptional. Not only was the tour informative but filled with humour that had the whole group laughing and participating.We enjoyed ourselves al lot and will definately recommend a visit to the Tower of London.Scott Kelly = Top man....
"January 9, 2020",Interesting historical site,"Going in the middle of summer was HOT. Didn't get to see the Crown Jewels because the line was very long and I didn't want to stand for over an hour in 30°C heat.The Beefeater was great, very funny and extremely knowledgeable.Grounds and buildings looked to be in very good condition. "
"August 2, 2022",Show up early for no wait for Crown Jewels,We did not do the beefeater tour. We bought tickets for the opening time to see the tower and Crown Jewels. We arrived 30 minutes prior to opening and were one of the first people in line to see the crown jewels with no wait. The rest of the sites were informative and interesting. I would recommend this experience.
"November 28, 2021","History from Normans, Tudors to present day all under one roof",History from the Normans to Tudors to current day all under one roof. Moving history of the Queens of England who never left the Tower. Carvings in the walls were very thought provoking. Toilets very clean.
"March 3, 2020",Queer lives matter too!,I saw the special tour discussing LGBT lives at the tower was coinciding with my Trip to London and knew I just had to go. I took my sister with me (who had been living in London for sometime but had never gone into the Tower). It was fantastically well organised and a lot of fun. Plus it was a truly magical experience to see the tower at night in a more intimate setting. It was fascinating to hear about the sodomy laws and the effect these laws had on everyone from the crown down and the tribute at the end was touching!
"October 2, 2021",A very good day out,"A very good day out at the Tower of London.  We had a tour with Scott ( beefy 409 if we remember correctly) which was entertaining.  Getting the history of the Tower.Seeing the Crown Jewels, of which we heard people saying  ‘Are they real?’  We laughed, did they not notice the access doors to this section.It takes a full day to see everything, so be sure to have everything that you need."
"January 13, 2020",Very interesting,"Great place to visit, even if crowded (seems to be unavoidable in London). We arrived late in the day and only had 2.5 hours to explore, so our last 20 mins were quite rushed. Allow at least 3 hours."
"August 22, 2023","Yeoman Warders guide, Tower of London","Attended one of the Yeoman Warders guides. Excellent!!! Nev the Yeoman guide has only been in the role for a few months, his knowledge and enthusiasm was brilliant. Fully recommend this if you want to learn a bit of English history, and meet to interesting characters…. "
"August 2, 2023",Getting locked in the tower....BRILLIANT!!!!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Tower of London. We were lucky enough to experience the tower during the day and at night during the Ceremony of the Keys (a must do if you can get tickets!).The crown jewels were brilliant, especially so soon after the King's coronation. It helped to give context to each of the pieces we saw up close. There is a line to see the jewels but it moves quickly. A tour with a Yeoman Warder is an absolute must! Nev, our Yeoman Warder, was not only very entertaining but also a font of interesting facts about the tower. The passion Nev and his fellow Yeoman Warders have for their roles is fantastic! Loved the jokes as well!You will not be disappointed when visiting the Tower of London! If only they offered sleepovers!"
"September 27, 2020",Great few hours exploring,"I was first in the queue as the Tower opened at 10am. There is a ceremony you can see if you are at the front of the queue. Well worth exploring all the areas, although it is worth noting some areas are closed due to COVID."
"September 19, 2023","Very disappointed, not accessible","We get inside the grounds only to find it is totally inaccessible to wheelchairs!After commenting to 3 Beefeaters and none offering any advice, one lady volunteer overheard my conversation and took us to the front of a huge long line at the Crown Jewel building where the ""only"" ramp in the entire venue was. The place is so highly overrated and not worth the price of admission."
"February 3, 2020",Worth a visit!,Lived in London for a number of years and finally managed to visit. Definitely recommend a tour with the beef eaters specially “Shady” (don’t go on the name - he’s a gem of a person).London tour incomplete without this tour!
"October 22, 2022",Wonderful place to visit with a couple of young boys,It was a lovely summer day when we took our grandson and one of his friends to visit The Tower. We all enjoyed it and managed to see most of the attractions. Everything is well set out and there is plenty of explanation available to make it truly accessible.
"October 31, 2022",Mixed feelings ,"Unfortunately the place is very very busy, packed qith people. Maybe less people should be let in within time slots. The tour with one of the yeomans was great, however the meeting point and the hours are nowhere to be seen. Then I got easily bored and tired, going from one place to another in the crowd. There is so much history involved but the building itself is not very interesting. Unfortunately we had to give up to see Crown jewels, because the queue was unbelievable. I have never seen such a long queue in my live and I remember communist times when we queue for everything. "
"November 30, 2021",magnificent tower and fortress,"you can easily spend 1-2 hours here to visit the different areas of the Tower. Most of the areas are open for public and you can also join some of their guided tours if you catch the time well when you arrived.The tower is located near to the subway so it is easy to travel there. however, there are some places that you need to climb up the narrow spiral stairway which might be challenging for elderly"
"October 31, 2023",A fabulous day out,"This is the second time visiting the Tower of London and still enjoyed it as much as the first.The ticket included the Beef Eater tour and Crown Jewels. We left the tour after the first 40 minutes after the chapel because it was difficult to hear what the tour guide was saying, so we made our own way round and took our time.Could easily stay a full day exploring it all.Well worth the visit and value for money."
"December 26, 2022",No time to see any exhibitions,"I had a very bad experience because they sell tickets for 15:30 and 16:00 and once you get in at those times, you get informed they are closing all the exhibitions. So all you can do is wander around the inner gardens. I am sure the exhibitions are amazing, but I wasted my money. Please, stop selling tickets at those times so people don't get disappointed."
"February 3, 2021",The mighty Tower of London,This place tells some stories which is why it's worth while waiting for the  guides which takes place through out the day.the Castle grounds are kept  immaculate as you would expect.This site must of been daunting for the visitors who entered the Traitors Gate from the River Thames.Don't miss the Crown Jewels as well as the other showrooms.This Castle and the nearby Tower Bridge look and go so well together.
"January 10, 2020",Excellent historical site to visit in London,"We loved our visit to the Tower of London.We arrived in time for the excellent Yeoman Warden's tour with Yeoman Warden Scott Kelly. He provided entertaining insight into the history of the site. We giggled and gasped our way around the various locations. Following that we visited the Crown Jewels, the battlements and the armoury. We were impressed with how beautiful and well maintained the site is. The exhibits are well presented and easy to get to, although stairs are involved in places like the battlements and the White Tower. We had lunch in the cafe. The food was excellent with hearty portion sizings. We did not have time to see everything so we would happily come again."
"July 10, 2022",Bigger than expected,"As you walk in you are welcomed by the Beefeaters. We made our way straight to the Crown Jewels exhibit as the line was long. Be prepared to wait. Whilst it was interesting and great to see the jewels, you weren’t actually able to view for long as people were streaming past. No photos either. You can walk around the top of perimeter wall, where we were surprised to see that people actually lived within the Tower grounds. The White Tower and the other exhibits were fascinating and informative. You could spend hours here. The grounds were huge, much bigger than I expected.We were also please to see the changing of the guards."
"February 29, 2020",Wow what a place,"Recently visited with a friend while in London. I have been before as a child but had limited memories so as a big history especially Tudor fan it was time to visit again. It's a massive place so wear comfortable clothes and footwear, so many steps! So much to see inside. The queue for the crown jewels was long but it did flow so didn't feel too bad, however once through the door don't believe your queue is over because it continues inside for longer. Staff / yeoman weren't too friendly and seemed stressed, not exactly the tourist friendly staff advertised which was a shame. Beautiful place."
"April 11, 2023",Disappointing,Don’t assume that when you have a time to enter that you won’t have to queue again once you are in the grounds. We attempted the Crown Jewels queue twice - a very long queue which was not fun in the wind & rain. There isn’t actually a lot to see and no interactive elements so quite boring  in parts especially with children. The Crown Jewels were good but overall  it wasn’t  worth the cost & queuing. We wouldn’t go again & wouldn’t recommend.
"March 19, 2022",Do the Yeoman Tour and explore the White Tower,"Wasn't really sure what to expect when we first got here. There was a tour being given by one of the Yeomans what was starting a few minutes after our arrival. Since we had the extra time to spend and it was free, we gave it a shot. What a fortuitous decision. It was awesome. Our guide was witty and charming, providing excellent detail that was a great supplement to what you get when visiting the rest of the parts of the grounds on your own. Crown Jewels were nice too, if you're into that sort of thing, but the White Tower is where it's at. You could spend a great chunk of time in this tower, which unfairly gets overshadowed by the more famous Bloody Tower."
"January 2, 2020",Tower of London,"Spent over 4 hours there and some of the time was for lining up, especially the Crown Jewels. The guided tour gave a very good introduction. The Crown Jewels well worth the wait, and we waited until late afternoon when the line was shorter, still over half an hour to get in."
"February 10, 2020",The bloody tower,"Important place in British history, fearsome history. Having lived in London for many years I finally went to visit. Look at your leaflet immediately to choose a free tour, they are worthwhile although in the beefeater tour we chose there was too much standing around for my back.The ravens don’t leave because their wings are clipped which shocked me. Allow a few hours to absorb the written information and see everything. Take snacks. Ask questions of the helpful, friendly staff."
"May 7, 2022",Worth to visit,"One tourism „must-be“ in London. Good access by Underground next to Tower Bridge. We ordered tickets the same day morning over internet. There are also some special packages a la 2-3 places with more discount available but we did not see a point to have a kind of obligation to plan our Lonton-stay too much upfront. A great place to visit if you are interested in history, royal families and jewellery, arms, castles."
"October 27, 2023",My favorite attraction,We visited in September and the queue for the crown jewels was very small. You can easily spend the whole day in this place. There is a lot to see and explore. The lunch in their cafeteria was excellent. In between exhibits you can enjoy the park. It is simply amazing!
"February 26, 2020","Stunning day out so much more than just the crown jewels, the white tower alone is a magnificent attraction",This has to be the best value tourist attraction in London. We visited in February which is in the middle of the off season so no ques and yet we still took 4 hours to get round. Amazing historical venue that makes you appreciate architecture and craftsmanship from 1000 years ago. The jewels are incredible but the white tower and what it holds are simply incredible. Do visit his place
"January 18, 2020",Great historic palace,"This is a great attraction to see with so much to see and do. The crown jewels are a great part and they are so great. The yeoman warden tour is great, it is very entertaining and full of great history. The yeoman warder was very entertaining and i really enjoyed. This is a great attraction for all. Well worth a visit.  "
"January 18, 2022",Off with her head,Great day out. Worth every penny. Make sure you take a Beefeater tour.. very informative and entertaining.  Its a bit of a queue to see the crown jewels and they could prob use the queueing space once inside a bit better but the jewels are stunning and the ravens and people spotting kept the wait lively.  Food and drink as expected expensive and limited choice but adequate. Fun day had by all
"November 28, 2021",A brilliant day - could have spent longer!,"We had a great day at the Tower despite the chilly weather. Mark the Yeoman Warder gave a hilarious and educational tour that was definitely the highlight. The Crown Jewels were spectacular - as was the collection of armoury. We were disappointed to discover that - by buying tickets for the 12pm slot - we had just 3.5hours at the Tower, which really was not enough to do everything. Therefore if you are going I would recommend getting the 10am slot and spending all day there."
"December 25, 2022",Excellent!,"So much history. The Crown Jewels are kept here, so if there are many people visiting, go there first. We got an audio tour and were lucky to go into a church and one of the Beefeaters was speaking. He was amazing. We enjoy all the history he shared and what a prestigious branch of the service it is. Really interesting. The other thing we found amazing was the history of the ravens. What huge creature. I believe there are eight of them. They are kept there. So many parts to this tower, it was fascinating.From there we crossed the London Bridge and went to Burroughs Market."
"April 7, 2022",Walking through history,This is a can't miss during any visit to London. How often do you get a chance to walk through a building built in 1060? And such an interesting contrast to some of the ultra-modern buildings around it. And the Crown Jewels - must see. Just breathtaking 
"June 4, 2022",Packed with History,I would give yourself as much time as you can to tour around the Tower of London. The amount of history packed into this building is astonishing. I especially loved seeing the old carvings in the stone from prisoners of note. It was such a spectacular place to visit. The Crown Jewels are amazing! We had no line at all to see them. I would definitely give yourself all day to explore this amazing location!
"January 30, 2023",Lots to see,The tour is half personal guide and half self guided.  The beefeaters are interesting and lively with lots of details to share and a bit of personality to go with it.  Lots of history in these buildings and lots of mystery as well.
"February 19, 2020",History Galore,"If you love history it’s a great place. Was there for a family trip enjoyed our selfs. Wandered around for a couple of hours. The signage was a little different but no issues. Did not use a tour had fun roaming on our own, but had engaging interactive experiences through out. "
"February 4, 2021",Fantastic tour during quiet conditions,"With Covid-19 restrictions in place, there was a timed entry restriction in place that allowed us to have such a comfortable and thoroughly enjoyable visit.The Tower of London is a stunning palace and fortress, full of history and tales.The breathtaking exhibits are just spectacular.Top this off with the fabulous Beefeaters, and this was a priceless visit."
"July 18, 2022",Get here early to avoid crowds!,"Definitely get here early, we had to wait in a huge line to see the crown jewels and all buildings were just crowded, making it hard to enjoy everything.That being said, loved the history here. Everything was well done, I would recommend everyone visit here at least once."
"August 20, 2021",Crown jewels and the beheaded heads who had them on.,"Not as crowded as I'd have thought. The best part was when 2 Royal Guardsman yelled at a 10 year old girl to ""let pass"" and probably scarred her for life. Other than that it's cool history. Henry VIIIth et al. Wow. So much history. You go past the Crown Jewels on a conveyor belt (very good idea)"
"February 21, 2023",So much history - very enjoyable,You must do the free Yeoman guard tour (45 mins) starting every 30 mins whilst we were there. I knew very little about the tower and really enjoyed the trip. Lots to see and learn
"April 25, 2020",Bucket list place,"The first journey to London have to consist of checking out the monuments from postcards and movies, tasting the original cousine and having a chat with locals. As for the monuments we also visited the iconic Tower. Pretty spectacular and definitely not to be missed (but afterwards you won't forget it! ;))"
"February 10, 2020",The Jewel House is fantastic,"Because of membership of the Royal Palaces we went on a marvellous evening tour of the Jewel House and the Crown Jewels. 30 or so of us with canapes and wine to start the evening and then allowed to go round the Crown Jewels in our own time, unhurried and meaning that we could really soak up the history. An excellent evening without all the crowds."
"January 15, 2020",Fascinating!,"If history means anything to you, this is your place to visit! You can't help but feel the past as soon as you step foot on the grounds.   Try to arrive early morning and preferably with a tour guide.  There is so much to see and guide will make sure you don't miss a thing!   If you chose to do it on your own, be sure to see the crown jewels first.  The later it gets, the longer the line!    You can't help but feel the past as soon as you step foot on the property"
"January 17, 2020",Magnifique ,Yoeman warder tour is highly recommended. It will take almost 1 jour to listen to most of the stories happened in the tower and history of tower itself. Visiting the jewels and crowns is an amazing experience.
"October 20, 2021",Well worth a visit,Great visit here with teen and a 10 year old. We all loved it and spent quite a few hours exploring and admiring the jewels. Don’t bother with the cafe - lukewarm and expensive! Didn’t detract from the rest of the exhibits thankfully. Well worth reading the walls some fascinating yet terrifying insights to the history of the tower there. We took the hop on hop off bus out to the tower which took forever but was enjoyable as well as giving the feet a rest!
"June 24, 2020",Lovely Historical Place In The City ,Went with my son and early January this year and we were very impressed with the architecture and the up-keeping of the tower plus the Royal jewellery that was in exhibition at the time. It was lovely to see the grounds are well managed m by the resident workers and was unchanged from when the Tower was occupied. We enjoyed meandering through the buildings and passage way. I’ve been here twice but still love it.
"January 5, 2023",Fantastic yeoman mark tour,"My husband and I visited The Tower of London on the 29th of December . We did a tour with Mark the yeoman. He was amazing, so funny , engaging with all age groups. You will need a good few hours to spend here, we queued for an hour to see the Crown Jewels but all other areas there was no Queue . Definitely prebook before going ."
"September 8, 2020",One of the best days out,"My son has been learning about Henry VIII so we brought him here. The Beefeaters are always so friendly and eager to chat, but it was great visiting soon after it has reopened as there were no crowds. Although a couple of parts were still closed, there was still plenty to see and we didn’t feel we had missed out."
"January 4, 2020",Second time with family,"Top attraction for families with kids! When I came here the first time there were not so many queues for each ""attraction"". We all had fun, anyway! The interactive section and the crown jewels are the parts that most interested the children (and the adults!). You can spend here the entire day with a break for lunch.Do not miss it!"
"June 22, 2022",More than one tower,We went on the guided tour and learned a great deal of history by a jovial guide dressed in period costume. Many of the anecdotes gave a little black humor to some rather grisly events that occurred over the centuries. We also saw the changing of the guards. This was suitable for all ages.
"August 22, 2022",Not just prisoners and beheadings.,"I admit, my view of the Tower was exactly that-prisoners and beheadings. There's so much more to it than that. The beefeaters are happy to share their knowledge and information with you. While we were there, an enactment of some historical scene was happening. It's a great morning activity. "
"November 16, 2022",Beefeaters,Wife and I spent a lot of time here. This is the London I was looking for not all the ugly new buildings around. My opinion only. This was a Palace Fortress and a prison. Walking ramparts or diving into every room this place is a step back in time. You have guided and unguided tours we chose to explore on our own. Crown Jewels my god the money. Put this on your list. 
"September 5, 2020",Visit with our grandchildren,We came here today and I hadn’t been in about 25 years. My husband and I loved it but my grandchildren thought it was awesome. My granddaughter thought the Crown Jewels were her favourite as did my husband. My grandson like the artillery exhibition which had the armour and the horses. I loved the torture unit. This had some sinister items that were genuinely used as punishment from some time ago. This is probably one of the best days I have had in such a long time. 
"June 2, 2020",Best Part of My Trip,"I loved the history that fairly oozes from this place. Lots of things to see and experience, you really need a whole day to explore it all. Grab lunch at the Hung, Drawn and Quartered when you're done, and a quick visit to All Hallows at the Tower after will round off the perfect day."
"January 18, 2020",Must do ,"I loved my visit to the Tower of London, it is a place filled with history. The Ravenmasters who acts as tour guides are AMAZING, they gladly share their knowledge and are super fun. I normally like to visit the places on my own but I loved having the Ravenmasters in our group, it sure make the place even better. "
"July 1, 2021",So much to learn,"This is such a place of historic interest,  it really needs 2-3 hours to see it properly.However as I am in a wheelchair it really was not a great visit for me, you need to bear in mind the age of the place and that it really is not a site suitable for wheelchairs, cobbled streets etc.  Trying to please my husband I went along for the ride but was left sitting outside for long periods on a rather cold and overcast June day."
"November 14, 2021",Great Attraction,"There is a lot to see at the ToL.We are very quick around most attractions and we were still there 2 hours.You must go to the Crown Jewels first thing (before 10.30) if you don’t want to queue for long. Otherwise, you’ll lose an hour before you even see anything.A great way to see old and new London."
"May 3, 2023",Majestic and grand piece of history,"With its many towers, fortified walls, and royal palace, the Tower of London is a must-see for any visitor to London. From the iconic White Tower to the Bloody Tower, there are so many stories to explore. The Crown Jewels are on display, and the Yeoman Warders provide an informative and entertaining tour. The Tower of London is also home to a variety of wildlife, including ravens, which are said to protect the Tower. Whether you're a history buff or just looking for an interesting day out, the Tower of London is sure to leave you with lasting memories."
"May 23, 2022",A super trip and visit on a rainy day,One of Londons gems. I was born within a stones throw of the tower but this was the first time I visited. I found the whole experience amazing. Also it was suitable for children. I strongly recommend one of the Beef Eater guided tours. They seem able to blend history with amusement.
"May 18, 2020",A haunted experience,"The Tower of London is full of ghosts and spooky feels.  A lot has happened there through the years and no matter how sensitive or not you are, it's impossible not to feel something.  If you want an extra spooky experience come dressed up in Renaissance clothes.  Everyone will think you're part of the place including the ghosts.  It's very interesting to walk in the steps of all the people who came to have their heads chopped off."
"September 4, 2021",Plenty to see and great views,Two of us went on a bank holiday Monday morning and although busy we somehow managed to avoid the crowds so walked straight into the crown jewels room and had plenty of time to look at the exhibits. My favourite part of the complex was the menagerie exhibition as I had no idea wild animals were kept in royal palaces and we got up close and personal to a raven. Really friendly staff.
"June 15, 2022",Superbloom at The Tower,I visited Superbloom in the Tower moat yesterday. The event is late flowering and we have been offered the opportunity to revisit when more of the flowers are in bloom. Quiet and with lots of volunteers around to provide visitors with additional information.  However copper bowls covering drain covers all dried up and requiring re- filling with water. And Slide into the moat closed due to weather conditions…. Very disappointing!! Overall quite disappointed……
"June 22, 2022",Plenty to keep you busy!,"We were quite rushed for time and only entered near closing so we only saw the Crown Jewels and had the Yeoman's Tour, both of which were very good. Yeoman Warder Tom O'Reilly was our guide and he was well versed in the history of the palace. We were impressed with his knowledge and we wish him well. :) We spent the remainder of our time there wandering the grounds and it was a lovely time. Will return for a longer stay and a good look around. We were bummed that we couldn't get there earlier in the day, but we made up for it in the gift shop!!"
"September 19, 2020","Historic gaol, fortress and Palace.","Always wanted to visit, I did the trip and did so now as without the crowds especially the large tour groups, you could take your time and we enjoyed the extra space and time.we had.The crown Jewels, The Armoury and the Architecture were all just really awesome, as were the knowledgeable Beefeaters who were very welcoming. If you get the tube to Tower Hill make sure you take in the Roman wall as you walk to the Tower. The Romans chose the spot due to its unique dominant location, as did the Towers builders.."
"October 27, 2020",Glad we visited,"I’d not been to the Tower of London for years so I’m glad we finally got around to doing this. Everything was efficient and well organised. Have to admit I was slightly underwhelmed by the Crown Jewels. Although the walkway moves slowly I didn’t feel there was time to fully take them in. Staff we met were all very engaging, informative and friendly."
"August 4, 2023",Get There EARLY if in summer,"Pro Tip: get the earliest time-entry ticket possible, and go directly to the crown jewels. We walked right in, and had a nice, leisurely stroll through the amazing collection. Some items were missing, but we saw them latter in Buckingham Palace, which had much of the coronation regalia. The collection is mind-boggling, especially considering that Oliver Cromwell destroyed the previous set (an interesting story on its own).Beyond the Crown Jewels, the castle (with multiple towers) has a fantastic and ancient history. We learned a great deal during our visit. The audio tour is quite good. As an aside (far aside), we saw the musical SIX a few days prior, and it was interesting to see the connections. "
"May 19, 2022",A must see-seriously,"Very impressive.  You need to get there early because the queue for the Crown Jewels can get long.  Very impressed with all the swords & regalia. Didn't know there are 4 different crowns depending on the event.  We visited the day before the first day of Parliament, so her crown was at Parliament-not on display,"
"October 24, 2023",One of the oldest sites in the City of London ,The Tower has so many historical references. Its view on foot is probably the best as well as doing the river trip. Not only one can appreciate the architecture and how it has endured the test of time but also one can find nearby many other attractions. It is best to go early when crowded or to go at the end of the day. 
"May 21, 2022",Great day,The Tower of London was awesome. Our yeoman guide (Andy I think was his name) was super fun and informative. We learned all about the complicated past of England and the tower itself. Highly recommend taking the yeoman tour and then going to explore on your own after!
"March 14, 2022",A really informative day out,"Great day out at the Tower. I had been before but this was the first time I had brought my Primary school aged child. She loved it.We were there early and saw the opening of the doors. We explored the Medieval rooms and then went on the tour with a Yeoman Warder. The tour was fun and informative. My daughter got a bit bored, but just the same as any young child really.We saw the crown jewels, all very beautiful and informative too. We had a nice lunch at the cafe. Would recommend d a stop off there as the food was decent and well enough priced.All told we had a good time. We didn't get round half the site, but that just means we ha e to return again. "
"August 17, 2023",A-Plus Attraction,"We missed this on our first trip to London in 2015 and I always regretted it. That’s why the Tower was my #1 priority to visit this time. Our first morning on this trip, we were there.The Tower of London is everything I hoped for and more. It overflows with history everywhere you turn. I’m a history educator of over twenty years experience and even I learned a ton. No matter how many books you read, being on-scene  somewhere like this provides invaluable depth and perspective to one’s understanding of historic events.Be sure to wait for one of the guided tours led by a wonderful Yeoman Warder. They meet near the entrance at the most, run every half hour, and are included in your ticket. They take you to various locations within the tower, as well. Our Warder was Nev. Let’s put it this way: Nev rocks. In every possible way there is to rock, Nev rocks. He is a gifted showman and knowledgeable.London Tower was so much fun. I loved every moment of it. There were many cool things to see and enjoy. We even saw the famous ravens, one of whom approached me for a handout. What a magical interaction."
"January 29, 2023",A must see London Treasure,"You must visit the tower when in London.  The history is beyond insane, the Yeoman Warders are an absolute delight, just take it all in.  Had an amazing experience as a VIP to the ceremony of the keys, what an experience.   We will be back in June and again in December. "
"April 21, 2022",Very entertaining warder tour,"We visited in the last week of the Easter holidays. I know that some areas had already gone back to school, which probably helped, as it was much quieter than when we visited in August. We purchased Historical Palaces Membership a few months ago, so had not long visited. However, our warder tour with Beefy409, Scott Kelly, really made the day worthwhile. He was very entertaining and informative. This time we also didn't have to queue at all to see the Crown Jewels, which was great. The Tower is an interesting place to visit, with so much fascinating history. Then you can walk along the riverfront and see lots more of London. Worth a day out. Historical Palaces Membership covers The Tower of London, Hampton Court Palace, Kensington Palace, Banqueting House and Hillsborough Castle I Gardens, so it's worth considering that annual membership if you like to visit those places."
"October 29, 2021",Excellent day out - a part of History,"Tower of London- I would suggest going as early as possible- we went when it opened and noticed it got busier as the day went on.I got and audio tour for my child and it made it so much more interesting - (ended up telling me facts) and engaging. As you don’t have to do it in a set order it was so pleasurable. Every member of staff we interacted , met were polite and had a smile. We spoke three members of staff asking them questions each one of them had fantastic knowledge of the  Tower of London. The cafe on site had a lovely selection of food for all. Highly recommend going to explore the Tower of London. It is definitely a day out ."
"June 16, 2022",A Must-Do in London,"If you are in London, head over to the tower. Your trip is not complete without it. Be sure to plan on spending a whole morning or afternoon here. Depending on how into it you are, you could spend 3-4 hours. We were there over 2 hours and could have stayed longer if we did not have other commitments. I loved the Crown Jewels room. The best part of it all."
"July 3, 2022",Brilliant with amazing toilets!,I actually wanted to point out to those visiting that Superbloom is amazing. You have plenty of free viewing areas.  Not sure it's worth paying to go to unless you want a photo with a beefeater! Lovely experience though. However  I really wanted to mention the toilets outside the experience.  Might seem strange but even with a queue it was quick  clean and the lady  inside was friendly and cleaned each toilet quickly before ushering you in. A thoroughly great toilet experience.   Not seen such a pleasant place. Well done to them!
"September 28, 2020",Definitely worth visiting.,"We were lucky to book this visit during the pandemic which meant the queues were minimal and we nearly had the place to ourselves. The Beefeaters were engaging, the battlements offered great views but I have to say the Crown Jewels topped off the whole visit. So much history to take onboard and I certainly learned so much. I cannot recommend this visit enough and look forward to the next time when I take my children."
"June 13, 2022",A must visit if your coming to London,"Fantastic place to visit, full of history, facts and historic items.We had tickets for 10am and would recommend getting there early and heading straight to see the crown jewels before the ques start! Everywhere else got busier as the day went on but the crown jewels seemed to be the only place that a large que formed.After we jumped on the the river boat from Tower Pier, which is just outside the Tower of London, back to Westminster. Much better way to travel back up the river than getting the underground."
"August 30, 2022",Top of List for London,"I can't imagine visiting London for the first time and not visiting the Tower! Plan on a couple of hours to meander around this ancient complex which still houses the residences of the guards (Yeoman Warders). Be sure to take the Warder tour (included) which takes you into the small chapel and includes interesting anecdotes. Tip: Pre-purchase tickets for the earliest entry possible. Once there, go straight to the Crown Jewels. Afterwards go to the Yeoman Warder tour. After that see the rest on your own. BYO snacks and drinks; options are very limited."
"August 25, 2023",Tower Of London Review,"This is a must tourist attraction! It’s great to see all this history packed into one place! Loads of information about the towers, but one thing that you have to see there is the Crown Jewels! You go round on a conveyor belt, and you can look at them from a distance, but can see them clearly. It’s so interesting, and I loved going around to see it all. You need to make sure you book this, as it’s a very popular attraction to visit, and so many people come every day for this attraction, so don’t turn up without a ticket! It’s a great one for people that love history, or are  interested in history. It’s a must if your coming to London for a holiday or just a tourist visit! First time visiting and would consider doing again!"
"December 13, 2022",Really worth a visit,"After being to London so many times and always avoiding the Tower of London (as I thought it is too touristy) I gave it a go this time. How wrong I was to wait for such a long time: it is so interesting, all the history these walls and the Yeoman warders can tell, just great. I was easily spending four hours in there.... Can highly recommend it."
"June 8, 2023",Yeoman Darren is the best!,"We did the 'basic entrance with Beefeater tour' (which I didn't see in the drop-down menu), and it was fantastic! Yeoman Darren (wish I knew his last name) was so entertaining and knowledgeable. We were there with our two kids (11 and 14) and they, too, were riveted by his deep knowledge of British history."
"October 29, 2023",History overload,"This is one of the can't-miss items on a list of things to do in London.  For Americans who have a casual familiarity with British history, there are a lot of aha moments as you recognize various stories and names of monarchs who a not as visible as Henry VIII.Everybody wants to see the Crown jewels, so the line to get in can be over an hour.  Luckily for us, it was not high season so we only waited about  5 minutes in line.  Unfortunately, anything worth looking at had people piled up 3 deep which made getting any appreciable look at something almost impossible.  They have tried to alleviate this problem with the best and most important of the crowns by putting in a moving walkway past them.  They should do this for the entire collection.For history buffs, the buildings have as much fascination as the jewels."
"May 21, 2022",Always wanted to visit here - loved it!,"Important piece of history not to be missed.   It was not very crowded during our visit, which was great because some of the steps in the castle area are narrow and we had to move slowly - my husband has poor sight.   The staff were very helpful and helped us up a couple of short cuts at the White Tower.   I went through the crown jewels twice since there was no line.  Apparently sometimes there is a very long wait, but we were lucky and had no waiting at all.    A must see if you visit London."
"March 14, 2023",Good history lession,An afternoon trip to the tower of london was good to be exposed to some English royal history.The line to the crown jewels was really really long so we had to skip it. Probably best to visit first thing in the morning rather than after lunch

"May 21, 2023",Great historical visit,This is a great place to visit on a first London trip.  The history is amazing and everything is very well presented and maintained.  The audio guide helps give lots of information to enhance your journey through the various areas of the Tower.  Great views and helps with the understanding of what things were like in their time.  Staff was great and very helpful.  
"October 15, 2023",Worth a visit,We went around without a guided tour but the tower of London is easy to navigate. It was really informative and there was plenty to see. Most things were accessible and there was enough information at each stage to make it informative and enjoyable.
"October 25, 2020",Fantastic ,"Booked tickets on the morning of visit very easy. Due to covid it was a lot quieter then I've been before but I felt it was better that way. Had time to visit all the aspects that are normally too busy, tho a couple of the attractions weren't open as not able to adhere to social distancing didn't spoil the day. "
"March 6, 2020",WOW!,"Pre purchased tickets that were at will call, no lines when we visited.Pros:  Get the guide tour head phones as it provides lots of insights. Make sure you circle back to view from both sides of the Crown Jewels."
"December 8, 2022",Worth the £ and time if you have both.,"Excellent history lessons in Central London steps away from Tower Bridge and the turbulent Thames. The Crown Jewels are housed inside. Plan the time of your visit to get a short, free, and fun guided tour by one of the Yeoman Warders. Plan way ahead to possibly get in to watch the daily closing ceremony for a minimal fee. The souvenir booklet is worth the £5 in my opinion. Prepare to spend a few hours, there is a LOT to see. Wear sturdy shoes as there are cobblestones everywhere inside and outside the walls. Food is available inside and outside. There is a water taxi/river cruise to Westminster just steps away also. Tower Hill Underground station is <5 minutes away."
"September 20, 2021",10/10 - a must see in London,Amazing! I’ve wanted to visit for ages and I wasn’t disappointed . There is so much to see and do that you really need at least 4 hours to do this beautiful palace justice. We joined Andy on the yeoman warder tour and it started our visit off perfectly. He was able to whet out appetites to learn more and really explore the site fully. Definitely on the to do list again next time we visit London!
"April 12, 2020",Bigger on the inside,"I had a TARDIS-like experience walking through the Tower of London.  This castle has a long history in London: a royal residence and palace, armoury, treasury, prison, and the home of the Crown Jewels.  Keep an eye out for the ravens, as they have a special place in the Tower, and the ghost of Anne Boleyn is said to haunt the Tower as well.  We spent an afternoon exploring everything here, and every time I turned, there was something else to explore here.  It could easily take an afternoon."
"May 31, 2023",Excellent Tower of London Experience,"We visited the Tower of London on 27 April 2023. Our Yeoman Warder guide was A.J., the 2nd female Beefeater in history. She was informative and highly entertaining. If you want to tour the White Tower, just know there are MANY steps! Because we visited shortly before the Coronation, the Crown Jewels had left the building. But wandering through the various open buildings was very enjoyable.  If those walls could talk, what stories they’d tell."
"June 29, 2022",Super bloom and tower,Did Superbloom and Tower what a great day….three adults and a six year old had the best time….first was Superbloom in the moat then the Tower itself - self guided - did crown Jewell’s. Wonderful value for money can only recommend
"August 25, 2021",A London Must See,Fascinating tour around this historical palace/zoo/prison/museum. Spent approximately 3 hours exploring it and loved it. Spent a bit extra getting the headphones/audio guide which was well worth it.  A London must see!
"April 9, 2023",Awful. Staff a disgrace (Yeoman excluded),"Horrendously organised, all staff bar Yeoman disgraceful. They were rude, highly unprofessional and swearing a lot regardless of who was in earshot. Queue for the jewels so badly organised. For an iconic landmark it’s an embarrassment and a shambles. "
"August 12, 2021",Must do!,"Great day out. We arrived for 9am -queued for a few minutes to get in (ticket check) and walked straight to the Crown jewels as there was no queue at this time and not many people in at the time. Spent the rest of the time exploring the other areas.  Lots to see, lots of history, some great views and photo opportunities. Suitable for young and old."
"June 11, 2022","Awesome Visit, A Must See",Took the 45 guided yeoman tour and it was well worth it. It comes with the price of admission so take advantage. You get to learn about 900 years of history in the short 45 minute time.
"January 25, 2020",Very interesting historical place,"First time visit, not too busy in January, no queues. The beefeater tour is a must, so informative and brings it all to life. The displays in the armoury are magnificent and the Crown Jewels are beautiful. It’s a great area too, we took a 5 minute walk to St Katherine’s Dock where we had a drink in the Dickins Inn. Will definitely revisit the area. "
"April 7, 2022",A day at the tower ,"Overall I really enjoyed checking out the Tower of London. First of all the grounds are visually stunning, especially if you're into older architecture in. Once inside, it's really just a museum detailing the history of the tower. There are several things of interest there my favorite being the crown jewels exhibit. The only thing I would caution about is that there are a lot of stairs so one should be extra careful if you're older, or bringing young children. Well worth checking out. "
"December 18, 2023",Tower of London tour,A wonderful tour. The Beefeater first introduced us to the history with great humor and facts. Don’t miss this part.  Then we went out on our own to see the Crown Jewels and the tower itself. The history is fascinating and worth the time.
"April 8, 2022",Incredible journey through British history,WOW! A fantastic visit where the Beefeaters hooked us from the first moment. From 10-70yrs everyone was hanging off his every word. The Tower is an incredible building but it is the Beefeater guide who brings it to life. MUST DO experience for everyone in London.

"November 7, 2022",Great visit,"Very interesting visit. The Beefeater tour/talk was a highlight- funny yet very informative. We arrived 10am approx. headed to Beefeater first and then straight to Crown Jewels. We were glad we did, as the queue to the Jewels was enormous by the time we finished there. So much to see, we spent 6hours and still rushed parts of it. Several toilets available, and all very clean despite huge numbers using them. Definitely a top attraction.  "
"February 12, 2020",History and beautiful jewels!,So much history to learn in going to the Tower of London. Make sure to do the Yeoman  Warder walking tour-you will learn so much. The crown jewels are stunning to see along with learning their history. Grateful that we toured at a quieter time of year so we had a more leisurely view of everything.  Allow 2-3 hours to see everything. There are cafes which help in taking a break.
"November 16, 2022",Great visit!,Visited the Tower of London on a weekend trip to the capital - really enjoyed it - especially the display of the Crown Jewels.  Quite expensive but we did get two for one tickets which made it reasonable.  Definitely worth a visit. 
"June 13, 2021",Highlight of London,"Definitely one of the best places to visit. My partner is a history buff so this place was perfect. We ended up spending a good few hours at the Tower, taking our time and visiting every single area we could. Overall an amazing experience learning about the history and what had been there in the past"
"June 5, 2022",A must see destination when visiting London,"This was a wonderful historical place to tour. The Crown Jewels were incredible, the White Tower was full of history, armamentsand a small, very nice chapel. The Beefeaters are impressive and the ravens are quite large and fun to watch. It’s a must do.  "
"May 17, 2020",Great tour - Great historical facts,I enjoyed my visit at the Tower very much! The tour I attended was very insightful and I enjoyed learning about this interesting site of history. I spent about 2.5 hours here and I think it was worth to visit and the entrance fee. I would probably come back at some point to visit again.
"August 14, 2020",So much history,Booked a timed entry which worked well.  The site has our marked out routes to get around while social distancing.  This is a good time to go as there was plenty of space to look round without any crowds at all.  The Tower is packed with history and has a fantastic atmosphere - you can feel the history coming from all sides.
"February 6, 2020",Simply Amazing,"We visited here on January 24, 2020.  There is so much history here, so plan to be here for awhile.  We were able to get in quite easily using the London Pass with no wait time.  We arrived just in time for a free guided tour by a Yeoman Warder.  He was informative and quite humerous.  Be advised that the history of the tower is quite gruesome and they don't shy away from it.  There also is quite a bit of walking.  The highlight is seeing the Crown Jewels.  The are amazing and spectacular.  Words don't do them justice. This place sould be a must stop for anyone touring London.  Just an amazing site."
"November 15, 2021",Worth the visit,"Whilst in London we decided to visit the Tower of London. It was a good experience to see the tower, the museums and the Crown Jewels. So much to see.     We also decided to have a guided tour with a knowledgeable and entertaining guide. He made everyone laugh, whilst telling us the history of the tower. Definitely worth taking up the tour."
"August 18, 2021",British History at its finest. ,"We were here on the 9th August 2021.Not crowded, probably a Covid19 aftermath.....Beefeaters are fantastic, knowledge is unsurpassed and very friendly.  The ravens are inquisitive and massive hahaThe whole site is spotless2 cafes from what I could see, although £6 for a hot dog? Visit the church of St Peter Ad Vincula.....its where Anne Boleyn and Katherine Howard are buried.The tower is a fascinating place, packed with historic events , ghostly tales and of course the Crown Jewels. "
"September 2, 2023",Wonderful ,Absolutely amazing day out my kids have loved it since watching it on the tv and were ecstatic that the raven master was the one who did our tour . Would defo recommend doing a tour to find out more info . We spent hours there great value for money 
"December 4, 2023",Worth the time and money!,"I was lucky to arrive in time to catch a free tour by one of the Yeoman Warder, who gave a great presentation.This is a very cool experience, getting to experience the infamous Tower of London.I stood on Tower Green where Anne Boleyn and Lady Jane Grey lost their heads and it was both unsettling and fascinating to be so close to history.There's so much to see and your head will quickly fill up with info!I thought I would be in and out in two hours but I was here nearly four hours, and it was worth it.The Crown Jewels are housed in a separate building in the Tower and it's a cool exhibit. Get here ASAP because the line gets long...fast!Expect to get your steps in, walking up and down a ton of steps, and ducking into narrow doorways, but it's worth it!"
"March 9, 2022",Always a must when i'm in London,"3rd time visiting and every time I have joined a beefeater tour. They are fabulous, in particular Barney. Educational, professional yet delivers the tour with a great sense of humour and also pride. I also feel really moved after a tour. Crown jewels a must see."
"July 14, 2022",Outstanding Colour,"Super Bloom :-The display is magnificent- even with the dry dry summer we are having.Do take your time, you will need an hour to an hour and a half, do sit too to admire the colour.Do take a camera !!! It is my pastime so did have a ' macro lens ' A great experience, one of the best in London at the moment."
"September 1, 2021",Great last day in london,Great attraction enhanced by the audio tour.We arrived at 1pm and stayed until 5.30 pm as we had a resavation for dinner.When feel we should have had longer and we will go earlier when we go again.Great day out and the perfect way to end our trip.
"December 30, 2022","Awful queues, unable to see the Crown Jewels",We were really disappointed in queues. I knew it woud be busy but the ticket was misinforming. We queued up for the Beefeater tour which wasn't part of the Crown Jewel tour. My mom came specifically for this reason. It was freezing cold and the queue snaked around for over an hour.
"July 11, 2022","If you want to see crown jewels, get early tickets","We went on a Saturday, which is never my favorite day at popular sites. Luckily had 9:00 am tickets and we went to Crown Jewels first. When we left at 11:00, line was, I would estimate, 3-4 hours long. Special exhibit due to Platinum Jubilee, and it is amazing, but plan accordingly."
"January 12, 2020",Best part of my euro trip!,Love love love the Tower of London! We spent over 5 hours here and could have spent more time. I did except it to be more torture-focused but turns out it wasn't haha. The Crown Jewels were amazing - do this first!!! We walked straight in and had plenty of time up close to the jewels. By noon the line was huge!
"October 28, 2021",Good,"Nice, very busy during half term there was quite a que.There is some confusion over the towers and would be good to hire out an audio for the tour which didn't come to mind when we booked. Need more than just a couple hours here as it could take most of your day seeing the history behind Tower of London. Great day out. "
"July 1, 2022",Full of history,"We enjoyed our time here, it was well worth a visit, albeit quite expensive. Great to see traditional British sights such as the Beefeaters and ravens. The Crown Jewels are well worth seeing."
"August 5, 2022",wonderful family day,great way to spend the day. the tour by the guards was fantastic and entertained my children ( ages 10 nd 16). excellent mix of fun and education. start with the crown jewels before the line gets long. the armory was pretty amazing
"September 1, 2021",Really interesting. A good few hours killed,"Very interesting and a lot to see.Really busy though as school holidays - a long queue to see the Crown Jewels. Kids loved spotting the ravens that roam around the tower. Had lunch in the cafe which was very good, but again extremely busy with quite a long wait.Worth a visit, but probably best for those with slightly older kids"
"August 9, 2022",The place to visit in London,"Bought the tickets online and went to the Tower as it was opening up. That made for a pleasant visit, being among the first to see the Crown Jewels and other parts of the place.  The place got very crowded quickly, yet there was plenty a space. There was a nice wild flower field around parts of the walls (they charge a separate ticket to walk through it). However one can get some nice pictures you exit the Tower tube station."
"July 24, 2020",Morning visit,Visited tower of london once it reopened (before most of thrn other attractions).It was very quiet and so very easy to wander around at our leisure the beefeaters were all very friendly and loved to chat.Would have given 5* but the one way only system meant certain parts aren't open currently to the public.
"October 17, 2022",Excellent and steeped in history.,We loved the Tower of London. Tip- purchase tickets online to save a trip through the ticket queue. Getting in after that was quick. The place is just steeped in history. Beautiful! Our favorite part was the raven who befriended us because I accidentally dropped a cookie bit. Haha
"February 16, 2020",Great Experience,Really enjoyed this visit it was amazing and I learnt so much. Cannot believe you can get so close to the crown jewels.  Interactive session at the end if the white tower section was the kids highlight.
"September 2, 2021",Amazing place ,Absolutely fantastic place. Full day required if possible to really appreciate and take everything in. Much larger than I expected. Incredible to be walking on the ground that so much history has taken place. A truly special place that needs to not be hurried. 
"November 20, 2023",I could have spent all day here!,"So much to see, allow plenty of time.   We were very lucky and didn’t have to queue for long at any point.  The cafe has plenty of seating and is reasonably priced.  We had so much fun walking around, joining a tour is a must (even if only for a small part of your day, lots of information delivered in a captivating way."
"August 4, 2021",Very interesting,Really enjoyed our time here. My 7 year old loved walking up all the little staircases and across the bridges. Lovely grounds. We were a bit pressed for time so skipped the Crown Jewels as the queue was quite long. Will return though.
"August 12, 2021",Amazing day out,What can we say? We loved it.  The kids loved it. We spent 5 hours here and still didn’t see it all.  We’ll just have to come back!  So much history and so many stories and legends.  And of course the Crown Jewels to top it all off. Amazing.
"July 14, 2023",Absolutely Awesome!,"We went to the Tower of London with a group of teenagers, had a great time.  We ate at the cafe, excellent food as well.  The highlight was the Ceremony of the Keys, fantastic experience one we will never forget!"
"November 18, 2022",Awesome,This is an amazing place. With all the history involved.  Queens being beheaded.  The Crown Jewels. And it’s in great shape.  The inner white tower is so so old.  When you think of the changes in the world since it was built it’s really amazing.
"April 9, 2023",Average experience with very long queue for the Crown Juwels,"Nice location, but very long queue for the Crown Juwels. Typical medieval castle, not much to see here. If you come from a country with long history and rich culture (many castles and cultural sites) a little underwhelming."
"June 16, 2022",Super Bloom-at the Tower,"We visited the super bloom flower attraction in the moat at the Tower of London today.Have to say we were very under whelmed indeed.It lacked the wow factor, along with missed opportunities.Height was needed and this could have been achieved with the use of trees, scented flowers would have been nice.  The inclusion of eco environmental sculptures   More dense planting and less expensive.  It took us precisely 15 minutes to walk around."
"December 2, 2022",Must See in London,"We took an all day Golden Tour that included the Tower.  There is so much history there: the Crown Jewels, the armory, where they chopped of Anne Boleyn's head, etc. There are the ravens, the Beef Eater guards.  It is well worth the trip to see.  Be sure to allow enough time to be able to see it all."
"July 5, 2022",Loved the Superbloom display,"Visited to see Superbloom in the moat. Stunning display of wild flowers. Hope they will keep this going as its much nicer than viewing bare grass. Also went inside to see the Crown Jewels ( bit of a wait, but worth doing) and walked the wall. Lots of interesting items on display in the various towers."
"May 30, 2022",Brilliant Beefeaters,"The Crown Jewels were amazing, well worth seeing as they are works of art.The Beefeaters were friendly, approachable, and extremely helpful - they went out of their way to make your experience memorable. A perfect example of how really good customer service should be delivered."
"July 28, 2021",Family visit,"Excellent day well laid out, we were able to visit all attractions without queuing. Lots of interesting places to visit. We saw some filing taking place. Staff were friendly and helpful and we look forward to visiting again"
"September 25, 2023",Visit whilst on London,Visited whilst on a trip to London. Only had 2 hours but managed to see most things. Very interesting historically. Beefeaters need training in customer service ( which is ultimately what their job is) bit impatient  and miserable. Most looks a bit overgrown and scruffy 
"November 5, 2023",Not the best today,"Plus points: Historic site and lots of different things to see including the Crown Jewels. Downside: staff rude and unfriendly (not the Beefeaters), not very mobility friendly (expected to not be flat/escalators etc, but asking for the easiest route should have not led to such sarcasm), gluten free cookie so hard we couldn't eat it and was just told ""I'll tell the chef"" . £4.95 wasted. Only there 1.5 hour as went early so no queues which great but meant a quick visit. "
"October 7, 2023",Excellent experience,Yeoman tour a must. So informative and entertaining. The history is mind boggling. The buildings and artifacts immaculately maintained. Great to see how other people lived and learn about our heritage. Wonderful to see the Crown Jewels.
"March 6, 2016",A good day out.,"If you love history, this is a must.  It is worth it just to see the Crown Jewels and the Ceremony of the Keys is interesting.The Beefeaters are excellent and seem happy in their work. A very informative visit – you won’t be disappointed!"
"May 4, 2006",Fascinating...and CROWDED,"The Tower of London was great--but be prepared for HUGE crowds.  I did not heed the advice of other reviewers to arrive early, a big mistake.  It was very challenging to try to soak in the history of the place with so many people snapping photos and bumping into us.  I was also a bit disappointed in the Beefeater tour, which I found short on history, long on stock jokes.  Now that I sound like a big grump, I'll add that the experience of seeing the grafitti carved by prisoners and standing before the final resting place of so many Tudor era victims more than made up for the annoyance of the crowds and predictable jokes. The armor displays were surprisingly good, and once we made it through a packed entrance room and stairway, it was actually possible to see the exhibits.   The line for the crowned jewels looked short at the end of the day, but beware--it snakes around endlessly inside the building (kind of like Space Mountain).  By the time you get to the jewels, you are on a conveyer belt so you can't really examine something that interests you.  The best  part of the Tower for me was attending the Ceremony of the Keys at night.  Write for tickets well in advance (address is on the Tower of London website), and you will be admitted after closing time to watch the ceremony with about 100 other people.   It's eerie to be in the Tower after dark.  We lagged behind the group as we left and at last I had a little time and space to soak it in.  I suspect that morning visitors might have the same opportunity.  The Tower is beautifully lit at night, so even if you don't have tickets to the ceremony, it would be worth it to walk the outer perimeter at night.If you go with children, ask for one of the children's guide books.  It will send you around the grounds and keep the kids interested.When we went, I was able to use a London 2for1 coupon with my single day travelpass to get one free entrance--an amazing deal!.  Check on the London 2 for 1 website to see if a similar deal is in effect when you travel (you need to print out the coupon before you go)"
"May 17, 2020",Historic Fortress of the Tower of London,We joined a tour group led by a guide who injected many humorous remarks along with his version of historical facts. Educational and fun.
"November 10, 2019",Very very nice,There is a lot to see at this location included the Crown jewels. The lines can be really long but they are worth. It is a really interesting place you must visit if you are in London.
"January 14, 2020",Amazing -Top 10 attractions in the world ! ," Where in the world can you go and see so much history in one place ....nowhere.  Whether you are fans if the royals or not there is so much to see here ... just the buildings themselves blow me away.  Yes there are crowds - you can't complain about that but there are crowds everywhere when it comes to worldwide attractions. Top Tip - Purchase and PRINT off your tickets at home. Then get there early ....I was there for 9.30 and one of the first in so it's not super early. The stand out is the Crown Jewels , its great these are on display for the public to see. Also if you can jump on a Beefeater tour these are well worth it. The armoury has to be one of my favourite areas to see. Also the original chapel has some wonderful history.  There is no real options for food and drinks so I take my own and there's no issues with that.  Awesome thing to do in London and top of the list in my guide .⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  "
"July 12, 2005",The Ceremony of keys,"We just returned from London and we went to the Tower to see the Ceremony of Keys.  You have to write ahead of time to get tickets but they are free and well worth it.  You can find the address on their web-site and it is really easy to do.  This was just the most amazing event we went to.  When they tell you the history and you get to see the pomp that goes on it is breath taking.  It is weird to see the soilders with the AK-47's, a bit unnerving.The only thing is that when they say that there are no bathrooms, there are no bathrooms.  When you leave go right to the tube because there are no cabs and you will have to walk a bit if you go anywhere else."
"March 24, 2005",A great history lesson and a must for Brits,"I personally am not bothered by the Royal family, but this tells you your own country's history that they don't bother to teach you in schools. I learnt more about it here than I ever did in school! It really is informative and educational and you get to go around practically the whole thing. It really should be made a compulsory school trip for kids in this country. The best part of it was the crown jewels for me.Just a shame it was ruined by a group of school age tourists that had asbsoultely no respect for others and where they were."
"February 6, 2005",JEWELS,"Extensive museums showing weaponry gets a bit tediuos if you're not into that sort of thing, but the part you can't miss is the Crown Jewels.  Breathtaking.  Very easy to loop back into line to see them again if you want as long as it's not a hugely busy day.  Be sure to walk across Tower Bridge and perhaps visit The HMS Belfast for some great WWII naval history and just enjoy the few from the other side of the Thames."
"November 25, 2021",Gorgeous,Stunning buildings and the crown jewels are gorgeous. I really liked to see the ravens. The exhibitions are well-made and interesting.
"June 30, 2018",Great attraction - very crowded!,"We loved the Tower and the history. However, knowing how crowed it can get ( visited 3 years ago) we got to the location extra early and were among the first people to arrive and bought our tickets in advance on line.  We wanted to be given a tour by one of the Yeoman warders and told to wait until 10 o clock in a designated area. Well by 10 there were over 300 people waiting for the tour to begin. We tried to follow him, but with the large crowd could not hear his presentation. Realize you cannot do anything about the crowds, but would hope the first to arrive would be rewarded by fewer people. "
"April 4, 2017",An amazing attraction steeped in history.,"We had another enjoyable visit to the Tower of London.There is so much history and my favourite part was seeing the Crown Jewels, they are so beautiful and well displayed so you get a good look at them.The ‘Beefeater’ tour was brilliant and the Yeoman Wardens are so friendly, knowledgeable and witty.  They can certainly keep you entertained with their interesting stories.We learned that the Duke of Wellington was Constable of the Tower of London from 1826-1852 and in 1832; he moved the troublesome wild animals out of the Tower of London to Regents Park to join the others in the newly formed Zoological Society of London.  I never knew they kept wild animals in the Tower of London!This attraction is a ‘must see’ when visiting London."
"July 23, 2019",A Must See in London,"Allow at least 3 to 4 hours to properly explore the various towers and learn more about the rich history behind them. It can get very busy, especially on weekends, so try to get a ticket online. I booked through Klook and got an eticket which had to be redeemed at the group tours window before entering. Bear in mind that there is a queue at this window (although it's shorter than the ticket queues), and you will have to wait in another queue for the security check afterwards, before entering the tower. It's advisable to join a Beefeater tour, which is free and starts from 10am every half an hour. The Beefeaters are all very knowledgeable and have the craziest stories to share. Rather wait for the later tours as the first one is always packed. It's also a good idea to view the Crown Jewels exhibition first, as the queue gets ridiculously long during the day, and you really only get about a 20 second viewing period on a platform that moves past the jewels on display."
"June 13, 2019",Tower of London,"Amazing fortress full of history. Prepare to spend at least half a day, so much to see. Very well organized, there were lots of tourists but everything went smoothly. If you are interested in history of Britain, this is a place for you. "
"September 28, 2004",Tower of London - wear athletic shoes!,"Every traveller knows to wear comfortable shoes, but, when visiting the Tower of London, wear athletic shoes, or the thickest, most cushioned pair of shoes you own.  The pavement of the Tower ranges from asphalt to cobblestone, all unforgiving and rife with potential ankle-twisters.  In addition, be prepared to do a substantial amount of going up and down steps.  I wore a pair of rubber-soled SAS loafers, normally very comfortable, but after two hours, I was in serious discomfort.  By the time we left, I was sure I would be crippled!  So, wear those thick-soled sneakers with pride and comfort and enjoy every step."
"January 21, 2006",A must see,"If you have one day in London you must see the Tower of London and Westminster Abbey.The Tower is stepped in history.  A fragment of Roman ruins, the White Tower, the various captives - Elizabeth I, Saints Moore and Fisher, Walter Raliegh, the Princes in the Tower, Kings and nobles of Wales, Scotland and France, the chopping block, the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula and St John the Evangelist (this is in the White Tower), the Crown Jewels, the Fusiliers Museum, the Guards (check out the Ceremony of the Keys), theRavens and of course the Yeomen of the Guards and their entertaining tours.  I rather liked the mock up of how they think the Medieval Palace would be during the reign of Edward I.  Easily a 1/2 day if not the whole day."
"March 20, 2019",Extremely Disappointed,"I had scheduled this tour 3 months in advance. 2 months before our actual tour, we had a change in our schedule that prevented us from taking this your, so I tried to reschedule to a different day. I know it says no refunds, no schedule changes, but I would have thought that given 2 months to make a change, they would accommodate this request to lets us RESCHEDULE to a different day. Instead they refused !!! Only saying there would be no refund, no ability to even communicate with anyone but the person on the phone. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I WILL NEVER BOOK with VIATOR AGAIN."
"January 18, 2019",Amazing to see ,"Really interesting, great couple hrs and a good history lesson. The jewels are amazing. It was a walk from start tonfi ishikawa but nothing heavy"
"May 8, 2008",Take a tour with the beefeaters!,"The Tower of London was a fun stop on our trip. Take a free, guided tour with one of the Beefeaters - the crowds are pretty big in the afternoon, so try to go in the morning on if you can. Our guide was hilarious and informative."
"October 7, 2006",Worth the visit,"A definite must see if visiting London to enhance the London feel.  The history here is what makes it great - even if it is a little pricey:  15 GBP/adult, 12 GBP/senior.  We took the advice of other posters and got there at the opening.  Since we purchased our ticket in advance from the Big Bus Tour people (located at all Big Bus Tour stops), we did not have to buy it at the Tower (although at the time we arrived - Friday at 9am, there were no line ups anyway).  You can buy tickets in advance at your hotel concierge, or any info booth at the train stations as well as at the Tower.   You can also buy them online if you prefer.  Anyway, once you get there, go immediately to the Jewels and get that out of the way.  There were only 2 other people in the room (and 2 Tower employees) when we got there and therefore we made a couple of trips around the room (there is an automated walkway that takes you along the jewels, but when you get off, you can just walk back to the beginning and do it again.  We had to ask where the Koh-i-noor diamond was - as we were looking at the top of the crown, not on the front of it - so keep your eyes open or ask questions.  After we did the Jewel Tower, we went back to the entrance gate and picked up a Warder tour - a definite must do as you'll get much more out of the visit.  They have quite a dry sense of humor and oh - don't forget to ask them first if you can have your picture taken with them, as I saw one poor woman harrassed by the Warder when she just stood beside him to have her picture taken!!!  They are very agreeable if you ask.  After the Warder tour, you may want to walk through the White Tower and have your own look around.  To get the most out of your day, you may want to also include a trip up to Tower Bridge 5.5 GBP/adjust, 4.5 GBP/senior (a must do for the views alone), and you could stop for a pub lunch or a pint at the Dicken's Inn on St. Katherine's Docks.  Oh - be prepared to pay anywhere from 2 GBP to 3.3 GBP for a pint (it seems to vary all over London).  If you look at the US dollar as equivalent to the British Pound you won't flinch too much at the prices.  Everything is about double what it is here!!!  Sorry I'm getting long winded on this post, but if you have ventured to the Tower, and you want to get a ride on an original Routemaster bus (the type you get on from the back), you can do so at Tower Hill bus stop in front of the tower, and take it back to Trafalgar Square - bus #15.  The Routemaster will be gone for good in 2010 since it is not handicap accessible.  The busroute is known as the Heritage route.  There are 2 routes left with these buses #9 and #15.  The #15 Heritage route goes from Trafalgar Square to Tower Hill (both directions).  If you are there for a week - get a 7 day TravelCard which includes tubes/buses and gives you a discount on Thames River cruises."
"April 28, 2006",Tower of London great!,"My family visited over Christmas 2003 and it was our first time to London except for my dad.  I thought this place was the most interesting thing we saw in that city.  I am not a history buff by any means but this really captivated me.  The place was awsome, and when you are aware of the history of the Tower, it makes it sooooo interesting.  My favorite places were the crown jewels and the display where the battle armor was.  Even the horse's armor was on display and that was very amazing.  We did not take a tour, just strolled around on our own.  I would recommend a tour and next year when I go again, I would go and do one of the Beefeeter escorted tours.  The waiting in line was rough.  It was super cold that day and their computers broke down.  We probably waited 2hrs in line to get in.  Next time I will by tickets prior so there is no wait.  You just jump the line and go on in.  We didn't know that then, but it really is a time saver!  You can buy tickets on line and my friend told me about ----.  Check it out."
"February 19, 2006",Get there early!,"It is quite a few years since I last visited the Tower of London and I must say it has changed a lot - only for the better!  The Jewel House is extremely well-laid-out and all the displays in the White Tower are well organised and signed.  Staff were very friendly and willing to explain and answer our questions.The new restaurant does good food at reasonable prices too !I would certainly say you havent visited London if you havent been to the Tower, but get there early to avoid the coach parties and the queues. Its worth every penny!!"
"June 24, 2006","Tower of London- pretty much required, but....","The Tower of London is fine: you get to see the crown jewels, lots of weapons, some prison cells, a nice view of the Thames.  If you're coming to London for the first time, it is pretty much a required stop on the standard tourist trail.However, I would not be nearly as sanguine if you could only visit during prime visiting hours, i.e. if you have to fight massive crowds of tourists and visiting schoolkids.  Frankly, I'd skip it if I had to wade through the masses.I strongly suggest: buy your ticket in advance (in the underground station at tower hill, or at your hotel).  Tickets are 15 pounds for an adult.  Take the tube and arrive at the Tower Hill station at 9:30.  You'll be in the T of L by 9:40.  Go straight to the Jewels (since that's where the crowds tend to congregate quickly) and enter.  You'll pretty much have the place to yourself, like we did.  Then go to the White Tower and get through that.If you're inclined, go back to the traitors gate (near the entrance) and hook up with a tour led by the Yeoman Warders.  If you like to go at your own pace, skip the YW tour, spend 3 pounds, and take yourself on a self-guided audio tour.We spent about two hours total.  I guess you might be able to stretch it into 3 if you want, especially if you buy lunch but by then the crowds will be unpleasantly enormous."
"June 21, 2006",Want to walk around bored out of your mind? Visit the Tower of London,"Despite the many glowing reviews, we were disappointed with the Tower of London. It is not that big or interesting, and how many old weapons do you really want to see? It is so touristy that it has a Disney world feel.  I did not feel close to history at all.The crown jewels did not interest me; I doubt they would be of interest to most men. Women might enjoy seeing them. I found them gaudy and garish and not worth the wait.Here's a tip: if you must go, go later in the afternoon.  It's still crowded, but not nearly as busy as earlier in the day. Avoid the overpriced gift shops selling items made outside of England. I would never go here again nor would I take first timers to London here. Point it out from a distance; save your money."
"October 29, 2005",Lots of History,"We really enjoyed the Tower of London.  Wait for the free guided tour by the beefeaters, even if it means you are part of a big crowd.  They are entertaining and point out things to look for inside.  The jewels were fabulous, though clearly there can sometimes be a long wait for them, and I don't know if they would have been fabulous if I had had to wait through all the queues they had.  We were pretty much able to walk right to them and stay as long as we liked.  They were pretty unbelievable.  Outside of that, there were lots of rooms to explore and displays to see, a lot of history to be had.  An overall very interesting experience."
"June 24, 2005",The Tower in 2 hours,"The Tower is a must see for anyone who has interest in English History.  That being said, I strongly recommend reading up a little on your English History before touring the Tower.  This will provide you a much greater appreciation of what you are viewing.  There is a lot here to behold, take your time and begin your tour in the early morning, if possible. When my family recently toured here, we had already had a long day of touring Westminster and Whitehall, so our feet were tired and, after having seen the glory of the previous 2 sites, we were left a little unimpressed by these older, less ornate buildings."
"September 16, 2019",Steeped in History,"My wife and I visited the Tower of London recently and were extremely pleased we did so. We spent the best part of six hours walking around a fascinating piece of history. The Yeomen of the guard conduct amazing tours that both educate and entertain, and are more than happy to have their photo taken with you. The spectacular buildings with the walls are a testament to the genius of the builders of the past."
"November 18, 2019",Beautiful,Haven't got a chance to do a tour. Visited for a night view multiple times and the scenea are just amazing.
"May 1, 2019",A stand out icon,Whilst enjoying a walk along the Thames you can’t but help to notice the Tower of London standing out on the opposite bank.
"July 27, 2018","Wonderful Tour, so much to see.","Absolutely worth visiting. So much to see, including a live Presentation of the Beheading of Anne Boleyn.The Crown Jewels were unbelieveable, so much Gold, so opulent.Allow at least 3-4 hours for a leisurely visit. We went in JULY 2018, their Summer, it was a record heat of 30-32 degrees. "
"May 15, 2018",Wow; just wow...,"Spike was our Beefeater guide in this place of incredible history, and he was amazing. I've visited the Tower of London before, without a guide, and missed out on the key details of this amazing place. The incredible violence and intrigue that went on here rivals any spot in the world, and getting the history live as you walk through is an unparalleled experience. Make sure you also check out Mint Street and the coin exhibit, and of course, the Crown Jewels (check out the punch bowl and ladle) and a trip up the Tower. Not to be missed. "
"August 17, 2017",Good - not great,"The Tower of London is worth a visit, but don't expect to be blown away.  It is good; not great.  Plan accordingly."
"June 12, 2017",Bizarre experience -- very unfriendly staff,"I am an American tourist and artist.  Visited the Tower today and had a bizarre experience with a very unfriendly staffer. I was standing in the little park area near the river painting a view of the Tower when a woman named Dipa Bhatt came out and told me that artists are not allowed in the vicinity of the Tower. At first she said I was blocking the road (which I wasn't), but when I asked if there was a better place she said no, artists are not allowed anywhere in the vicinity. I've called around London and there are no specific ordinances or laws against painting outdoors so have no idea what this was about. I've visited London often and never had a bad experience or encountered anyone at the attractions who were unfriendly."
"July 28, 2016","Overcrowded in summer, best time in winter !","I visted London and Great Britain the first time in the 1970ies when I was a youngstudent at a school in Germany. I enjoyed to vist many interesting places in London, and I recommend you to vist the Tower of London! It is really worth to  visit it.I enjoyed to travel all over London and all over GB. That was not my first and only visit, but I have travelled several times to London and to U.K. in the last 40 years!I'm a fan of this phantastic city of London!"
"October 27, 2014",Overcrowded and overrated,"Given it's widespread fame, history and World Heritage status the tower of london usually falls generically on many tourists' london 'to do lists', myself included. I visited with my partner on Monday the 27th of October 2014. Given largely positive reviews through word of mouth and tripadvisor (which places it as number 47 of 1033 things to do in london) we had high expectations of the day but were grossly disappointed with this probably being the worst thing we have done in our 4 weeks in England.The most dominant issue is that the tower was far too overcrowded and highly unregulated. This is a combination of it's long term status as a tourist hotspot but I would also speculate that there may be a spike in local tourism numbers due to the 888 thousand odd red poppies which are currently being placed around the tower to commemorate the deaths of British and colonial troops in WW1.  In addition and unknowingly to me this week is autumn school holidays. The result? Madness! Getting to the tower at opening representing a scene similar to a stadium post football match with thousands gathering around just to photograph the poppies. Once we waded through there was a 35 minute wait for tickets, followed by a 25minute wait to get into the entrance. Booking online can secure you fast-tracked entry and 1 pounds off pricing but unless you physically have the tickets you have to line up at another register to get them, which had a queue just as long. Once inside the lines continued with a 25 minute wait for the white tower and a 30 minute wait for the torture tower. Overall we spent 5 hours here of which 2 hours was spent in queues. We didn't end up seeing the crown jewels as the queue spanned easily around 250m (snaked around the castle) and would've taken 2 hours as it moved very slowly. Despite the increasingly busy crowds there is limited representative of staff who don't regulate the often perplexing queue lines which snaked around in a disorganized fashion. As a result numerous frustrated/rude tourists make their best efforts to exploit polite English manner and skipped in successfully which further fueled my frustration.The attractions internally seem a little underwhelming to my eyes, although this may be reflective of my previous visits to other England castles such as Leeds Castle, Arundel and Bodiam which all far and away were much nicer and better presented, not to mention had 10% the number of tourists. The displays present weren't able to be fully appreciated as crowds poured through unregulated in number (except in white tower), often with children jumping on the exhibits. They also seemed to be more targeted towards children which is probably in fitting with the theme park environment that appeared to have been created.The price for adults was 22 pounds at the door or 21 pounds online, although this includes a 'donation' which you can easily opt out of, which brings the price down to 20 pounds or 19 pounds respectively. Children are half this price and seniors/full time student/disabled get a small reduction in price. Is it expensive? Yes, but hey that's England.Overall, I found this whole day to be exceptionally frustrating. This was largely a reflection of the crowds and resultant queues and inability to appreciate the castle and it's displays but reading through TA it seems like this is a recent exacerbation of long term pre-existing overcrowding. Would I recommend it to others? Not off today's experience. My only hope is that this is largely because of the crowds. If you did choose to come I would definitely recommend booking online in advance and arriving just as the castle opens. Once it opens I would go to the crown jewels to avoid inevitable queues, followed by the torture tower and white tower before viewing the rest of the attraction. Personally, I wouldn't be back and I won't be recommending it to others."
"April 28, 2011",very interesting - go for a guided tour!,"we went to Tower of London on Easter Friday - appearently the busiest day of the year but it wasn't as crowded as we'd expected.The yeoman (beefeater) guide had a great sense of humor and told a lot of fascinating tales of the Tower of London - not only dry facts - so I really recommend the 1 hour guided tour both to kids and adults.We followed the guided tour at 10 o'clock which was the first of the day and I think that was wise as the place just got more and more busy. We went straight for the crown jewels after that and didn't even stand in line for 5 minutes before we were let in - however 1 hour later it was very busy (so I recommend that you go there as early in the day as possible).You can buy food and drink on the premises but there are also several cafees + KFC just outside the entrance where you can buy take-away for the little park across the street or the path along the river Thames. TIP: you can also cross Tower bridge, turn right and find a great pub just 5-10 minutes along the Thames: they serve both drinks and meals and have inside + outside seating.When you visit Tower of London you are just steps away from Tower Bridge. It's also fascinating and worth a stroll (if your legs aren't too tired)..."
"January 4, 2009",Really disappointed!,"I was really disappointed with my trip to the Tower of London. I brough my australian relatives along and told them it would be worth the money. As we arrived we took our photograph with a beefeater and a giant teddy bear at the gift shop. We queued up for the 'bloody tower' for an hour and when we entered, saw plastic versions of how they used to punish people in the tower. We went down one staircase to see this, and then back up and we were straight back outside. What a waste of time! We even went back to see if there was anything else because it was just impossible! But, we thought, at least there are still the crown jewels. The queue was 2 and a half hours long, and we didn't have time, so we couldn't go there (that's obviously not the tower's fault, just a shame!) Then we went in some other tower (not sure on the name) and we kept going round and round the staircases until we were quite high up and saw some plastic horses, a suit of armor and a couple of axes and then we had to go down and down and round and round the same staircases. We wandered around for ages after this looking for something interesting to see. We saw some little water gate thing, the ravens and that was about it. Then it shut and we had to leave! I don't know if it is just that we missed the main attractions when we wandering around or what. But it certainly wasn't worth spending my money on!"
"December 14, 2018",History made alive...,"I absolutely LOVED visiting the Tower of  London.  Spent an entire day there. Had the fast track ticket - and were there very early- otherwise prepare yourself for hours in the ticket queue and way too large tours.  Loved the Beefeater tours and were very surprised to learn that they were actually high ranking soldiers in the army and went through rigorous selection to become Beefeaters.  Many of them apparently from the same bloodlines as the original Yeoman Warders. I loved the actors playing out the history - and even had to vote to ""spare the life"" of one of Anne Boleyn's lovers!  The Crown Jewels... well, if there wasn't a ""conveyor belt"" in front of the crowns - I may have stood there in awe for way too long.  It is a very clever idea to have a conveyor belt - otherwise the crowds would most certainly not have been able to move.  The blood tower was an eerie place with a tragic history. If you listen well -  the prison still rings with the cries of tortured souls - and the walls speak of last thoughts and the knowledge of impending death often by the cruellest manners.  The Tower of London has a bloody history and the earth beneath her is soaked with the blood of many a soul - more often the blood of the innocent.  Ah, the Ravens!  Love the tradition of keeping the crows + one, for in case the tower falls (although I never enjoy animals/birds kept in cages). Wild beasts were - and still are kept at the whim and for the entertainment of powerful people - and the Tower sure had it's share.  The lonely polar bear living it's life chained... in stone... an unspeakable tragedy.  Cannot even imagine a beast so free living this horrible imprisoned life...  Visiting The Chapel Royal of St Peter ad Vindula is a privilege and the lecture inside - surrounded by the graves - a look into the yesterday of many souls... long, long ago. The Fusillier Museum was interesting - but being a South African and knowing the history of my country - and the Anglo-Boer war where 26,000.00 woman and children starved to death, were raped by the English soldiers, and died of illness and exposure to sub-zero temperatures were not even mentioned. Nor were the fact that a ""scorched earth"" policy meant that every Farm was burnt to the ground and all animals killed, and crops burnt - as they could not beat the ""Boer"" commandos with their Guerrilla warfare. Old men, little boys, in fact all males were soldiers - and the woman were left to look after the farms. When this proved a thorn in the side of the English - as they were bleeding money and more and more soldiers had to be shipped to South Africa - because they could not win in the conventional manner - they employed the hideous way of Nazi concentration camps to break the spirit of the young nation.  Men were sent to islands like Ceylon in exile... and the aftermath of this war, made for a lot of bad blood between our nation and the Brits. The old people - many now dead - still spoke of the horrors of the camps and many had lost up to 13 children in the camps... The fact that the Boer war is actually just mentioned - almost in passing... is not - to my mind fair play.  But, with that said - I still loved the Tower!"
"September 3, 2018",Good if the tours were better managed,"Lovely visit, we went early to avoid the crowds and literally had to wait 5 mins to see the Crown Jewels at 10.45 am.  I would have liked to have gone on a beefeater tour but every tour we looked at between 10.30 am and 12.30 midday was absolutely heaving and looked quite unbearable due to the crowds.  I think they need to look at this and perhaps offer tours every 15 mins/booking system or more guides.  It is expensive to enter so disappointed that we couldn't take up on the tours especially as you can't go in the chapel without being on a tour.  Tip, when you come out of the Tower turn left and walk for approx. 250 yds along the river and you come to St Katherine's Docks where Glorianna (Queens Golden Jubilee) boat is moored - nice to see."
"September 3, 2018",Lovely attraction but lots of stairs,"We visited the Tower last week, Obviously a fabulous building, was great to look round the fast track tickets got us straight in so no need to queue and the staff were helpful on the way in. Once in there are plenty of signposts but there are also a lot of stairs, we could not find any lifts or anyone nearby to ask. The queue was long for the crown jewels so as I cant stand for that long we didn't go in the jewel tower. So anyone with physical impairments just be warned. Other than that its well worth a visit."
"July 29, 2018","Yeomen Warders/""Beefeaters"" Misogynist and Ableist A-Holes","I took my disabled father to the Tower of London, a place he had always wanted to visit. The staff at the entrance couldn't have been more kind or accommodating, giving us a map of accessible entrances and paths. When we entered the tower, however, we had a number of terrible encounters with the Yeomen/""Beefeaters"" who were intentionally rude to both me and my father who was in a wheelchair. At one point, I was confused about how to enable my father's entry into the chapel and attempted to walk down an open path to investigate whether or not there was a ramp. At this point, a Yeoman Warder physically came up and shoved me asking me ""where do you think you're going?"" Shocked (and rattled at having my personal space so suddenly and violently invaded), I explained the situation and he was incredibly rude in response telling me that no one was allowed into the chapel. A few moments later, he gestured to a horde of people to enter but wouldn't let us. My father and I both felt humiliated. From what I can gather, Yeomen are bullies who enjoy dressing up and abusing their modicum of artificial power in whatever small ways they can get away with. Disgusting."
"July 23, 2018",Rude beefeater ruined our visit,"We visited Tower of London together with guests from overseas. In our group there were 3 adults and 3 teenagers. We speak good English and live in UK for long, guests speak some English.We were in need of the toilet, actually one of our guest was. After waiting in the queue to attraction, checking in and passing bag search we landed in a crowded place.My husband asked one of beefeaters that was standing just next to us 'Excuse me, where the nearest toilet is, please?'. THE BEEFEATER didn't hear him. There was a crowd around us, it was very loud. So my husband asked louder again. No reaction. After few times, THE BEEFEATER turned to us and said or rather shouted to my husband that this place is his home and my husband has no manners, that my husband has to say 'excuse me and please' and that in THIS COUNTRY you need manners! We were in shock. Crowd around us stopped and looked at the 'scene' too. THE BEEFEATER asked my husband if he wants to leave right now or is he going to behave better. He even stopped one staff member for help, maybe to have a witness? What a ridiculous incidents.I tried to calm down THE BEEFEATER asking what we can do to calm the situation down. My husband wasn't going to apologise - he did not do anything wrong. We just entered 'the tourist attraction'... Maybe this is the hot weather in London and thick clothing that make poor BEEFEATERS tired of guests? Anyway this one person ruined our experience for the rest of time in Tower of London. Our guest plus teenagers couldn't just believe in what happened. It doesn't matter now the history which is exposed in Tower of London. For me THE CULTURE of this one person was everything I experienced in Tower of London. My second thought was that THE BEEFEATER felt offended by answering a question about the toilet location. Sorry, there was no instructions on Tower entrance of what you can speak to BEEFEATER about."
"July 8, 2018",Essential to Visit (of course),"We spent 5 hours touring the Tower, and did not even get to the Crown Jewels tour -- it was fascinating.  The staff is knowledgeable and very interested in helping visitors by providing historical context -- but they are not intrusive, and offer information only when asked.  Our teenage son never tired of the experience, but I would advise against bringing young children, who might quickly become weary of the time spent there.  To avoid long lines (and they form rapidly!) buy your tickets in advance (online) and arrive at 9:30am for the first entry at 10 o'clock."
"June 22, 2018",Top 5 place to see in London,"Fantastic tour (do the Beefeater led tour once you are inside....no extra cost & totally worth it)!  Crown jewels, huge ravens that live in the courtyard, awesome facts & info given by the Beefeater.....this place is a MUST see."
"March 19, 2018","Great trip with a fun, engaging guide",We visited on a cold day but the tour guide was lively and fun. He told fantastic stories and made the tour really engaging. 
"February 27, 2018",Great day out,"Pre booked tickets online but still had to queue to redeem voucher but it wasn't a long wait. Went on a yeoman warder tour , very informative and funny. Crown Jewels exhibit was a bit rushed as it was on a travelator, to stop people staying too long. Very clean everywhere ( including toilets) souvenirs a bit pricey as was the food available."
"October 31, 2016",send them to the tower!,"Yes, you should definitely go to the tower.It's full of things to see. Crown jewels are the best, but it's just a start. Take guided tower and you'll find so many fun facts about the tower. Great place for family vacation."
"August 25, 2019",must visit for all Indians,"I believe that if an Indian wishes to see how much the British exploited Indians and how much money they took from our land to eradicate their hunger and poverty, then the tower of London is the place to be. SEE the diamonds the rubies and all precious items they stole from India to satisfy their impoverished needs."
"July 31, 2019","""Skip the Lines"" - NOT!!!","Want to pay MORE and then be told to get in line with everyone else who paid less? Then, THIS is the tour for you!What a rip off! I should have just gone up to the ticket window and bought my tickets outright. It would have saved me money, and I still would have had to wait in all the normal lines."
"July 21, 2019",Very beautiful Place,"The Tower of London is a must see, but if you come in the touristy season, plan to be there as soon as it opens to avoid massive crowds. We came around 10:20 and the crowds weren’t bad at all, but when we were done the crowds were big. It’s a very beautiful place with lots of history. I’m glad we got to see it."
"July 12, 2019","Go early esp if it’s summer. Kids 10, 13 and 15","This is a must see. Of all the sites we crammed into our short 2 night stay in London this topped the list.London Tower is not only picturesque (Palace, on the Thames, with prisons, next to Tower Bridge) but fascinating (Jane Grey imprisoned and executed here, you can see her graffiti on the wall) historical (more monarchs lived here in this palace than any other), and the Beefeater experience only adds to it. Crown Jewels at a must do and kids rode the moving walkway twice to get a view of jewels from either side. Go early. Ticket line is short but entry line long. We arrived at 10am first entry with online tix bought, but the entry line already snaked along two sides of the Palace. Line moved quickly and we were in under 30 min. Go immediately to Crown Jewels line skipping beefeater tour and all other sites. The Crown Jewels line only gets longer throughout the day.  Our wait at 10:35 was 5 minutes to get in. When we exited 30 minutes later the line was 10x longer. "
"July 2, 2019",Overcrowded and misleading info ,I came here 25 years ago and it was the highlight of my trip... I was a bit disappointed this go round. I was led to believe this was a fast pass or skip the line which it is not. The beefeater tour had over 100 people swarming the beefeater so it was quite disappointing. The line for the crown jewels was so long we didn’t go because we had already lined up forever to get in to the place. 
"June 28, 2019",Majestic Tower of London - One of the best things to do in London,"Tower of London is one of the most recognisable icons of London often shown in the same image as the adjacent Tower Bridge.It offers a magnificent view from across the river Thames, from Tower Bridge and a sense of well preserved history as you get closer even before you explore it from the inside.Wonderful visual treat for visitors and locals."
"June 20, 2019",GREAT!,"We went on a weekday around 11 am, and there was no line! Make sure to meet up with a Beefeater (guy/lady in red uniform) to the left of the entrance for a free tour! It was super informative and entertaining! Give yourself a few hours for sure to see all the Tower has to offer, including the ravens. We just watched them for at least 30 minutes. So much history! The Crown Jewels line looked lengthy, but moved very quickly, so don't let the line deter you. These are THE crown jewels, so YES, wait in the line. :) Also, the view of Tower Bridge is great. Even if you only have a short time in London, make SURE to include The Tower of London."
"June 17, 2019","Be sure to use the Yeoman Warder ""Beefeater"" Tour available at no extra cost","While I generally enjoy taking guided/walking tours, after ten very dry ones in Britain, I was burned out.  Glad I opted to take the “Beefeater Tour"" on my visit to the Tower of London; my final tourist stop.   Yeoman warder, Scott Kelly, the 409th yeoman warder of all time, was our entertaining guide.  The current 37 yeoman warders all live and work in the Tower of London.  It’s a ""massive honor"" to become one. You need to have completed at least 22 years of military service, earned a Good Conduct Medal,  and attained a rank of warrant officer.  Scott's humor kept our attention.  I'm very hard of hearing and although our group was large, I was always able to position myself where I could hear Scott.  It helped he had a voice that carried and was mindful to speak loudly so all could hear.  Good tour.  Fun."
"June 16, 2019",Vacation! ,"I have been wanting to see the Tower for ages, and I was not disappointed! Once you are on the grounds, make sure to take the guided tour with the Yeoman Warder.  Our guide was Jim, and he was incredible.  I would strongly recommend giving yourself lots of time, as there is so much to see.  The Crown Jewels and the ravens were my favourite! "
"June 15, 2019",A must for anyone with an interest in English history,"While the Tower of London is a must on the list of any person with an interest in English history, and while the site as such is impressing and worth a visit, just as the displays are well made, something is lacking: character. An example: One of the more interesting parts of the history of the Tower is that of the Royal Mint. The exhibit does not reflect that: it is small, and uninspiring, which means it is too small and cursory to satisfy anyone already interested in the topic, and not tempting anyone who isn't already read on the topic to learn more.A recreation of the mint works during, say, sir Isaac Newton's tenure would had been one way to make it better.The same could be said about the White Tower. Displays of armour is all well but a recreation of the interior from one or two of the more interesting periods had better tickled my fantasy.It was worth visiting, but I'm not expecting to return."
"June 3, 2019",Scott Kelly Beefeater is awesome,"Dramatic presentation, good humor and he brings history to life! Wish the tour was longer. So many beheadings, so many queens wronged. So many outspoken people tortured. "
"May 30, 2019",National embarrassment,"Today we experienced a very underwhelming visit to the Tower.  This should be an iconic landmark. The Tower is very significant in British history and let's face it, not many museums have world-famous crown jewels to work with. Because we visited with someone who has life membership of English Heritage, we did not have to pay. Fortunately. If I had wasted the amount of time on queues to buy tickets, get onto the site, get in to the crown jewels, follow the crowds to see the jewels etc etc. and then paid more than £70 for the privilege, (two adults and a child), I'd struggle to be polite!  There are lots of characters in costume, but frankly, most add little except cost.  There is an absence of engaging displays for children (Beasts of the Tower looks very tired and limited), and little guidance is provided to parents on which parts of the Tower experience might suit different age groups. The whole site feels tremendously inefficient, lacks investment in meaningful visitor experience and fails miserably at bringing history or the significance of the jewels alive (there are so many ways this could be done especially given the money collected!).  This could be an experience which really entices international visitors to visit more and explore more of the history of England.   Instead, I'm amazed that more visitors don't complain about time and money that could have been better spent!"
"May 30, 2019",I cancelled and was given no refund,When you search online it has the heading Tower Of London Tickets | Cancel 24H Prior & Full Refund    but if you read the fine print it says no refund is given.   This is false advertising     horrible customer experience.   shame on trip advisor.
"May 9, 2019","Fascinating, a must see","Don't be scared off by the  idea of a long que. The Tower and the Crown Jewels are absolutely a must see in London. Purchase a ticket voucher online in advance, then you just go to the group ticket window and redeem the voucher for your tickets. Very quick. Do go early in the day and see the Crown Jewels first. The que gets longer as the day progresses. The Crown Jewels are amazing, and someone had the brilliant idea of a moving floor that carries people past them so the line keeps moving. But not to worry, you can go back and pass by them again, or you can move up to the overlooking stationary platform and look longer. The history of the tower is amazing. Don't miss the tiny, tiny staircase up to the ""Bloody Tower"" where the little princes were imprisoned. You can spend 2 hours, or and entire morning. It is fabulous."
"February 26, 2019",Beefeater Tour ,"Seeing the Tower of London with a Beefeater Tour was an excellent way to view this historic property. This requires pre-booking which I did online prior to coming to England. It was pretty thrilling to see the Crown Jewels, unsettling to view the execution place of Anne Boleyn and then the chapel where she was buried. Walking up the winding tower stairs to where various prisoners were kept - some who never made it out alive - was eerie as many had carved their names into the stone walls. Definitely an important place to see and experience while in London!"
"January 28, 2019",DISABLED - DON'T GO to Tower of London . DISGRACEFUL accessibility !,"As a Londoner I am ashamed that London's most historically significant building is mainly restricted to the able-bodied ! I came here with my 6 year old son who is in a wheelchair. We paid a whopping £14 child ticket only to find out that only 10% of the buildings can be accessed by a wheelchair. Guess they don't want to spend the money !. Lots of excuses about no lifts in a historic buildings etc. Red herring - decent ramps are simple and easy to install. Come on Historic Royal Palaces, do the right thing and create a building that doesn't DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE DISABLED !"
"January 16, 2019",Amazing visit,"Must see when in London. As i remember entrance was about 30 Us Dollars(and it worth every penny). and it will take you like 3 hours to finish this tour.. consider visiting the tours bridge, belfast (the ship, and u can finish eating at the borough market.  "
"January 15, 2019",Our guide Laurence was fantastic ,"Myself and my partner decided to go to the Tower of London because we were doing a bus tour of the city and felt it was something we should do. It was a bitterly cold , miserable day but our guide Laurence was just brilliant so we barely noticed that we were frozen solid ! He had a wonderful way of telling the history  to us & as horrific as the stories were he made them enjoyable constantly interacting with the crowd and especially involving the kids , I would think there was around 200 people in our group but his booming voice and wonderful attitude meant that nobody missed out on what he was saying ."
"November 12, 2018",sound and light show commemorating WW1,"During the week of Nov.3-10, 2018 the Tower of London was the site for an amazing event commemorating WW1. The combination of light, fog (technical and real), sound, voice and movement was brilliantly presented. The weather with its torrents of rain set a scene of trenches and misery. 45,000+ people watched for about 45 minutes, all in silence. One heart remembering the horror and sacrifice. We will always be thankful for those who served and fought for freedom. May we never forget and always work to find solutions other than war."
"November 10, 2018",Wonderful visit,"The Tower if London is fascinating. It is amazing that it is still active. We could not get to see the the Crown Jewels on Saturday, the lines were just too long. Since we had a London Pass, we went back on Monday and walked right in! They are beautiful and with the second trip."
"June 12, 2017",By all means PRINT your tickets before arriving!,If you purchase tickets on line before your visit (and there is a substantial discount to do so) by all means PRINT the tickets before you arrive. The web site says you can go to the group tickets window to pick up your prepaid tickets. We are waiting in a crazily long queue on a Monday morning. If I had known this I would have paid full price for tickets on site (much shorter queue). Now we'll never get to see the Crown Jewels. So disappointed in the pre-purchase ticket pickup process at the Tower of London!
"May 6, 2017",Incredible - Must do the Beefeater tour,"We got to the Tower before opening time so were among the first to go in which was great because we were able to go through the Crown Jewels display with hardly anyone else in there before heading back out to the first Beefeater tour.  There were so many people waiting (i'm guessing nearly 100) for the tour that we nearly decided to wait until a later one, but once the guide started he kept the whole crowd entertained, and involved.  It was fanastic how he well he presented the tour.  He was also very funny especially considering the grim and gruesome content of his talk.  I would definitely say this is an absolute must when coming to London. After the tour, we went through the White Tower which was really interesting and then explored the other sections. We used the National Rail 2for1 voucher here as well"
"April 24, 2017",One of our best days in London!,"This was a must-see.  Be sure the see the jewels, the line looks long but it goes fairly quickly.  Buying line hopping passes ahead doesn't save much time at this venue"
"February 10, 2017",Immerse yourself in history,"Be prepared for line ups...long line ups to get in because of bag checks. Line goes quickly though. Get there when it opens in the morning. First thing to do is get a map and go immediately to the crown jewels. If you wait for the tour, there will be a line up about a mile long to see the same jewels. SEE THE JEWELS FIRST! Then, you can go back to the moat for the crowded beefeater tour which is included in your ticket price. Very entertaining and informative with some humour thrown in for good measure. He will point out buildings, but will not go into them. Go after the tour. You can also get audio guides for a fee and skip the tour, but only get the guides AFTER you see the jewels. The jewels are pretty spectacular, and the bonus is that if you get there early, you can see them alone and go through as quickly or as long as you like, otherwise uou'll be snaking along in there like a snail; I kid you not.  As the day goes on, it will get really busy. You might want to go into the white Tower right after the jewels as there are line ups too, but no where near as long as for the jewels. The tower has armour. You can see a couple of armour suits from King Henry  XVIII; one was for a slim man in his 20s, the other was fitted for an obese man in his 40s. Quite a difference from his youth and the result of a severe jousting injury to his leg which resulted in a sedentary and very painful lifestyle for the unfortunate king. There are also cannon, guns, swords, pikes, horses armour and much more. There are also a few videos inside for you to enjoy.In the prisoner rooms, you will see the names of famous condemned people who scratched their names, initials or sayings in the stone. One of them was the young, 16 year old, princess Elizabeth who luckily was later released and became England's greatest queen.Outside, there is the place where the wretched Anne Boleyn met her death on the block by a French executioners sword by order of her husband. This is also the place where the teenage Lady Jane Grey, queen for just 9 days and beaten and forced to marry against her will was also beheaded by Mary I whose army overwhelmed the tower. There are many gift shops throughout the tower with different price ranges. You will also be surprised to find the eremains of the former zoo, once full of exotic animals who were gifted to various royals and who met their untimely demise in the dank London air and atmoshere.Throughout your visit, there are theatrical plays going on that encourage audirpence participation. Don't expect to be sitting down either as you will be moving around with the costumed actors from one place to another. It was quite entertaining! The one I saw told the story of William the Conqueror of znormandy, France and Harold I of England. The audience had to take sides on who they thought should be king, then plan their attack. Great fun for all ages, and lots of comic relief there too! You can see this in pictures of this story if you go to Bayeux, France to see the 1000 year old Bayeux Tapestry. The visit to the whole Tower complex easily takes 3 hours or more, and don't rush through as you can learn a lot. It is a must see important site of British history. Note, that there are cobblestones and narrow stairs everywhere. Not good for wheelchairs or strollers, but I did see both. "
"August 20, 2016","Awesome, full of history!","So much has already been written about the Tower of London, so I'll keep it short.1. Buy tickets online to skip the line. Also, see the Crown Jewels first as the line grows throughout the day.2. Set aside 3-4 hours if you want to see everything.3. Go on a tour. The beefeaters are friendly, funny, and charismatic. "
"July 26, 2016",Get a tour with the Beefeaters and you will love every minute of it!,"We had a great weather to visit this fabulous structure and while the ticket price is steep in my opinion (25 pounds for an adult!) thanks to to free tour with one of the Beefeaters it was all worth it!. We learned a lot of the gruesome history, the intrigues, the murders, while being entertain at the same time. The Crown Jewels were beautiful and we spend quite a bit of time just walking the walls and imagine the times of the Kings and Queens that inhabited this palace so long ago! Go in the afternoon, there is so much less people and you won't have to queue to go and see the Crown Jewels."
"June 26, 2016",Amazing place full of history and great stories.,"This was our first visit to the Tower and we absolutely loved it! I researched for helpful tips for visiting and found some, which indeed made our trip here nice and fairly easy:- Choose the lesser evil: visiting during weekdays there's usually lots of student groups but then again on Saturday and Sunday there's bigger chance for large masses of people.- GO EARLY. Check the opening times and go there as soon as the place opens. If you want to see the crown jewels, DO THEM FIRST. Memorize the map of the Tower and learn the way to the jewels, so that you can walk directly there. When we did this, we didn't have to stand in lines, just walked right in. Two hours later there was a long line outside the building.- There are fair amount of stairs to climb, if you truly want to see as much as you can in one visit.- Do take water with you. You can buy bottles of water, beer and soft drinks among other refreshments from the Tower too (the cafe on the East side) but they are a bit costly.- Reserve hours for this sight. One or two hours even is not enough!- If you are under 18, you can not not buy things like letter openers (shaped like swords) from the gift shops. I saw someone wanting to buy a letter opener, but she was declined when she turned out to be 17."
"August 13, 2015",Impressive Collection of Crown Jewels and Armor in Historic Castle/Prison,"Our trip to London was a bit last-minute so I rushed to put together a sightseeing itinerary. We knew we wanted to go to Tower of London to see the Crown Jewels (well, I did, anyway) but had no idea that we would be seeing multiple crowns (as well as staffs and swords) dating back to King Charles II (1660s); I expected only to see the current (Queen Elizabeth II) Crown Jewels. WOW!!!!  Spectacular. In addition, the armor of past kings on display in the White Tower, which we went through to get to the Crown Jewels, was amazing.Recommendations: (1) Plan a minimum of two hours. In this amount of time, you'll be able to view the exhibits in the White Tower, the Crown Jewels and take a brief walk on the wall surrounding the Tower of London and looking out onto the Tower Bridge. This was two hours at a fairly brisk pace. That said, don't be discouraged by the long line for the Crown Jewels. It actually moves really fast...about 10 minutes from the very end to the door. (2) check AT LEAST the day before you plan to visit  to see if there are any special events taking place on the grounds that you might want to see and plan your visit accordingly. We arrived at about 3 pm and had JUST missed a medieval jousting demonstration (horses, armor and all) because I wasn't aware if was occurring which was a bit of a bummer; (3) Realistically, you can easily spend a full day (or more) exploring the grounds and (4) No need to purchase tickets ahead of time. The grounds are quite expansive and can accommodate many people at once."
"July 28, 2015",Nice for a day trip,"The ideal time to visit London’s attractions are in mid-summer. But there again most of the fellow tourists already know that and hence it is extremely busy. A visit to the tower of London, adjacent to Thames and near the iconic London Bridge is a nice addition to one’s tourist itinerary."
"July 3, 2015","Interesting, Historic and Great Fun!!","I went here with my girlfriend recently.It is quite expensive but in my opinion it is well worth the money (£54 with a programme).The journey around took a long time which is great, several things to see, the crown jewels, the tower itself which is a 4 level museum, the royal fusiliers regiment HQ (I think it was theirs).Nice, reasonably priced cafe on site with great flapjacks.... and I know my flapjacks....All in all:Great visit.Super interesting.History is great.Architecture is beautiful.Loads to see."
"September 9, 2010",Take a free guided tour with yeoman warder,"The Tower is one of the ""must see"" places in London, hence very crowded. The best way to avoid queues is to visit in the morning or use a London Pass which entitles to a free entry from the group entrance. After getting in you can have a free map in different languages, but it is really worth to catch a guided tour which starts every hour near the main entrance. The guide is one of Yeoman warders who walks the group around the place telling a lot of funny and interesting stories related to the history of the Tower. After the tour is over it is possible to see indoor exhibits, however some of them like the Crown Jewels House requires a lot of waiting to get in. In case of limited time, take a walk over the walls where one of the towers exhibits copies of some of the crown jewels."
"March 27, 2010",One of London's must visit attractions,"The Tower of London was made for a really enjoyable afternoon out. After reading other reviews we had heard about the Yeoman tour, so decided to start our visit with this tour and we were not disappointed; it was absolutely brilliant. The Yeoman warder tour guide was funny, informative and answered all of our questions - and really made the first 50-60 minutes of our visit enjoyable. The tour included a visit to the Tower of London Chapel - which seemed to only be closed off unless you were with a guide. The Tower itself is a national icon; full of history and culture with each of its many rooms and buildings telling its own story. The audio tour was good and worth doing, as it keeps you occupied and interested for around 2 hours.If you go to London, make sure you go to the Tower!"
"October 13, 2009",Had a few unfortunate circumstances...,"To be sure, a visitor to London can't miss the Tower. I'd recommend it to everybody. With that said, my own trip to the Tower was marked by a few disappointments. On the day that we went, it was pouring rain. This being London, we decided to not let the rain stop us, and went ahead regardless. The rain does, however, stop the Beefeaters, apparently. Ours took us only to the Chapel, and gave us a brief and nearly inaudible historic summary. Left without a guided tour, we turned to the audio guides, which were great, but lengthy. I knew this attraction would be extensive, but I didn't realize it would take 5 hours! Be sure to leave yourself time so you don't feel rushed. Also, since the day was so wet, we couldn't sit down. Almost all the seating in the complex is outdoors, and these were soaked. My 60-something parents were really hurting by the middle of our stay. While we were visiting, the White Tour housed the Henry VIII: Dressed to Kill exhibit in honor of his 500th birthday. It was a really well-done exhibit, though the thoroughly modern displays detracted a bit from the historic feeling of this oldest part of the tower complex. Plus, it was packed. Be prepared for LOTS of people in that tower, all going up and down narrow stairways together. We did do well to follow previous reviewers' advice and go straight to the Crown Jewels first thing. By doing that section first, we had the jewels almost all to ourselves, which was a great experience. All in all, the Tower is certainly a world-class sight. You may, however, want to check your weather forecast and try to pick a drier day than we did."
"April 4, 2009",Pricey but worth it!,"Last weekend I went to the tower with my family including 7 year old grandson.  These tips from previous posters were helpful:1.  Go as EARLY as you can get your family moving2.  Definitely start with the Yeoman Warder [Beefeater] tour, even if the group is large they speak loudly and ours [Bob] invited all the kids up front.  It's included in the ticket price and gives you a good orientation to the history and the various buildings inside the complex.3.  Get your tickets ahead of time from 365tickets.com, you'll save a little money and also pick up from the group line which is much shorter.4. Eat a Wagamama, a Japanese noodle chain right outside the complex.Yes, it's expensive but you learn about the history of London going back 1000 years, and you are also right there on the Thames river with a good view of Tower Bridge and the HMS Belfast."
"March 6, 2009",A London Must See...But Pricey,"Our Hotel (The Tower) was right next door, so it was a easy to walk to 'Must See'.Firstly costs - Our first reaction was £32 for 2 adult tickets was a tad expensive, especially as a guide book was another £4.95, and an audio tour was another £4.00 per person, but on the plus side we easily spend 4 hours there, and it is incredibly interesting.We had lunch in the Restaurant which again was relatively costly, although the food was nice. They seemed a little under pressure and had no Forks or Spoons, and started handing out plastic ones, and they weren't that busy.We didn't take any of the Tours available, preferring to wander with the map and take our time. There is plenty of information printed on all the sights around the Tower to provide a good basic story of the Tower and its History. Nice shop too, but very few of the items for sale were Specific to the Tower."
"January 20, 2009",An amazing building and a must visit!,"This attraction cost about 17 pounds for an adult. I bought an additional audio guide for only 4 pounds. I found the audio guides to be a bit slow moving for me. I would also rather they not include ""first-hand"" accounts.The tower fort is quite impressive even entering the first gate. I caught up with a Yeoman Warder tour when I first entered. It was good but did not last too long. I was told these tours usually last 60 minutes. I'm not sure if it was because of the season or something else. He really only talked about the moat, traitors gate (water lane/water gate), white tower, tower green and the Chapel Royal. It was a good informative and funny tour but shorter than I expected. That was when I decided to purchase the audio guide.I ran out of time at the Tower. You really need 2-3 hours to discover it all. The crowing jewel of this location was, well, the crown jewels. Thankfully, because it was January there were fewer tourists. I was able to not wait in line at all to see them. They have it set up like a disney ride. The queue is long and winding (or could be if crowded) but there are plaques for each royal in one room and 3 seperate rooms with videos that pertain to the jewels. One is Queen Elizabeth II's procession to become the queen. Another describes the jewels that are in the collection, including the names and stories of some of the famous jewels. After that, it is into the vault to see them. They truly are amazing. My favorite was the gold punch bowl. It was huge.Definitely a must see when you visit London!"
"October 2, 2008",Best thing in London,"The Tower of London is definitely the most worthwhile thing to see whilst in London. There is so much history and it is so fascinating to see such a landmark in person. Don't miss the remains of the Roman wall on the other side of the street, next to the subway station."
"August 15, 2008",Ilustrious history,"A must-visit for all travellers to London. Experience England's illustrious (and infamous?) history and see upclose the crown jewels.Join the free Yeoman Warder Tour and find out how many English heads are beheaded in and around the Tower of London. The guide is informative and very entertaining with their sense of humour. You will learn a lot more about the towers and the tales behind them in the tower by following this one-hour tour. Well worth the time.Also, look out for the ravens in the grounds of the tower. They are a ""permanent"" feature there for centuries!"
"July 18, 2008",Well worth it,"We went in January, when the tourist crowds were not very big - and this was well worth the money and five hours spent there.  What a cool place!  Eat at the Wagamama's right nearby!  The Beefeater tour is a must!"
"February 5, 2008",The Tower is Tops!,"Visited the Tower of London with my family(wife and I and two teenagers, 17 and 15) in late December.  We got there when it first opened, and immediately went to see the Crown Jewels, which we had practically to ourselves; no crowds, had plenty of time to appreciate their splendor, and also time to watch the interesting video display.We also took a Warder's tour-an absolute must-and then spent the next several hours on our own.  It's an absolutely fabulous place and everyone in my family agreed it was the highlight of our visit to London.Being the end of December, it was quite chilly; also by the time we left-about Noon-it was also packed, so full of people it was tough to navigate.  I'd strongly suggest that if you travel at a high-tourist time, go first thing in the morning.But you have to visit-it's a great historic wonder."
"June 25, 2015","An important place in British history, included in London Pass",This place is one of the world’s most famous fortresses/royal palace. We spent around 3 hours here. It's worth to visit. A tour by Yeoman was fun and valuable (it's included in the price of an entry ticket).More about Visit the Tower of London with The London Pass http://goo.gl/WTxjq2
"June 9, 2015",Great Visit,Great Visit......enjoy.......This was an excellent way to spend a few hours in London..... recommend...
"March 28, 2015",Poor customer service,"Tried to visit yesterday with a valid 2for1 voucher I had, along with my required train tickets. However, it wasn't accepted with the supervisor stating it was a school holiday and the offer had been withdrawn. It certainly isn't a school holiday in the north, and by the looks of all the school children in their uniforms not in the south either. Decided to spend my money on a place that actually wanted my custom and left. Not worth the £25/person entry fee!"
"March 6, 2015",Good attraction,"It is recommended to take a tour with Yeoman Warder. It is enjoyable and provide you with the information about the place and the history. Don't take audio guide, you will pay 4 pounds just to listen to the same information from the tour.Tip: come before 11:00am, otherwise it will be crowded."
"November 2, 2014",We queued and queued,And after horrendous queues to pick up tickets and then horrendous queues to get through security we gave up before we even got in! Totally unrealistic queues during half term -don't do it! Disastrous visit. Children were gutted.
"October 31, 2014",Amazing time....,"Great day had by the four of us, Nanny, Mummy, Son (9) & Daughter (7).We got there early, we were there at 8:15am & walked round the whole site seeing every bit of the poppy moat display.We then got in the ToL queue at about 20-quarter to 9am, this meant that there was only a handful of people in front of us....unbeknown to us at the time, this also gave us a massive advantage to seeing the Crown Jewels with absolutely no waiting & hardly anyone in there with us. Straight after the CJ's we went to the Torture Tower, there was about 4-5 people in front of us so we didn't really wait.By the time we came out from the TT & went over to the Bloody Tower the queues had started to build up, from that point on the queues just got bigger & bigger for the Crown Jewels & the Torture Tower. It felt like we were ahead of the pack wherever we went, as we'd been in the main attractions first.We had no problems walking round the tops of all the walls & could take our time wherever we went, we didn't feel rushed & we saw & did everything.We really did have a fantastic time here, the kids thoroughly enjoyed everything. I love the way things are displayed or shown for you to understand what it was like, my children didn't get bored once & kept asking questions after each bit.It's really emotional seeing all the poppies in the moat & awful to know that everyone is a life lost to war. I'm so glad I bought one before they all sold out.One last thing...I pre-purchased our tickets online before we went, another 'phew' moment!!! As there was also a queue for entrance tickets.Totally & utterly recommend visiting here!!!!Carole : )"
"October 30, 2014",Gave up with queues!,"Have to start by saying the poppies are amazing and worth the trip.... But if your thinking like we did to book to go into the tower whilst visiting frankly don't bother as:1. The poppies are best viewed from outside the tower2. The overcrowding inside is an absolute disgrace. It appears that the tower management just want to keep selling tickets and are not worried about the experience their guests actually receive. We abandoned our visit after an hour and half, the two our wait to see the Crown Jewels and queues everywhere just proved too much and we wrote off the £100+ entry!! Talked to some staff and they are so embarrassed by the situation that apparently the beefeaters have petitioned for some controls. This needs to happen as until it does my advice to anybody would be to avoid which is a real shame for a national treasure that should be so enjoyable if better managed."
"October 28, 2014",Queue Gardens?,"I understand that this is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the UK. I also realise that I went during half term.BUT, they need a major shake up of how they do things. It took us about an hour waiting in one of the many sales kiosks to get our tickets. Not cheap either.My major complaint here is, if they know that you have no chance of seeing everything in a day, they should reduce the price.The line for the Crown Jewels exhibition was about 1 hour 30 minutes of waiting. There were queues for everything, with people asking ""excuse me, what is this queue for?"" There was no Alton Towers style zigzagging, just random snaking lines everywhere.No thought has been put in here, They just open the flood gates. They should either limit the numbers, sell online only or better still, give you a time slot when you can see the different exhibitions.Actually, the shops didn't have much of a queue, however, I didn't fancy spending £25 for a mug and £4.95 for a sandwich.Seriously taking the p**s all round."
"October 26, 2014","""A field of Poppies""","We wanted to see the London Poppies but had already been to the tower this year and did not want to pay another 22 pounds each. To be honest we went at the wrong time(1 Pm on Sunday afternoon). The crowds were vast with people pushing, shoving and spilling on to the busy road.Having said that the poppies were amazing, thousands upon thousands adorn the grass moat floor. The sight of the tide of red colour is very powerful. Overall this is well worth a view from the path, but please wait for a quiet time to enjoy your visit."
"October 18, 2014",Poppies are a must see - but hurry they won't be there for much longer,Went to view the poppies and they were a spectacular sight.  This Tower of London is a great historical site and the crown jewels are definitely worth seeing.  You can see the poppies without paying the entrance fee.
"October 4, 2014","""Blood swept lands and seas of red""","Even if you do not have time to visit the spectacular and historic interiors of the Tower of London, please please please make sure you make the time to see the spectacular art installation which is being constructed in the former moat of the Tower.  888,642 hand-made ceramic poppies (created in a studio in Pride Park in Derbyshire) are being progressively placed; each poppy represents one of the 888, 246 British and Colonial military fatalities of World War 1. The last poppy will be placed at 11:00 on 11/11/2014. The installation is titled 'Blood swept lands and seas of red!.  It is seriously beautiful, poignant, and deeply moving.  It's free, and you can't miss it when you get to  the Tower - you certainly don't have to enter the Tower to see it.  And it makes the likes of the Turner Prize, with its usual controversy of the rubbish the experts call art, a joke!  This is art!  This is memorable!  This is what London is really all about.  Do not miss it!"
"August 6, 2014",Historical Castle and Prison,"Interesting place, the prices are a bit steep!  I bet a LOT of people visiting on Aug. 5 didn't realize Duke & Dutchess William & Kate as well as Prince Harry were there!Awesome Tips:If you don't have online, pre-bought tickets, don't bother waiting in the insane lineups. Instead, plan ahead. We had a day travel card on the underground and stopped at Liverpool station where we exited to find the London Tourist Office (check their hours online before you go). It's located across platforms 5 & 6. Here, an adult ticket is 18.50 and virtually NO lineup. Grab the tickets and check back into the underground using your travel card (or oyster card if that's what you're using) and get off at London Tower station (very close by). Once you exit the London Tower station, mind the signs for 'TICKET HOLDERS' -- you will keep left and essentially walk around the entire Tower of London complex on the river Thames side which is the pre-purchased ticket entrance. Also once inside, skip the audio tours. It's a money grab! Wait for a Yeoman tour (they take large groups of people every half hour or so from either entrances). Another tip: they don't post times of the next tour. Don't worry, just loiter around the signed area for the next tour. It's included in your ticket price, it lasts an hour, and is worth it. Another tip is don't head straight for the Crown Jewels or even the Tower itself. Watch the crowds a after your Yeoman tour. If they dwindle, queue up."
"July 30, 2014",Historically important but very pricey attraction,"The Tower of London is probably the most important historical building standing in England today.  Located and the north bank of the River Thames, this castle was the English seat of power for many centuries.  Founded by William as part of the Norman conquest of English in 1066, the Tower of London has rich history which extends almost a thousand years into the past  Today, you can visit the Tower of London and see quite a bit of the castle grounds including the White Tower, Medieval Palace and now you can see the Royal Crown Jewels, which are display at the Tower of London.  You can visit and see the highlights at the Tower of London in an hour or less but this makes the visit very pricy (entrance £22 for adults, £11 for children). To ensure better value for money, it is worth trying to see as much as you can at the Tower of London.  Visit their website to see recommended ways of spending 2 or 3 hours at this attraction, there is good description of everything everything available to do and see online.  For those who enjoy leisurely visits, its possible to spend up to a 1/2 a day at the Towers of London.  For those not as keen on castle visits, you can also simply walk around the Tower of London, enjoying its presence on the north side of the Thames River.  It rests beside what is probably the most famous bridge in the world, Tower Bridge, which you can also consider visiting when spending time in this part of London.  In the end, we find the Tower of London quite pricy compared to other important attractions in London and similar castle/palace visits in other European capitals.  You might even argue that beyond the Crown Jewels, the attraction is a bit underwhelming compared to many European counterparts. However, it can be a fun place to visit and a nice place for families with children to spend time during their holiday."
"July 10, 2014",Far Too Crowded,"First of all we got there early - right when they opened and paid a small fortune even taking into account the 2 for 1 deal to get in.  We went to the crown jewels first just as you all here on TA had told me too.  I'm glad we did otherwise we wouldn't have been able to see them.  Even still it took an hour to see them.  The staff stood back and let people cut in line - and in some cases encouraged it! By the time we got to some of the cases people pushed us out of the way. In all cases the staff stood back and watched looking bored.  Afterward we went through the white tower and a few of the exhibits and in all cases it was so over crowded that we couldn't get close enough to read the signs or really take into consideration what we were seeing.  And we aren't the sort of people who take 6 hours in a museum.  Some of the weapons were cool and it was fun to be inside the Tower of London - something I think we all learned about as kids - but there simply has to be a better way to organize things.  Either put a cap on the number of people allowed or simply make them wait in a line.  I know that it would require paying out more of the outrageous admission costs to get people who will do more than stand around, look bored, and be rude but it would have made something that a lot of people look forward to - including me - into a much better experience. You honestly could not pay me to go back!"
"June 11, 2014",History ... History .... History. Must Do in London,"When in London, please do spend half a day at the Tower of London. Tickets for adults is £ 22 and child is ~ £ 11 if booked on the spot. Try to get it online then it is ~ 25% cheaper or try to get into a group and do a group booking then it is even cheaper. Get off at the Tower Station in the London Underground and walk to the entrance. Tower of London, is a historic castle on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. The Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history. It was besieged several times and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. The Tower has served variously as an armoury, a treasury, a menagerie, the home of the Royal Mint, a public records office, and the home of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom. From the early 14th century until the reign of Charles II, a procession would be led from the Tower to Westminster Abbey on the coronation of a monarch. In the absence of the monarch, the Constable of the Tower is in charge of the castle. This was a powerful and trusted position in the medieval period. In the late 15th century the castle was the prison of the Princes in the Tower. Under the Tudors, the Tower became used less as a royal residence, and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery.Once inside wait for the ‘Yeoman’ Tour. It is usually held every one hour. If you have to wait for sometime then go to the ‘moat’. The ‘moat’ is now a Grassy Field where they usually show old swords, bow and arrow etc. The ‘Yeoman’ would introduce to the tour and the history of the Tower. There could be a huge crowd built up so try to get in front of him & try to record his speech. He would point out to a place outside the Tower where public hangings would take place. Then he would take you inside , stopping at various stops to give a quick speech on the history. The tour would end at the ‘Chapel’ and then you are free to roam the Tower at your leisure.  Apart from the Yeoman, the other attractions are :--	Crown Jewels - Crown Jewels denotes the regalia and vestments worn by the sovereign of the United Kingdom during the coronation ceremony and at other state functions. The term refers to the following objects: the crowns, sceptres (with either the cross or the dove), orbs, swords, rings, spurs, colobium sindonis, dalmatic, armills, and the royal robe or pall, as well as several other objects connected with the ceremony itself. The tradition of housing the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London probably dates from the reign of Henry III. The Jewel House was built specifically to house the royal regalia, including jewels, plate, and symbols of royalty such as the crown, sceptre, and sword. When money needed to be raised, the treasure could be pawned by the monarch. -	Do not miss the Koh-i-Noor diamond in the middle of the front cross (the diamond was most recently acquired by the East India Company and became part of the British Crown Jewels when Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India in 1877.-	The Kings's Sceptre with the Cross was made in 1661, and is so called because it is surmounted by a cross. In 1910, it was redesigned to incorporate the Cullinan I, also known as the Great Star of Africa, which at over 530 carats (106 g) is the largest cut clear diamond in the world. During the coronation, the monarch bears the Sceptre with the Cross in the right hand.-	Ravens - Ravens of the Tower of London are a group of captive Common Ravens which live in the Tower of London. The group of ravens at the Tower comprises at least seven individuals (six required, with a seventh in reserve). The presence of the ravens is traditionally believed to protect the Crown and the Tower; a superstition holds that ""If the Tower of London ravens are lost or fly away, the Crown will fall and Britain with it.-	Yeoman Warders are also known as ‘Beefeaters’ - It is thought their nickname is derived from their position in the Royal Bodyguard, which permitted them to eat as much beef as they wanted from the king's table.Tower of London should not be missed at any cost !!!"
"May 25, 2014",Wow. Didn't think an attraction could be more boring.,"Total rip off!The tour consists of a bunch of signs telling you what might have been there. The tower of beasts is nothing but a bunch of animal drawings they assume the king might have had. The Crown Jewels are just a series of replicas on display that take at most 10 minutes to see. The hall of Kings is a collection of simulated armor and fake swords. And best of all after paying the outrageous admission for this junk, they have donation boxes every 10 feet. Skip this one for sure."
"July 23, 2013",Terry Humphries (Yeoman Warder) Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations,"The historical significance of this place cannot be understated. It is an impressive piece of living history via the amazing crown jewels and the brave fusiliers regiment, albeit you have to pay quite a bit for the privilege of experiencing it first hand. As a plus, if you want to engage in casual banter or discover the origin behind the choreography of the Queen's Guard marching (more specifically, I found their way of fist clenching to be wimpy, and wanted to understand if it could be interpreted as a non-provocative statement, or a sign of lost elegance), you could have the misfortune to stumble upon the said Beefeater T. Humphries, who will immediately be offended by your question and gratulate you with the categorization of stupid. Initially, I assumed a reaction as such to be the result of poor T. Humphries eating too much prion-laden beef, but on further reflection I ended up with a conclusion, which I embedded in the review title. Normally, I would have filed an official complaint with the Chief Warder, but good luck finding a way to do just that."
"March 18, 2013",Points to Make your Visit Memorable,"The Tower of London is an amazing place that is full of history, stories and very interesting artifacts and jewellery. A few suggestions to make your visit enjoyable. First, purchase your tickets online before you go to London. When you arrive at TOL, you pick up the actual tickets at the guest shop, you avoid the lineups and you enter through the VIP entrance. Second, try to get to the Tower first thing in the morning. We arrived at 10 AM and just walked in to see the Crown Jewels and we were able to stay and see the crowns a few times. An hour after we saw the Crown Jewels, there was a 5 hour lineup to get inside! Third, join the Beefeater tours because with the tour you gain entrance to the Chapel Royal of St. Peter and Vincula which is not open to the general public. Plus the Beefeaters have a wealth of knowledge and interesting facts! Fourth, go to see the Crown Jewels in the Waterloo Block as soon as you get into the Tower grounds.This is the one building with the longest lineups. Fifth, the White Tower is the largest building with the most things to see and read. Be careful! Once you enter the building you are directed by arrows, barriers and personnel to follow the path that takes you from the front door up all the floors then into the basement and then out. We went in to take a quick peek but we were trapped inside and had to do the full tour. So be sure you have the time and the patience before you enter.  Sixth, walk the ramparts (walls) - it is very interesting to be walking on 1100 year old stones while looking at some of London's newest buildings (The Shard and the Gherkin)! Lastly, make sure that you leave at least 3 hours to see this attraction. We were there for just over 3 hours and we still did not see everything! We will be back."
"August 25, 2012",Wheelchair guests avoid,"I took my 18 year old daughter in her wheelchair. We were charged £17 for her and I was admitted free. Great deal you might think.... No, it was a rip off. Due to the cobbles we found it difficult to negotiate the site and had to abandon the trip for fear of breaking her chair! Only the perimeter path was ""accessible"" together with the jewel house. Absolutely nothing else.  £5 would have been appropriate! I was also told by a seller that I should be happy as I was admitted free - did she expect me to abandon my daughter and do the tour alone! Don't bother!"
"August 11, 2012",Must see is an understatement.,"This place is pure history and you get the chance to walk around in the footsteps of all those Kings & Queens and other assorted royalty and other world famous characters. The Yeoman Wardens ARE fantastic. Simon,Simon,Simon was the MAN who took our group through some history and fascinating facts about Tower of London , the Yeoman Wardens themselves and more titbits of history. The tour ""flies"" by and then you have the opportunity to look at all those jewels!!!. The cafe's are great to sit down and let it sink in. The buildings are nearly 1000 years old. Some of the stairways and corridors are small but this adds to the GENUINE feel of the attraction. I know other trip advisors have said it but it really is A MUST SEE."
"December 30, 2019",Missing staff,There was a lot of visitors this Monday 30 December. The waiting line was impressive and we unfortunately had to leave it after 90 minutes of patience with our 2 young kids and tens of people jumping the queue which was without any control. The entrance price is high enough to finance better service to visitors. Pre-booking visiting slots should be proposed.
"December 25, 2019",So much History at London Tower,"If you do one stop in London to cover experiential history this is the place to go.  It covers hundreds of years in short digestible chunks that is easy for the kids to follow along.  Walk thru the castle see the Crown Jewels, see the difference in architecture, armor and government over the centuries.  Best to eat before you go - there’s a small snack shop with limited options and you may want to spend a few hours there."
"December 22, 2019",We Saw and Learned Quite A Bit,"We only had 2 hours to see everything at the Tower of London and we made good use of our time. Man or woman, be sure to visit the Crown Jewels as even swords are in this display. The armory was impressive and walking the armaments was a nice little tour. We enjoyed it very much. "
"December 17, 2019",Take the Tour!,"I very much enjoyed the tour of the Tower of London. I do not think I would have enjoyed it as much or gotten as much out of the visit had we not taken the tour given by the Yeoman Warder (aka beefeater). Our tour guide was fantastic, but this is no ordinary tour guide. The yeoman form the Royal Bodyguard and each one has at least 22 years in the armed forces before they can apply for this position. Our Yeoman was very knowledgeable and entertaining, but he also took his job and position very seriously. This was a highlight of my trip. Plus, of course, the crown jewels are located here which was incredible to see."
"December 15, 2019",Worth it! ,"Ordered our tickets online via Klook to save some money, which worked great. Did the yeoman tour and had an awesome time. The warden was informative, funny and spoke with passion!I would recommend going early in the day, because it gets crowded quickly. Luckily there is lots to see, so there is lots of things to discover! "
"December 4, 2019",Jewels and Ravens,"Took the advice of some tour books I read beforehand and got there first thing in the morning (purchased my ticket online).  Headed straight for the crown jewels to avoid lines that would soon form, then took the beefeater tour, which was amusingly given by celebrity guide Alan Skaife, aka Ravenmaster, then did a tour (actually a one-on-one Q&A since no one else attended) of the white tower, then some free roaming.  A pretty good solo itinerary which still took over 2 hours. I think 3 hours would have been comprehensive, but I had other places to go and the crowds were getting thick.  Pretty compulsory for a London visit."
"November 22, 2019",Exploring Medieval Times,"I never thought this Tower would hold so much history! It’s like seeing Lord of the Rings, Hobbits, Snow White and the Huntsman come to life. There were characters on site as well...And actual British Royal Soldiers on post. So many towers to explore, each holding a story. There’s also a fun gaming area towards the end of the tour. Don’t forget to see the White Tower which is in the middle. We paid our tickets with a tour company not at the door. It allowed us to bypass the line. There’s a skating rink next door too!"
"November 22, 2019",Great history and the British Crown Jewels,"If you’re in London, you have to visit the tower. In spite of the name, it is a full Fort and Castle, not just a tower. Lots of interesting history. I highly recommend the Yeoman guided tour is free and definitely worth the time. The British Crown Jewels are housed in the Gallery, and also make time to tour the White Tower and The Chapel of St John the Evangelist.  It’s easy to spend 2-3 hours touring the grounds."
"November 22, 2019",Amazing place,Must see while in London
"November 5, 2019","This was a great place to visit to learn about history, explore historic buildings, see the Crown Jewels and more while learning about some of the stories of those who spent time there both grisly and take. There was a lot to explore and see! ",Great day out
"October 25, 2020","I am a Londoner who shamefully has never been to the Tower of London so we took today to visit.  It’s an incredible place with so much history and well worth a visit.  We hired the audio tour and it was well worth it, also the staff are always willing to answer questions if you want to ask.  There were absolutely no crowds which is a shame for the finances but fantastic for visitors as no queuing!",Wonderful visit
"October 23, 2020","First visit to the Tower of London as always put off by the crowds. Visited early October, eerily quiet but ideal for getting photos.  We arrived early but walked straight in, no issues with access. Very covid safe which meant one way systems in place. Some areas closed because of safe access issues but this was to be expected. It didn’t spoil the visit at all. No queues for the Crown Jewels which was great aswell. Beautiful surroundings steeped in history with very knowledgeable staff. The Uber boat also stops right outside so easy access from anywhere.",Birthday day out at the tower 
"September 16, 2020","So due to covid 19 our plans for my daughters 30th has to be curtailed and after some thought we decided a day at the tower followed by afternoon tea would be lovely. The Tower is immaculate, the Crown Jewels simply breathtaking and the queues non existent due to the current situation! The Beefeaters were helpful and really friendly ! Superb day out made even better by the lackOfPeople",Very beautiful
"August 16, 2020","Long lines to access the British Crown Jewels, but it's really worth it even once in a lifetime. Very well kept, they even have a space where crows live. Really spectacular.",GO NOW while it's quiet.
"August 16, 2020",First visit for 40 years. Very quiet due to restricted numbers. Take advantage while it lasts.  Not fully open but plenty to keep you interested for an hour or so.,The Tower of London not to be missed on any visitors agenda.
"August 6, 2020","I first went to the Tower in December 1957 as a National Service soldier in the Royal Fusiliers, I stayed there for ten weeks carrying out basic training, before joining my Regiment, in which I served for two years, twenty months of which I was posted abroad.I still visit the tower Often at the age of eighty four for Regimental reunions, Over the years I have got to know this wonderful historic place very well and it’s easy to say it really is a Crown Jewell in London’s great history.Recently there has been some talk of making the Beefeaters redundant, Im’e normally slow to anger but this utterly stupid decision is beyond belief, these totally knowledgeable are an integral part of the Tower and all in stands for.Leave well alone.",Don't go at present
"July 26, 2020","Really disappointed, I don't think it should be open at present. I have been here before and had a great time. However at present more than half of the tower is closed. This should be made clear on the website before you book tickets. There's a one way system which lots of guests are not following; furthermore during the crown jewels section no one was following social distancing. The workers should be monitoring social distancing, we were standing back and allowing others to see the jewels then would step forward to look and yet others would be pushing in and leaning over us. Then to top it all off they make you exit via the shop to which they make you wear a mask to enter the shop and leave - bear in mind this is the only way out luckily we had masks. I must add the staff in the shop had no masks on. Reqlly disappointed and complete rip off of £25 per ticket. Don't go here at present - especially as hardly anything is open!",Could Spend a Whole Day
"March 23, 2020","Depending on your level of interest you could spend almost a full day wandering around. Recommend getting there when they open to be the crowds. If you do so, you can immediately go see the Crown Jewels without a crowd. Then retrace your steps back to the front to join a Beefeater Tour. They provide a good rounded introduction to the Tower --highly recommended. Once the tour is complete, take your time and explore the White Tower, Chapel, etc...",Family vacation 
"January 3, 2020","Very nice venue with everything from jewels to armory, interesting for everyone in our group. London Pass recommended to avoid ticket line ",Amazing historical location with so much to see 
"December 31, 2019","You can spend hours in this incredible piece of history, listening to the Beefeaters or audio guides, seeing the high quality exhibits. However if you don’t want to queue for an hour plus for the Crown Jewels you need to be early and go straight to this. ",One of the best sites to see in London
"October 22, 2019","Simply, this is one of the most interesting sites in London.  One can learn a lot about the history of England and the Tower.Here are two suggestions for a good visit:  (1) Get there as early as you can because this is a very popular attraction.  (2) Take the free Beefeater tour before you begin exploring on your own.  It will make your experience so much more rewarding.  Our Beefeater was Sean and he was great.  The tour starts every 30 minutes on the hour and half hour from just inside the entrance, down in the moat.",Reputation precedes it - rightly so
"October 19, 2019",The reputation of the Tower of London is like no other. What this fortress has seen over the centuries is incredible. Preserving the past and educating people about history is just part of what makes a visit to the Tower special,Definitely worth a visit
"October 18, 2019","This bastion of history doesn’t disappoint.  If you are wanting an authentic slice of London - you cannot get closer than this.  Steeped in the gory history of London’s monarchy the Yoeman Tours are captivating, funny and informative. The staff are extremely helpful and charming.  If you’re not in the mood for a tour the grounds are excellently laid out so that you can explore all four corners without spending unnecessary time retracing you’re steps.  The crowned jewels, chapel and endless array of armour speak volumes of the wealth and might in the establishing of England. There is even a mini changing of the guard. Ravens and classic shots of the Tower bridge make it alone. ",Must See While in London
"October 18, 2019","I get it... there are many, many things to see in London; however, the Tower of London is so incredibly entrenched in history that it’s a must for anyone passing through town.  The kind of place where you find yourself thinking “ok wow I’m actually in England”.  Catch a Beefeater tour for the best experience (no need to schedule into one, they have predetermined departure times and you can tag into any of them).  Beefeaters (official name: Yeoman Wardens) must meet 3 criteria to become a warden at the tower, I’ll save it for the explanation at the tour but let’s just say it’s intense and the criteria cannot be met by an average Joe.  These guys seriously know their stuff and all have that true English wit.  Did I mention the CROWN JEWELS live within an exhibit at the Tower of London?  So amazing.  Honestly, my parents had recommended I visit the Tower and I agreed thinking it would be your standard castle, didn’t even realize the jewels were there. It’s very cool for all ages and really exceeded my expectations.  Not to mention the exit leads you to a beautiful riverside walk!",Fascinating
"October 14, 2019","Advisable to go early and head straight to the dazzling Crown Jewels to beat the crowds. Fabulous collection and fascinating to learn of their history. We then took our time to explore other parts of the Tower complex - plenty to see, skillfully displayed and explained. Highly recommended.",Take a beefeater tour
"October 14, 2019","There is a lot to see here, you can spend a lot of time trying to get it all in.  The tour is free, try to catch it or just join it if you see if happening.",A must-visit
"October 13, 2019","My second visit to the tower was just as good as the first, if not better. I did the Yeoman Warder tour with Scott Kelly (#beefy409!), and he was fantastic! The tour was educational and highly entertaining. We spent close to 4 hours here, and enjoyed every minute. Well worth the entrance fee.",Tremendous 
"October 10, 2019",The crown jewels were amazing.  The vast amount of history in the entire place.  There is only one things I can say. You have to put it on your list while in London!,I finally did it after 6 years & 2 trips to the UK
"October 10, 2019","The wait was worth it!It was not a pleasant weather day in London; we chose to walk along the Thames rather than doing the Underground; bad choice!However, the walk around the Tower was clear & dry.It is an amazing place, nooks & crannies everywhere, so much to see, so much to understand.I will do it again, even if it does take me another 6 years of waiting!",Tower of London
"October 10, 2019",We weren't sure what to expect we went straight through with the London passes which was great  we did an audio tour then we thought let's do a guided tour with a beefeater which was brilliant ...very interesting place with so much history...a must do I  my opinion,Incredible site
"November 4, 2019","The Tower of London is made up of many buildings. The crown jewel part is well worth the long lines if you want to see the crown jewels. No photos are permitted. Another area has the old armor and another the baptismal font, challis's, etc. Very interesting. The Ravens are kept at the Tower. ",Amazing!
"November 3, 2019","So much to see, the Beefeater we followed was very knowledgeable and great with a joke.  Only wished we were able to take pictures of the Crown Jewels ",Excellent for the Crown Jewels and Yeomen Experience
"October 29, 2019","Honestly, this wasn't my favorite tourist attraction in London but it deserves a 5 star rating for the Crown Jewels and the excellent tour offered by the Yeomen Warders, the latter of which was AWESOME! It's funny seeing a recent review that mentioned a lack of armory, which I actually felt was a bit overboard and repetitive. I can only look at so many swords! Obviously, this is personal preference.We toured in early September in the morning, although we didn't arrive exactly at opening time. Given that, I was a bit worried that we would have to wait forever to see the Crown Jewels and that it would be an overwhelming experience. Luckily, there was really no wait and the crowds weren't too bad. I thought it was funny that they had a moving sidewalk that takes you by the majority of the jewels but it's actually a great idea to prevent people from parking themselves in front of the glass and blocking the view for others. You can keep going around if you want to spend more time looking. It was annoying that SO MANY tourists disregarded the clear ""No Photos"" signs and symbols (camera with a big slash through it for those who don't speak English) as the staff had to keep yelling at people to stop taking photos. I believe you can take photos everywhere else at the Tower, just not the Crown Jewels.Again, we so very much enjoyed the impressive Yeomen tour and have the utmost respect for their service. They provided an engaging and entertaining narration of the amazing history of this place. Not to be missed.",Just as interesting the second time around
"October 29, 2019","I have visited the tower twice. First late in the afternoon on beautiful November day 2015 and An early morning dreary day 10/25/19. At both visits there were NO crowds. We used the London pass and walked right in. ( Other reviews commented on crowds we had none at either visit). This time I took the beefeater tour and it was very entertaining. Gary was funny, informative and entertaining. Then we walked right into the Crown Jewels and finished with a walk around the tower wall which has amazing views. The only crowd we ran into was in the delicious but unorganized cafeteria. ",Palace PASS!!!
"October 28, 2019","My group got family memberships to the Historic Royal Palaces and visited three palaces for the price it would have cost to visit one.  And it provides a discount in the cafes and shops.  The Tower of London was the first my group visited and it became the BEST bit of the trip for some of our group members.  The crown jewels, the history, the beefeaters, the tour, the cafe.  It's all FANTASTIC.  DO NOT MISS THIS JEM!",Beefeater Scott Kelly is the BEST!
"October 26, 2019",I did not know what to expect when we arrived at the Tower of London.  They were having a guided tour and we decided to have someone show us around.  Beefeater Scott Kelly was assigned to do the tour AND it was his birthdayHe is very personable and informative.  There were several kids in the group and he kept their attention through the whole tour.  I really enjoyed my day at the Tower of London.  It would not have been as exciting if we had not had the tour with Beefeater # 409!!!,Excellent wish we had more time to explore
"October 25, 2019",Tower of London was one of the main reasons why we went to London. Got tickets easily and no queue so lucky from what people say. Inside it’s magnificent like a TARDIS. Short queue for Crown Jewels also and this is very well done. Loved seeing the Ravens and armed guards in their bearskin hats. ,Amazing experience 
"October 24, 2019","Visiting the Tower of London was the best! The weather wasn’t in our favor. It was cold and rainy, so I can only imagine how much better the experience would have been minus that. Please make sure you have access to a map. The grounds are crazy confusing. I arrived right at opening (‪9am‬) and went straight to the Crown Jewels. Plan to do that first to avoid the long queues. Huge thanks to the nice, funny Yeoman Warders who pointed me in the right direction for the tour. I was so lost lol! We visited one of the museums, which was quite ineresting and made it to the Yeoman tour just in time. Due to the rain, the tour was in the chapel and we heard some very interesting stories about the tower and the executions. Wow, just wow! Our last stop was the tower itself. Be prepared to walk up and down stairs if you want to get the full experience. Going up was okay, but we had to take a full spiral staircase all the way down. It was definitely an experience!",History brought to life
"October 23, 2019","I had never been in this iconic complex before (""Tower"" doesn't quite explain it properly) and ended up spending more time there than I'd planned. Things were certainly livened up by Yeoman/Beefeater Scott Kelly who quickly won his audience over. His black sense of humour had everyone in stitches but it didn't detract from the sometimes awful history of the place. I certainly came away from the place with a new-found appreciation for it. The British Crown Jewels are also here, of course. Still, I found myself coming away thinking more about the many people who had been imprisoned in the various buildings in the Tower. The entrance price is steep but there is plenty to see. The staff are also pleasant and friendly. I visited early on a weekday in mid October so the crowds weren't bad at all. I'm told it's an entirely different story during the summer.",Walk in history
"October 22, 2019","Wonderful day. Not overly crowded but the line, or should I say queue, for to see the Crown Jewels was excessively long all day. However the other Tower of London highlights were not that crowded and just as interesting.  The Tower of London is a great historical landmark and rich in world shaping history.  It also sits right next to one of the most iconic landmarks in London the Tower Bridge. If your interested in history then this is a must see as it was for me. I purchased my tickets before leaving America from the Historic Royal Palaces web site. No waiting.",Awesome Historical Experience!
"July 9, 2019",Well worth the visit. We took a water taxi from the Emankment pier and landed right at the Tower. Wandering around as a self guided tour was great and took 2 hours to see all the major areas. We attended at 10AM when it first opened and the line moved quickly. It gets VERY busy by mid-morning. The line up to view the jewels ques up immediately. Worth the visit. Warning - do not buy a “skip the line pass” online like I did. It is a waste of time as everyone has to line up. You are only buying advanced tickets. Anyone can take the Beefeater guide as well; that is not unique to any online offerings. ,Must see but get there early 
"July 8, 2019","I recommend the free guide tour with the yeoman. Very interesting and funny but does get busy, so get there just as it opens at 9. We had to buy our tickets at the door and they didn’t open ticket booths until 9am so I recommend buying tickets prior and printing them off before you go! You can’t show some tickets off your phone. Also, see the Crown Jewels first!! The line will get ridiculously long the longer you leave it!! ",Buy Tickets Directly Instead
"July 8, 2019",We loved visiting the Tower of London and our Beefeater tour was excellent but purchasing this package requires you to stand in the Group Ticket line first and then the general entrance line second.  So it's double queuing.  We arrived before opening time and were surprised to find out that the Group Ticket office opens at exactly the same time as the general entrance line.  Didn't save us any time at all.,Arrive early and head straight to the Crown Jewels!
"July 2, 2019","This incredible site needed 4 plus hours to see.  But best tip we received was to get there early by 9.30am to buy tickets or line up and then head straight to the Crown Jewels so as to avoid the plus 90 minute queues later in the day!  The rest you can do in your own time, despite the crowds.",Walking in the steps of Royalty
"June 26, 2019",Thoroughly enjoyed the Beefeater tour. Our Beefeater was called Laurence and he was very knowledgeable and entertaining. He explained the important aspects of the history of the buildings which make up the Tower of London in a way which was suitable for all ages and enjoyed banter with the crowd.We didn't queue to see the Crown Jewels due to the length of the queue but saw all other important buildings. The food in the on-site cafe was expensive but this it to be expected. A good choice of cakes and food and the room was clean and table were cleared quickly by the staff.I advise you to get there early and go and see the Crown Jewels first to avoid having to queue for a long time.,Huge and Beautiful
"June 24, 2019",I just got back from London last night and had to do a review on this place. I am very into history and loved the period of the Tudors (although it was quite a bloody timeframe). I was so excited to see the Tower knowing this was Ann Boleyn's final resting place. It was quite a walk around inside but worth it. There are shops you can purchase various items from if you want to take some history back with you which I of course did. Buy your tickets online in advance and you will have a very easy entrance.,Fantastic!  See the jewels first.
"June 22, 2019",This is an absolutely amazing place.DO NOT BUY TICKETS FROM VIATOR FOR SKIPPING THE LINE.  We did - got there at 10 - huge lines - had to wait to buy group tickets and were told by the clerk that no one skips the line and that they had told Viator to stop selling these tickets as they are a scam but to no avail as they are still for sale.There is a ticket line and a security line.  The London Pass allows one to skip the ticket line which would be great as it is quite long.  The security line is really long but moves quickly.  Once inside go directly to the Crown Jewels.  We were there at 10:30 and only waited 20 minutes - within an hour the line was about 2 hours long.  I was skeptical about how interesting the jewels would be - they are quite amazing to see - definitely make this a priority.Tours - the Yeoman Warder guides are very interesting and funny - skip any outside tour company and just join a free Yeoman (Beefeater) guided tour. Definitely worth a visit!,Visit to Tower of London
"June 21, 2019","Advantage of tour was tickets purchased ahead of time eliminated the need to wait in line. Beefeater tour was wonderful, but I think that is also included in tickets purchased on tower of London’s website. Not sure of other advantages to purchasing through trip advisor.",Well worth a visit
"June 20, 2019",Went for the first time today and loved every minute. My favorite thing was the Bloody Tower...but a close second was the Crown Jewels. So much history to learn and refresh my memory with.  My biggest suggestion would be to get there 2 minutes before they open and get in line for your tickets (if you didn’t buy them in advance). We were shocked at how much longer the lines were 1-2 hours after opening. ,wonderful history
"June 19, 2019","This was our first stop on our London itinerary and it was worth it.  The Crown Jewels exhibit was great, and the history behind Tower of London is amazing.",Best of London
"May 30, 2019","If you're wanting old London and monarch history, this is a must see. The best site we visited during our 3 days in the city. Go as close to opening time as possible when the line is shorter and moves quickly, and go straight to the crown jewels. Doing that got us right in and viewing the most popular part. The White Tower is also amazing right in the center. Loved all the nooks and spaces throughout the entire grounds.",A historic royal fortress
"May 29, 2019","Entry charges are around 27 pounds including donation. one can choose to pay donation or not. For students the charges are around 19 pounds. Located majestically along the river Thames it over looks the tower bridge. Initially it was a prison later converted to castle. Here one can visit to know the royal life of British kings and queens. Many jewels, scepters and crowns are kept here. There is also a war museum inside.",Go early to miss the queues
"May 29, 2019",This is our second time of going and so we went straight to the Crown Jewels as we didn’t go last time. We got there about half ten prepared for a long wait but though the queue went past the barriers it was moving so we weren’t just standing around. After about 20 minutes we were in. There is lots of information and glitz and glamour. Good to find out more about the history of the monarchy and see the famous Jewels. Very well organised and authentic. Liked seeing the soldiers and the ravens and the grandeur of it all. After we had lunch and wandered round we saw the queue for the Crown Jewels again. By now it had grown so long it was snaking right back down past the cafe. So by half one the queue must have been well over an hour.,Worthwhile seeing
"May 28, 2019","I’ve been twice to the Tower of London, the first was in winter and ran out of time to see the whole place properly. On this visit we made sure we arrived earlier! Magnificent and interesting is all I can say. Definitely worthwhile visiting and seeing the Crown Jewels. ",Loved it 
"May 28, 2019",Fabulous to see the white tower and of course highlight of the Crown Jewels.  Definitely a must see when visiting London ,The jaw dropping Tower Of London
"May 28, 2019",We arrived 30 minutes before It opened just incase there was a huge line. Bit it actually wasn't that bad. If you arrive early there are a few places near buy to grab a quick bite and also take pictures of the tower bridge. The line went quickly and we were inside the grounds fast. Maps of the place are very helpful. There is so much to see. You can take pictures every except inside the jewel tower. The jewel tower is very impressive with its crown jewels on display. Simply breath taking. We had the London pass which gave us entry to the tower of London. This is a must see. There is a gift shop and bathrooms inside. Alot of stairs to climb so keep that in mind. So much to see and absolutely beautiful place. ,Great History and So Much To See
"May 28, 2019","My husband was surprised at how much there was to see here. You can cover it in as little as an hour or you can spend several hours. It all depends on how much you want to see and how much detail you want to learn. There are many towers and buildings that you can enter on your own with a self-guided map. If you choose, you can listen to a Beefeater, or yeoman Warder, who will review some history and interesting information about the Tower. There are also warders in some of the buildings who are happy to answer your questions. The White Tower, completed in 1097 and once the tallest building in London, today has a lot of armor. The famous Ravens are outside to view. The Medieval Palace, created by Henry III in 1220, displays the elegant style of the day. The Queen's House is the official residence of the Tower's governor and guarded. And of course, the Crown Jewels are housed in one of the buildings. Note that there is a lot to see here but seeing the jewels themselves is a quick viewing. You are not allowed to linger too long. There are many other shining plates, crowns, swords and scepters to see within the building in addition to those with the special placing. Since The Tower is a major tourist attraction, getting here first thing in the morning is highly recommended. If you come later, you will wait in line to get in, and then likely wait in a line to see the Crown Jewels. We bought tickets at the Tower. We were there an hour before the ticket booths opened. By opening, the lines were long but since we were first in line, we moved along quickly. You can also purchase tickets online. As with most major attractions, ladies, your purse will be checked. Definitely worth a visit as long as you get there early. Otherwise, you will waste part of your day with so many other things to see in London and even in this area of London.",Not enough time!
"May 23, 2019",I had booked a tour of the tower for my family but did not realise there was so much to see there. Unfortunately I had planned about 2 hours for this as with teenagers I did not expect them to be totally interested. I was wrong there is so much inside here to see and so much history. The tour with the Yeoman was the highlight and I would recommend getting this tour for a very good insight as they live here full time with their families.,Much ado about nothing 
"May 23, 2019","Like many things in London this place is highly overrated. The best thing is the view of tower bridge you get standing outside. We did at least get one of the “enthusiastic” Beefeaters to do the introduction/opening, which was the best thing inside the walls. The Crown Jewels were ok, until you think about the the privilege and exploitation they represent. Not my cup of tea. ",Always the best to do in London !
"May 22, 2019",Love so much the history and amazing mechanic design of the bridge It’s amazing how does it work in their. In fact I started from engine room as my first stop which was amazing And I am glad I did it the first stop ad it made me understand far better how the bridge work . Wow wow and wow Then good to go up the bridge which got two bridges and glass floor to experience above the bridge even! Glad also with god weather when I. Paired this time. High re moment. Will day number one item to do in London ,Surprising
"May 21, 2019",Not a huge “tour” person but upon entering we were told a Yeoman Warder would be given a tour so we decided to wait and go along. We were not disappointed. The Yeoman was very educated in his history of the tower and pointed out things we never would have noticed on our own. It was worth waiting a few minutes to join the group for the tour and it didn’t cost any extra from entry fee. I would highly recommend being guided by a Yeoman Warder. ,Interesting tour. Excellent guides!
"May 20, 2019","The tour is interesting and full of history. The Beefeaters are excellent and very entertaining. You would not expect this much from a free tour! I would make sure to get in line for the tour rather than just wander around on my own, take the tour and then wander later when you know what you are looking at.",Fascinating example of the layered history of London
"May 20, 2019","This was one of my favourite sites on my trip, although it was an after-thought. Booking online will save you a little bit of money, but you do have to print tickets off or collect at the site. They do not do mobile tickets. I highly recommend the audio tour for the extra money. It gives you enough of an orientation and history of the various parts of the site and in a clear, orderly way. You can read about the various buildings and rooms, but it wouldn’t be as clear which buildings date to which period of history.The Crown Jewels are AMAZING! You cannot take pictures of them, but that keeps the crowds flowing, I think. This is obviously a main attraction for many, so expect to line up. If you don’t see a huge queue already built up, get in line immediately before it does! This will save you a 30-45 minute wait. Either way, it’s worth seeing!If you don’t want to deal with the crowds around Buckingham Palace to see the Queen’s guard, you will get to see them here too, as well as the Beefeaters. Plan on at least 2-3 hours to complete the visit, if you do the audio guide and take the Yeoman Warden tour (included with ticket). This is obviously a popular attraction, so go early, when it opens to avoid the masses. ",Great day out in London.
"May 16, 2019","My son had learnt about the tudors and was intrigued by the history so I took him here. We booked online the day before as it’s cheaper on the day. You need to print your tickets before hand, mobile versions are not accepted. The queue to get in was minimal. We were in after 2 minutes. We went at 11am. There were a lot of tourist groups so we just slipped past them all into more open space. The weather was good to us so we had time to walk around and take in the buildings peacefully. My son really enjoyed seeing all the armoury and weapons and the Crown Jewels. Lots of places to sit down both outside and inside exhibitions. Plenty of staff around, we didn’t need help but they seems friendly and approachable. There was a small shop selling cakes and sandwiches and a larger cafe that we visited. There was an array of food available, hot and cold and plenty of space to sit down and eat inside. I would recommend around 4-5 hours to see everything. My young son wasn’t interested in reading the small print he just wanted to see the artifacts and move on. We were out by 2pm as he had gotten tired and wanted to go home, plus the weather was tiring cloudy and windy. But we did see the Crown Jewels, the white tower, bloody tower, the chapel, the armoury, the ravens, the fusilier museum and the area where Anne Boleyn was executed. I held back when the big groups came through and they all seems to be rushing and pushing through, which I don’t appreciate. We slowly moved through once the rush had moved on. The gift shops sold many times from t shirts, pencils, sweets, feather pens, books to plastic knights swords and helmets. Very reasonably priced. We opted for a souvenir fridge magnet for £5. I’ve visited here a few times before and it still continues to amaze me every time. British history well preserved and at its best. I would recommend visiting in the summer months as it’s right by the river and as there is a lot of walking to be done around the site in summer you can enjoy the sights and the sunshine.",Very Historic
"May 10, 2019","We were in London for a week and staying very close to the tower. We did the tour the last day. We weren’t sure if we should do it because it was 30 pounds at the entrance. So we decided to look on line and were able to get tickets for 24 pounds. Boy we were glad we did !!! It was such a great place to visit. Very historic and so much to see, you think it’s just a boring castle , but when you go in and see it it’s like a whole town in itself. You also get to see the Crown Jewels. Made me want to read more about it. Would definitely recommend seeing this . It’s a once in a life time experience.",Can’t miss while in London
"May 10, 2019",A group of friends and I visited on a rainy London day. Beefeater spoke on the history of the tower in the chapel. Self guided rest of the day. Give yourself 4 hours to see everything. Crown Jewels are amazing. Easy tube ride from wherever you are staying.,Must do!
"May 8, 2019","We spent the better portion of a day at the Tower of London and it was definitely with the price of admission.  We started off with one on the Yeoman tours but the group was simply too big for it to be enjoyable.  We were near the front for the first stop and he was witty and very engaging- but the group was simply too big- as we walked from stop to stop there were times I couldn’t hear or see him- so after the first 3/4 we broke off from the tour and had a great time exploring on our own.  The queue for the crown jewels is Long but it moves steadily and there were costumed actors roaming around enacting skits that made for great entertainment.  The wait is worth it- seeing all of the beautiful jewels and crowns was my favorite part! The various towers, the kitchen and torture room were all awesome we had a great cup of tea and slice of cake in one of the cafes.  There are also several gift shops that have loads of cool souvenirs if you want to shop and an amazing view of Tower Bridge.  I would definitely allocate the better part of a day for this- it’s too much to rush through in just a couple of hours.",Step Back Into Medieval History
"May 3, 2019","In a city awash in history, the Tower of London may be the best place of all to see. Stroll paths walked by kings and villains. See the Crown Jewels. Try climbing the stairs to the top of the White Tower (if you dare). Allow at least three hours to take it all in.",So muc fun
"April 19, 2019","Great place for families, loads of interactive activities for kids with a prize at the end!! There is plenty to see and do for both adults and children.

"April 11, 2019",A wonderful visit and not sure which was my favourite bit. The Beefeaters were spectacular and Spike gave us a lovely chat in the chapel. Crown jewels are stunning and I felt really proud of our history even though it was grim in some places. Give the food a miss and take your own picnic as there are seats to sit on.

"March 31, 2019","No visit to London is complete without a stop at the Tower of London. The history of this place is amazing!! I highly recommend joining one of the Yeoman Guard (beefeater) tours which starts from the moat every 1/2 hour and is included in the entry fee. It was recommended to us by our concierge and the tour truly brought the Tower of London to life. The tours are given by active duty guards and our guard, Lawrence Yates was fantastic. Besides seeing/hearing about all the history, seeing the crown jewels was unreal.",A GREAT TIME
"March 25, 2019","If you can be there quite early (around 10 am), a guide will take a small group and tell everyone stories about this wonderful place, with a lot of humour! visit the white tower, and most of all, feel free to see the crown Jewels!!!",One of the best landmarks in London
"March 19, 2019","Someone told me this is a must when visiting London without spoiling too much and boy was he right. Being able to see to royal crowns, scepters etc from past and present was a delight and that's not to mention the Koh-I-Noor. Definetly worth every penny!",Long day out
"March 17, 2019","We got to the Tower of London at about 12:00 and there was so much to do. We started by going to the Mint which was quite interesting and there was interactive things for younger people to do. We then started in a room which leads you to a sort of one way system where you go around most of the top level of the castle which is different rooms that were used by different people in the past. It wasn’t overly busy and you could easily get into everything we just didn’t have enough time. As we didn’t get to finished the whole tower we are definitely going to go back. There are only 2 negatives, the price of the cafe was rediculous and we were greeted/served by a rude member of staff (Holly) who spoke to us in a rude way. Overall it was a great day and we are looking forward to going back.",Amazing history
"March 11, 2019","I've waited for 35 years to visit the Tower of London and it did not disappoint. The aura of history was everywhere. The buildings were gorgeous. The crown jewels, the white tower, the ravens, the memorial for those beheaded. I will remember them for the rest of my life.",Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly Rocks
"February 20, 2019","I had a personal tour of the Tower and it’s amazing history with the Towers newest and possibly most charismatic Warder, Scott Kelly.  His passion and enthusiasm is so infectious I didn’t want to leave after the tour had finished!Only recently sworn in, it’s obvious he’s in love with the job and as such you get the best experience possible. He personally invests in his audience, ensuring everyone who is fortunate enough to find themselves following will hang on his every word. He also loves a selfie and will pose in front of a camera all day long. If you’re after a memorable photo of yourself and a Beefeater then Scott is your man as he’s nearly as handsome as me, not quite though!!You’ll struggle to have a better time in London than a tour with this loveable rogue.",Huge queue to see the Crown Jewels
"February 18, 2019","The Tower of London is an impressive monument, worth to see it, but we were waiting for about 1 hour in a queue to enter the hall with the Crown Jewels - take care of it especially if the weather is not good!","The White Tower - and the Crown Jewels, too!"
"October 25, 2017","On a recent visit to London, we anticipated long queues, and decided to make the Tower of London our first stop of the day.  We arrived about an hour before the site opened; took some time to photograph the Tower Bridge; and then stood at the entrance in the London Pass queue.  We were among the first to enter, and made a bee line for the Crown Jewels.  We had easy access without waiting, and we got to linger a bit in front of this spectacular bit of British history. The jewels are magnificent to say the least.  The 530 carat Star of Africa diamond cut from the 3100-carat Cullinen is on the great Scepter.  The Koh-i-Nor is on one of the crowns.  It's really a thrill to see some of these legendary jewels and regalia.We also took some time walking the walls of the Tower; we visited the Traitors' Gate; ogled the ravens; and visited the Bloody Tower with its rack.  We saved the White Tower until last, and were rewarded with a stunning display of armor, and a half dozen other interesting exhibits.  I took time at the Tower Green to think about the executions of some of the more famous prisoners of the tower including two of King Henry VIII's wives, Thomas More, and Lady Jane Grey.  It's a chilling feeling to be right where it all happened.I loved arriving at the Tower of London so early in the day.  This move saved us lots of time.  There are a couple of gift shops to visit as well.  I loved the shop just next tot he Jewel House.  Enjoy this must-see site when in London.",Tower of London According to Spike
"October 5, 2017","We took a tour of the Tower of London under the guidance of the venerable Beefeater better known as Spike. The decision to tour the Tower and all it has to offer should be on everyone’s list of things to do when visiting London and you won’t be disappointed.The tour itself is only about an hour in length and anyone can tour the grounds and buildings using the map and other information available on site but the tour with a Beefeater guide is quite the treat.First and foremost you do get a very good explanation about why the Tower was built and the stories about successive Kings, Queens and the intrigue and violence of the Royal Court of the day. More interestingly are the stories and how they relate to to-days world and how history shaped us.Oddly we think of pollution, as a problem of to-day but not so, pollution was a problem several centuries ago. The moat around the Tower was so polluted with raw sewage that it became a significant health hazard and after about 400 years or so the Royalty of the day agreed to have the moat filled in with sand and shells. It became a parade and practice area for the soldiers. The stories of the intrigues of the court and the violence can be felt as the tour progresses.The tour itself ends at and in Chapel Royal of St. Peter ad Vincula where you really learn about the background of the church and the number of people who were beheaded and buried there.Spike himself has quite the vocabulary and challenges people with questions or comments about the history and present day events. There’s a continuous banter, about England and the United States that is very friendly yet laced with a dry wit. Unfortunately there’s nothing mentioned about Canada in the exchange. However this oversight is easily forgotten as soon as Spike moves onto the next subject.In the Chapel Spike did take the time to explain how he became a Beefeater, the requirements and the staunch loyalty to the “Crown”. In fact there is no doubt in his mind that Prince Charles will become the next King. This came, as he was explaining his uniform and the letters and insignia on his uniform. What will the new King call himself? The question is, to be answered at some future time.This is a most highly recommended tour but after that there is still much more to see such as the Royal Jewels with everything from rings, Sceptres, Crowns, Swords etc. Quite a spectacular array.Fortunately there was also a “Food Fest” being held is a large section of the moat so we were also able to sample a large variety of foods and beverages. The Fest itself was not part of the tour but the passes we had gave us access.Overall the major consideration anyone should make is the time required to do the tour with the Beefeater and just walk around the site is time. Don’t be in a hurry, do not think it’s an in and out. You can easily spend 3 to 4 hours visiting and there would still be things to see.Yes, definitely a must see and do when in London.",Get there early
"September 23, 2017","We were told to get there early by friends and this is definitely the case. With gates opening at 9am on the Saturday, we got there at 8.45am. Stood around for a few minutes and then we could start to go in. Being early, there weren't that many people around. We went straight to the Crown Jewels. Walking through, with no pressure of crowds, we could take our time and actually enjoy the experience. We could walk through a couple of times within jumping an queues.Could even get close and personal with guards on duty. Great photo opportunities.The rest of the attraction was easy to navigate and still without too many people around it was a pleasure. As we left around 11.30, you could see the crowds had built considerably.",A must see!
"September 14, 2017","We took a guided tour of the Tower. While I wouldn't recommend that specific tour guide, I think a guided tour could be a good choice of this place, which is quite expansive. There is a lot to see, which could be done in under three hours if you don't mind missing the crown jewels. Otherwise you definitely need more time.",An absolute must!!!!
"September 14, 2017","So much great history explained by the Yeoman who effortlessly guides you through the most important areas.  His tales were beautifully explained with great drama and made the experience very memorable.  Thank you, Steve.....a great story teller.Once inside the grounds inquire about the area to wait for the next guided tour.  The only way to get the real history.  After the tour ends, explore the exhibits on your own.  Something for everyone.  My favorite was seeing the Jewel House.We bought the London Pass which allowed us priority entry.  Also saves money if you are visiting the best London sights.",Highly recommended activity
"September 1, 2017","Our family absolutely loved this tour. My husband and son were not really up on their British history, but they learned a lot and really enjoyed it. There is a lot to see, more than we thought, so this is at least a 1/2 day, if not more, excursion. I recommend waiting for the tour guide as they really add to it (especially our tour guide, he was fantastic, but sadly can't remember his name). There is a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes. We did not eat on site, but you are there a long time so eat in advance or take snacks (the onsite ice cream is wonderful). It is quite near the Tube station which makes it very convenient.",London visit
"July 13, 2017",Great place to visit. Such a rich history. It has everything for a complete family visit. Something to interest each member of the family. Crown jewels display is awesome. So is the armory. The guides ( royal wardens) are awesome.,Must visit
"July 12, 2017","This is a must visit tourist location and is a place covered by the London Pass.Get there early so you have enough time  to see everything.   When you enter, just past security on your left you'll see a small sign indicating when the next Yeoman tour will start- make sure you allow time to go on this tour.  The Yeomen (Beefeaters) are hysterical and knowledgeable and you'll have a great time learning about The Tower of London.   It's free.  Get in line to see the Crown Jewels even if you think you have zero interest in them- they're really cool and there's other things to see.  You're there anyway so go.In the building across from the jewels are armor and weapons displays.  Again,even if you think you have zero interest go.  The craftsmanship is amazing.The torture room is a huge let down. One small room with a rack.  That's it.  The line moves quickly so if you want to see the device, get in line.There are a few reinactments going on throughout the day- I suggest getting to the exhibits first and walking through the tower rooms and if you happen upon a the actors doing something, stop a moment and watch.This attraction should take about 3 hours- maybe longer depending on lines and how long you spend reading and looking at the displays.",Fantastic day out for all
"July 5, 2017","Five tips for a great day out with children or without - 1. GO EARLY!!! Especially if you are going with children. You won't regret getting up early when you see how much time you'll save. Book your tickets in advance and ideally have them sent to you before you go as even the pre-booked ticket queue builds up before opening time. If you have tickets to collect aim to be there 20 minutes before opening time. DON'T wait until the day before buying tickets and be there before opening time as queues develop very quickly.2. Do the Crown Jewels FIRST. Head straight to the centre of the Tower area and do this as you will be able to see more, spend more time on it and queue for a tiny fraction of the time compared to those who go later in the day. 3. Do the Yeoman Warden tour second. Head back towards the entrance and pick up one of the regular tours (included in entrance fee). Our YW was hilarious, knowledgeable and entertaining throughout and our children loved him. Not the dry boring experience they might have thought. Thanks to YW Thynne!!!4. Buy a guide book (not the children's one). It's great value, has excellent content and will enrich your experience.5. Be prepared to spend all day here. We spent 6 hours and it wasn't too long and not one minute was boring. Our children (11 and 9) were really engaged the whole time between the tour, Crown Jewels, towers, wall walk, ravens, museums and re-enactments (this last thing being put on for the kids and is again funny and educational at the same time).","That was nice place for visiting, also knights were amazing !"
"July 2, 2017","That was nice place for visiting, also knights were amazing ! Weapon room was very attractive and also jewelry room.",A Must See in London
"April 10, 2017","This was a wonderful and fascinating place to visit.  Our family loved it  DO NOT MISS THE free BEEFEATER Tour.  Lawrence was amazing.  Seriously, do not skip the Beefeater Tour.  ",Fascinating London History for All Ages...
"April 7, 2017","The Tower of London is a major attraction and has something to offer almost everyone. We had a limited amount of time and chose to take a self guided tour rather than the Warder's Tour. We spent about 2 hours wandering through the massive fortress and there is plenty to see. Not only is the fortress structure impressive, there are many great exhibits. Of course the Crown Jewels are not to be missed but the armor and weapons rooms are also real treats. The view of the Tower Bridge is spectacular and favorite photo spot.",Fabulous experience
"March 22, 2017","How lucky are we in the uk to have some amazing history to go and visit. We visited this amazing place with our kids a few years back but decided we missed most of what interested us. We had a fabulous guide by the name of Spike and his knowledge was 2nd to none with a brilliant talent to entertain as well. I love our countries history and never realised what we have here. Standing in the chapel inside the grounds of the tower amongst over 1500 buried famous people including Anne Boleyn, bought tears to my eyes and goose pimples everywhere. A brilliant display of weapons, amour, the crown jewels, ravens, and much much more, if your any where near you must visit and ask for a tour with Spike, great bloke and a gentleman. Thank you for a great day",So Many Laughs / So Much History
"March 16, 2017","I had never done the Tower of London tour and wasn't quite sure what to expect.  Let's just say, this was by far one of my most favorite tours ever.  The Beefeater, Mark, was a riot.  He shared history as well as humor.  If in London, you must visit The Tower of London.",Overpriced!
"March 13, 2017",Ended up not going in due to the price!   Travelling with my mum (78) we planned the London trip to include a visit to see the crown jewels but after getting there and being told 1 adult and 1 concession was £50 we walked away.  Outrageously expensive!  ,"Book ticket online in advance, & go in the morning when it opens"
"January 26, 2017","I've been to London a few times, have never been to ToL, till last visit back in October last year.  I was a bit hesitant, that it may be over crowded, & over touristy.  Yes, it's a bit touristy, & can be very crowded, but IMO, it definitely worthy of a visit, esp. If you are visiting from overseas.  It's not fair to rate this place a 3- star, when one did not get in to visit, because of crowds & expenses; it's not even fair or objective to rate when rather did not get to visit a place in depth.  My recommendation is to book your ticket in advance before your trip, you will receive your ticket by mail.  I got my before heading to London, & I went first thing in the morning in a nice cool sunny day, I was able to get into CoJ without any crowds or waits, I was able to take my time to truly appreciate what they have to offer. There are many points of interests inside ToL,  one could really spend at least 1/2 day there.  That's what I did, it got quite crowded when I was ready to leave at 1PM, with many large groups.  Research, learn & plan ahead, you will enjoy your visist, no only limited to this massive attraction.",Fantastic family trip out!
"January 14, 2017",Our kids (& us) loved the Tower of London. We went on one of the tours by the Yeomans - Yeoman Dave. He was fabulous so many people on the tour but no issues hearing him at all. The kids LOVED all the history and hearing about the gory details of executions! (kids aged 7 & 9). We were there for 3 hours but could have spent much longer we didn't see everything we wanted but ran out of time sadly. We will go back next trip again.,Amazing place and fantastic tour
"January 3, 2017","We booked online the morning of our visit and saved a little money and a lot of time. Doing this you skip the long ticket lines. We hooked up with a tour from a Yeoman Warder (""Beefeater Dave"") which was great. The tour was fascinating, appropriately long, and free with entry. The crown jewels are definitely worth getting in line to see. The White Tower is pretty good. Lots of armor. ",Must See -- Requires a Half-Day at Least
"January 2, 2017","This is one of the three ""not-free but must see"" attractions in London, along with St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey. Plan on several hours to explore the complex completely.",Make sure to take a Beefeater Tour!
"December 29, 2016","*Thank you Clive for an amazing tour!*Visited with my wife and cousin. Arrived before 10am, so we were near the front of the queue to obtain our tickets (we ordered online, but the 'vouchers' needed to be exchanged for actual tickets). We were surprised by the sheer amount of other tourists who arrived for opening time. The queue to actually get in to the Tower was very long, but moved very quickly (walking pace).We missed the first Beefeater tour, so we explored the Tower grounds on our own. Toilets were quite a trek away. Saw the Bloody Tower - very interesting, as well as the Crown Jewels. The Crown Jewels are in an exhibit case, with a moving walkway on both sides (like a conveyer belt), which kept people moving along, and prevented having to battle through a large crowd of people to see them. Really interesting exhibits with a lot of interesting information.The surprising highlight of our visit, though, was the Beefeater Tour. The ""Beefeater"" we saw was a guy named Clive. He was full of really interesting information and stories, and really brought things to life. He was very entertaining and enthusiastic.I won't spoil things for you by telling you some of the things we learnt, but it was all so memorable. Really, really captivating and enthralling. So glad we went on the Beefeater Tour, and that we stayed for the whole thing (took about an hour).It was a little bit chilly this time of year (Dec 2016), but coming from Canada it felt balmy to us! A lot of the other tourists were dressed in hats and scarves and thick coats. Especially if you go on one of the Beefeater Tours, there's a lot of standing around.Got to witness one of the parades to the chapel, which was pretty cool. All staff and other Beefeaters on site were very friendly, helpful and approachable.See if you can spot the ravens!To get the most out of the experience you will probably need to be mobile. The Bloody Tower had a long set of narrow, twisting stairs. There's a lot of walking around on uneven cobblestone paths. The historic ambience of the Tower was a tad ruined by the introduction of an ice-rink (with loud thumping music) near the front gates.",How to truly do the Tower.
"March 28, 2015","If you want to do the Tower of London, here is how you do it properly. Buy tickets on-line, This way when it opens at 10 am, you avoid the lines at ticket counter and walk straight onto the sight of the Tower. Make your way to the crown jewels right away. Once you have looked at the crown jewels come back to the entrance to find the next Beefeater giving a tour. These guys will take you around and give you loads of info about the history of their residence (yes, they live there!). After you have toured with the Beefeater, then walk around in the various buildings at your own pace. You will notice the line with an hour wait at the crown jewels and say to yourself ""thank goodness we did that first!"". You can also get a nice lunch on site but if you come out there are many restaurants right at the exit of the Tower. Enjoy!",Definitely go!  Here's how. 
"March 24, 2015","I don't do crowds or lines. So here's how to avoid them:  purchase your tickets ahead of time on-line, print out the email voucher that is sent to you and bring it with you on the day of the visit. Arrive just before they open. Go to the Group ticket line and pick up your tickets. Head inside the London Tower and go straight to the Jewels. See that first and then return toward the entrance for the Beefeater tour. Well worth it. Then simply enjoy the other parts of the Tower at your own pace. No better way to do it!",Fascinating Day
"February 18, 2015","We were fortunate to go to the Tower of London this August right after they had placed the poppies in memory of the 100 year anniversary of  WWI.  The tower is fascinating place, make sure you go on a Beefeater tour.   They are informative and entertaining.  It will take you most of the day to see everything and the line for the crown jewels looks long but moves along and it is worth the wait.",Such a let down for such a fantastic historical sight
"January 26, 2015","I am really interested in Tudor history, particularly Anne Boleyn so I was so excited to be going to the Tower of London to see for myself the place where so many amazing things happened in history. I was however really disappointed at the poor effort curation and research that I saw. The main 2 attractions are the Crown Jewels for which there was a 2 hr queue when we went so we skipped them as I was more interested in the history of the place than that part anyway, and the 2nd big event there is the exhibition of the great exhibition they have had there for 300 years. They put a lot of effort into an exhibition about this exhibition which was primarily wooden horses and armour from various monarchs. Instead of giving you information about the armour or the monarch who wore them you get lots of detail about the exhibition itself which is not nearly as interesting. Around the whole site there are 2 or 3 mentions of Anne Boleyn and her location when she was kept in the tower was not known. Most disappointing was the Bloody Tower for which we queued to get in and saw 3 boards with some vague information about the princes in the tower and a projection of a film from the 1970s about Richard III. I really wanted to go there and be able to imagine what it was like to have been kept there or to have stayed in the royal palace. I'd like to have learned something new and really felt the history in the place but instead I felt like things had been put together with minimum effort and barely any research. I was quite upset having been so looking forward to going and having paid so much for a ticket. Honestly you get as much from going and walking around the outside as you do from paying to get in. They need to hire new curators and make the history come to life as it is such a waste as it is. ",Excellent Guided Tour of the Tower
"November 10, 2014","We paid for a guided tour and a very jovial and friendly Yeoman Warder or ""Beefeater"" guided our group through the Tower. The Crown Jewels were fantastic as you could view them all up close. The chapel, traitors gate...all very good to see and hear from the Yeoman Warder about the history behind it all.",Remembrance Poppies - a once in a lifetime experience
"November 10, 2014","Moving, touching, thought-provoking and poignant. Visited on Remembrance Sunday along with countless tens of thousands more - the traffic was horrendous but our discomfort doesn't compare with their sacrifice. Thank you all ... We will remember.",The Sea of Poppies
"November 9, 2014","I cannot say enough about the impact the Sea of Poppies had on me. To realize that over 888,000 British soldiers died in the Great War and that there was one poppy planted for each is just an incredibly moving tribute to their ultimate sacrifice. It is a truly humbling and overwhelming sight. Remember the fallen.",Wonderful
"November 8, 2014","The ceramic red poppies were a wonderful moving sight, the papers and TV don't do it justice. Yes, it was crowded but there was security in place showing you where to go and people were moving on  so you could get a lovely view. Well worth a visit",WW1 poppy remembrance outstanding
"November 8, 2014","Possibly one of the most humbling experiences. Really glad we took the kids to see the poppies before they disappear. Can't suggest strongly enough to visit. Crowds very busy, but worth the trip",Poppies
"November 6, 2014","Beautiful act of remembrance, so glad we visited, best to go early to avoid the crowds, we arrived at 815am",Poor use made of a great historical building
"August 15, 2015","This magnificent building promised a great deal from the outside. You expect history to be retold with displays, vignettes,etc. instead what do you get. A beefeater shouting a little history, costumed 'actors' re-enacting some historical event which nobody could hear. The Tower was half full of armour with only a small attempt at engaging the paying public. The queue for Crown Jewels snaked around too far, at this point we decided to leave. It's about time the owners got their act together. Maybe a visit to Williamburg Virginia should be undertaken (at their own expense) where history was presented with enthusiasm, colourful, friendly and clear. I did not need to told that funding was tight, it will remain even tighter if the product is badly sold. Get your act together, stop blaming and get working.",Go early and follow a Beefeater
"August 5, 2015","The tower has a ton to offer for the history nut or casual tourist. You'll see so much of Britain's history here in one concentrated area. Two things I will mention. Go early and do the beefeater tour. The later it gets on in the day, the more people pack in and the slower everything gets. Especially the Crown Jewels. We breezed through that and by the time we left there was a two hour line. That and everywhere else became moving herds rather quickly. The Beefeater tours look like a tourist trap. They're not. These guys are legit. They're animated, full of passion for what they do, and know everything there is to know about the tower. Your whole experience will be miles better if you take advantage of their contribution rather than just walk the grounds yourself aimlessly. Their tour will give you background on everything and then you can gravitate towards what interests you most with more context.",Tourist Trap
"July 17, 2015","I lived in central London for six months and can confidently say that there is no greater waste of money than visiting the Tower of London. Much of what can be seen at the Tower is either a cheap recreation or can be seen for free elsewhere in London. For example, the ""torture chamber"" portion of the Tower is simply a small room full of modern replicates of medieval torture devices and is altogether uninteresting. The other rooms and exhibits in the Tower of London are not much different from what you can find in any of the myriad of castles around the UK.  History buffs may take a great interest in visiting here and may even be able to justify the cost, but for the average traveler, I would say that your money is best spent elsewhere. ",Not worth the price!
"July 11, 2015","My sisters and our dad took a trip to the Tower of London during the Christmas time. I first was reluctant to go because of the high ticket prices (even for children). We still ended up going. The line going in wasn't that bad, but as soon as we went in (mostly just to see the Crown Jewel) we found out that the waiting time to see the Crown Jewel was 2+ hours. Other exhibits had similar waiting times too. We then went to see the amour exhibit, but that too was people squished right next to each other. There was no space for actually browsing around. After 15 minutes of trying to find the exit, we exited and decided not to go anywhere else in the Tower of London. I would say unless you have a lot of time to spare, the ticket price is not worth it.",Loved It!
"July 9, 2015","Wonderful Experience!  Here are my need to know tips:Before you go:*Go online and secure ""Ceremony of the Keys"" tickets.  One of the coolest ceremonies I've been to. *Go on you-tube to see Yeoman warder tour.  I've got small kids and miss most of what is said on tours, getting the tour a head of time gives me the information if I miss it. Also hearing it twice you might actually understand what is being said or look up what you don't understand. (1) Get the London Pass, as there is a separate line for London Pass holders(2) Get there when it opens(3) Go to the Jewel house first, que up and see the jewels.  Lines get long! (4) Go back for the Yeoman Warder Tour (given every hour) - if it's raining they take you to the church, not as excitingLoved every moment!  Hope you do too!",A great day out but long queues
"July 2, 2015",A great experience and it was fascinating to see the Crown Jewels . The queues did spoil it a bit but the beefeaters were very informative and kept us entertained,A Marvel
"June 29, 2015",Well worth every single penny. You need at least 5 hours if you want to see everything. Ifyyou want to see the crown jewels just go early to avoid queues.,Arrive early
"June 26, 2015","Here are a few tips for enjoying one of London's most iconic and interesting historic locations:1. Purchase tickets in advance. It is easy to purchase tickets online, in advance and have them mailed to your home - even if you live outside England. 2. Arrive early. We arrived just before the gates opened at 9 AM and were among the first visitors into the Tower of London. We immediately went to view the Crown Jewels. Along with only a handful of people, we were able to spend considerable time admiring the royal treasures. By midday the line was enormous, but early in the morning there is no line.3. Eat early. There is a very good and reasonably priced cafeteria on the premises. At 11:30 AM there is no line and we enjoyed an early lunch in relative quiet. 4. Take the Beefeaters Tour. What we appreciated most about the Yeoman who led our tour was his genuine pride in England's history. He was approachable and humorous and helped us appreciate the remarkable history we were seeing.",Definitely do the Yeoman Warder Tour!
"May 24, 2015",The Tower of London was a wonderful tourist destination. We took the Yeoman Warder Tour and the information was astonishing. It was a first hand account of from the men who have lived there for hundreds of years and it was FREE! The Crown Jewels were fabulous!,Must See Attraction
"May 21, 2015","So, in my opinion here are the Must Do's at the biggest (besides the National Gallery) Must See attraction in London.1) Get there early...10-15 minutes before opening on a weekday (8:45) is probably enough even if you don't have a London Pass (highly recommended though).  We were the 2nd couple in line.2)  Go immediately to the Jewel House...We were the 1st people in there.  The moving conveyor sidewalk wasn't on and we had 15 minutes of being the only tourists there.  After your 15 minutes of silent contemplation, go over to the guard and ask as many questions as you want...they have some fascinating stories.3)  About 9:50...wander back to the entrance and find the Beefeater there and take the 1st tour.  This was educational and amusing.  Our guide was very funny!  You will learn the history of the Tower, hear some grisly stories, learn about how to become a Beefeater, and even meet a crow!  Tour took an hour and should not be missed.4)  Next go to the top of the wall and do the walk...Wonderful views inside and out.5)  Finally take a tour of the White Tower....especially the Armor Museum.That took us about 3 hours...You could easily spend 2-3 hours more but definitely plan on a 9-12 visit.  Kids of all ages love this place.  My wife and I are 60...we loved it too!",We will never forget
"November 6, 2014","The Tower of London is great at any time but this year it's a bit special with nearly 900 thousand Poppy's in the moat to remember the fallen of the First World War, I took a 3 hour stroll around the Site to say it was beautiful  is an understatement but it made one think having found out our family lost two family members in the conflict.Get to see them before they go and they become a memory.",Worth it!
"October 31, 2014","We planed to spend half a day here-- and spent the whole day instead! There is just so much to see here. We started with a tour guided by one of the yeomen warders-- a great way to start. Then spent the rest of the day exploring the area on our own. We were lucky enough to visit during the art installation for the 100th anniversary of WWI, and the moat around the tower was full of ceramic poppies-- stunning.The Crown Jewels were, of course, amazing to see, but expect to wait in line for the chance. We only waited about 10-15 minutes to enter the exhibit, but I would imagine that wait is much longer in the summer.It seems there is something to see in every inch of the Tower of London. Oh, and the ravens were interesting too!There are several souvenir shops and little cafés around, so if you are feeling peckish or need retail therapy you can do that too.",Unmanaged crowds are dangerous
"October 31, 2014","My wife and I bought a £59 family ticket online to take our grandchildren (aged 8 and 5). The visit was an immense disappointment and actually quite dangerous.Crowd control and queue management was absolute disgrace. The difficulty began from arrival at Tower Hill tube station - not the Tower's responsibility I accept - and continued outside the Tower, with an immense crush of people milling around, many not knowing where they were going, pressing through queues, some jumping queues or inadvertently starting new queues, tripping over children and buggies, becoming angry etc. etc. Staff seemed entirely absent with the only advice coming from the service people selling poppies. It was quite frightening and any sort of incident would have produced injuries very quickly.If we hadn't already of paid for our ticket we would have gone home right away.We did eventually manage to get into the Tower and found movement inside almost as difficult. There were extremely long queues for everything (including the cafe, the Crown Jewels and the Armoury), crushes in the Bloody Tower, Medieval Palace and the wall walk. Once again the very long queues were completely mismanaged with people having difficulty passing through them to get anywhere, people arguing and finding they'd been standing in the wrong queue and tension very high. Once again, the situation was extremely dangerous; especially so for children.The Yeoman Warder tours and talks - which I have found added an exciting feature in the past - were simply impossible to hear due to the crowds. It became clear that we were not going to be able to queue safely for that length of time with the children and after visiting the toilets (which were thankfully OK) and the shop to spend about £30 on souvenirs, we went home; once again negotiating dangerous and unmanaged crowds on the way out..The Tower of London has always been important to me. My father took me there in the 1950s and I took my children there in the 1980s. It is part of my history and heritage. Visiting inspired me to read and study history and politics. Yesterday's visit was an immense and expensive, dangerous and upsetting disappointment.I understand that it was Poppy Day and that the poppies in the moat have become a tourist attraction in themselves (we could hardly glimpse them) but it is plain that there is going to be a serious tragedy at the Tower of London unless the crowds are brought under control. A serious warning on the website might be advised but there is nothing.My sad conclusion is that you should avoid visiting the Tower of London unless you go in 1957",Poppies
"October 23, 2014",I went to the tower just to see the poppies I was not disappointed The display is absolutely magnificent and well worth a trip just to see it It was very very busy but the number of people viewing the poppies only added to the enormity of the art work It was very moving. We didn't go into the tower itself but even so we spent a good two hours just walking around the moat looking at the poppies. I highly recommend this,Sea of Poppies Blood Swept and Tears
"October 21, 2014",Very privileged to be part of the voluntary team on Saturday that planted the Ceramic Poppies It was wonderful to see all the visitors showing such an interest Having viewed the Poppies from above with all the spectators it really is breathtaking Please go and see this at the Tower of London then stay for the last post as the roll of honour is read out .... Very moving What a wonderful tribute .......,Tower of London
"October 20, 2014","My wife & I used Tesco vouchers on Friday 17th October worth £30 so only had to pay another £10 to get in. Almost immediately we got inside at around 11am, a good crowd had gathered and were laughing away as Beefeater MARK, I believe, (pics to follow) was beginning his entertaining and amusing walking tour of the Tower. The Byward Tower was first and then the Bell Tower and Traitors Gate. Mark constantly kept the crowd informed, spellbound and laughing with his special brand of storytelling. St Thomas's Tower followed and then the awful story of the Princes in the Blood Tower. Now were outside The Chapel of St Peter & Vincula, where Mark pointed out a nearby spot where amongst others, Anne Boleyn had lost her life in a beheading. Inside we went and it was very solemn (no cameras/pics/phones) as Mark very movingly told the story of the death of Anne Boleyn (a tear ran down my face) - 3 queens of England, Anne B, Catherine Howard and Jane Grey, and two saints of the Roman Catholic Church, Sir Thomas More and John Fisher, are also buried here. Here the tour ended on a higher note with applause and smiling faces as we exited the Chapel. So much more to see, including the Crown Jewels in a new setting created in 2012 by De Beers, The Armoury including Henry the 8th body and horse armour (note the H&K for Katherine on his armour skirt (see pic). We were lucky to have also seen the amazing Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red in which teams of volunteers are installing 888, 246 handmade poppies to mark the death of each member of the British Forces in the 1st World War. 5 hours very well spent absorbing 800 odd years of history. Admittedly not very user friendly for wheelchair users or buggies due to the age and sheer volume of stairs in the Tower.",Gorgeous Poppies
"October 18, 2014","Hurry quick to see the gorgeous red poppies outside commemorating almost 900,000 military deaths in WWI.  It is beautiful. The crown jewels were the best part - simply amazing.  Could easily spend the entire day here with so much history to soak in.",poppy display
"October 18, 2014","Excellent, don't need to pay to see it. Plenty of room to enjoy the view. Walked along the embankment to get there which was lovely.",Sea of Poppies - so moving.
"October 18, 2014","The sea of poppies at The Tower of London are amazing. We went at 17.45. We saw all the poppies and then at about 18. 10 a beefeater and a guardsman marched to the mound. The beefeater solemnly read out the names and ranks of quite a few of the men who gave their lives for king and country during World War One. After this the guard played The Last Post. Every one stood in silence as a show of respect - so moving. The whole thing made me weepy at the thought of such a loss of so many young men and women, and that was just from Britain and the Commonwealth. How anymore thousands from around the world died and how many more suffered for the rest of their lives?",Poppies!
"October 17, 2014","If you're in London until November, don't miss a trip to the Tower to view the ceramic poppies commemorating WWI.  There is  a poppy for every British soldier killed during WWI.  It's a breathtaking, but sobering sight to behold.  You don't need a ticket to view the poppies.  ",A Blast from the Past
"October 12, 2014","Followed tips by fellow TA advisors and got there when it opened.  If you do this, there is no need to buy skip the line or special passes.  We headed right for the crown jewels and were able to make a number of passes before it got crowded. After visiting the White Tower, we headed back out to the main gate for the Beefeater Tour.  Our guide was a retired army Sgt-Major who provided lots of interesting anecdotes with a humorous twist.  Allow about three hours to get a good feel for the place.",Poppies
"October 12, 2014",went today to see the First World War poppies installation .So very moving .What a fantastic experience 888246 beautiful ceramic red poppies free to view from outside the Tower of London .How ever had this idea deserves a medal  well done who ever you are  and thank you for this experience,Fantastic!
"October 11, 2014","My husband and I travelled to London today on an organised coach trip to the Tower of London... mainly because I wanted to see the Poppies.  We were so lucky that the sun shone all day apart from a short shower at lunchtime.  We hadn't been to the Tower for abouit 25 years so it was good to re-visit and see the (amazingly clean) historic buildings again.The highlight of course is the stunning display of ceramic poppies which can be seen without actually paying the admission fee to the Tower.  When the sun shone on the poppies they sparkled.It was tear-jerking to remember that each poppy represents someone who died in WWI, and inspiring to watch the many thousands of visitors taking pictures and paying their respect.",The poppys of remembrance - stunning and moving
"October 9, 2014","Wednesday 8th October, we made a rare visit to London, even though we live in Surbiton.  Once we had completed what needed doing we decided to visit some of the sights, one of the things we agreed we would like to visit was the Tower of London to see the poppys of remembrance. The display is know as Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red.The moat surrounding the Tower was full of the ceramic poppys, a sea of red, with some of the poppys down the wall of the Tower, almost like blood trickling down the wall into the sea below. It is so amazing, thought provoking,  emotional and a fitting tribute - 100 years World War 1. There are over 888,000 poppys representing the fallen.The poppys will be on display until 11th November,  so not there for much longer. This is so worth seeing. Congratulations to the Designers, Organisers and Planners of this poignant spectacle it is amazing.There is no fee to view the poppys.",Take the Beefeater tour ...
"September 3, 2014","The Tower of London for its historical value is probably a 3+ walk around ... but the Beefeater tour is hilarious, fun, and educational ... making the visit to Tower of London a 5 rating!",Horrible Histories bought to life!
"September 3, 2014","Had a Fab family day out here. We were going to go to Madame Tussaurds but were put off by the reviews about how busy it is at this time of year. We definitely made the right choice!We were lucky enough to get a tour from a Yeoman (Beefeater) called Mark, he was fantastic and bought all the grisly stories to life. Even our children were hanging off every word. The que for the crown jewels looked enormous, I joined the end which was down by the café at 2:30 by 2:55 we were inside the que was very fast moving so please don't be put off by the length of it.A great day out well worth the entrance fee (which is cheaper if bought online)The poppies are overwhelming they still have another 500,000 to lay. its very sobering when you think each one represents a life lost!",Poppies and the Last Post
"August 24, 2014","I strongly recommend trying to catch the planting of the Poppies in the Moat of the Tower of London. Equally Moving is the Last Post, where they are reading out some of the names of the Dead from world War One, from the middle of the field of poppies at sunset. The Poppies are amazing, since they are ceramic, one for each person who died during the war.This is only on until the end of the year.",Disappointing -- except for the Crown Jewels
"August 22, 2014","This was far and away the most disappointing attraction of anything we visited during our week's stay in London.  Price was a touch high -- and then, when you're through the gate -- we learn we have to pay AGAIN for an audio tour (which was, I think the only place we toured where this double-take was the case). To make matters worse, the audio is the most discombobulated.  Rather than have options for site 1, 2, etc. (which usually would be marked), as most tours did, this one apparently HAD to be done in order -- and woe to those (like us) who didn't want to see things in the order specified.   We finally just turned it off and walked around where we wanted to.   It seemed to us that they also wanted to avoid explaining the main thing the tower had been about -- i.e., a prison and place for some executions.   The only thing to spare this from being even more awful was the crown jewels.  They were truly exquisite.    The audio tour people need to take a page from Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace, both of which had EXCELLENT audio tours, with the price INCLUDED in the admission.  This desperately needs to be reworked.",Incredible display
"August 15, 2014",I went to Tower of London to see the WW1 poppy display in the moat. It is beautiful in a sad way . Am arranging to come back to London beginning November to see the completed display . My advice don't miss it . Go now go November but go its worth it,One of London's Well Kept Heritage
"August 10, 2014","Go early in the morning to avoid crowd and once you pass the main arch after the security check  , there is a clock that indicate the next tour conducted by a costumed Beefeater. My previous  tour with one of the Beefeater was hillarious and interesting. Unlike other attraction where audio guide is included with the entrance ticket, the audio guide here had to be paid for separately. Besides, the grim history of this fortress you will be able to see the ongoing exhibition of the Crown Jewel and Royal Armouries. Definitly a attraction that worth your time.",spent 4hours there and still didn't see everything
"September 12, 2011","We had bought tickets online in advance. There wasn't much of a line to get tickets or get in but it was nice to have a backup incase it was busy. We were able to take the tube directly to the tower as there is a 'tower' stop right across the street.  Checkout the old roman wall outside the subway station and another excavation on the pedestrian walk way on the way to the tower. There was a yeoman tour guide ahead of us so we joined that group instead of waiting 20mins for the next one. Our guide was humorous and informative. He led us into the inside of the keep and ended at the chapel. No pictures in the chapel, but make sure to check out the tomb markers at the front alter where Lady Jane Grey is as well as some other notables. The Normal 'white castle' was fun to see, it had large exhibits in the main rooms and smaller views of every day life in others. If you are claustrophobic some of the winding stairs and hall ways can be tight, but it's worth a look around. We visited the crown jewels right around lunch time so the line was shorter and moved quickly. I was surprised that there's a moving sidewalk to get you by the crown jewels, but i guess they don't want people looking too long and clogging up the cue. Beautiful stuff, not a very long exhibit but worth a look. we had lunch in the Tower Cafe. they had a good variety of pre-made sandwiches and chips as well as some really good baked goods, hot plate options like fish n chips and brisket. Make sure to pick up a raspberry tart, it was about the best thing i'd had all week, my husband had the Victoria cake and he said he wished he had gotten my tart. We exited on the river side where there are fantastic views of the Tower Bridge (aka: London bridge). Great opportunity to walk over and take a closer look. well worth the time, i didn't expect to be there more than 2hours but we were there for about 4hrs, so give yourself lots of time.",Fun Times at the Tower
"September 3, 2011","We went to the Tower of London--- it was crowded but SO FUN and INTERESTING. Take the time to do the tour with one of the ""Beefeaters"" (Yeoman Warders). Ours was so informative and FUNNY. Doesn't matter how large the group is; these fellows can really belt out the information (you almost feel the need to stand at attention out of respect). We viewed the Crown Jewels, toured the central White Tower, took a break at the cafe (which BTW, was managed VERY PROFESSIONALLY), took a walk around the outer wall, and viewed the Fusilier Museum.... we didn't intend to, but we spent 5 HOURS at the Tower! GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!",Awesome Place to Visit
"August 26, 2011","My wife and I visite the Tower of London in March of 2011.  I have been before during the Christmas season and it was much more crowded.  The weather wasnt great, but March is probably the best time to go because there aren't nearly as many tourists as there would be in the summer.  Make sure you take the guided tour that is free and given by one of the Yeomen.  They know just about everything there is to know about the Tower and you'll learn things you would otherwise miss by going around on your own.",Super interesting
"August 26, 2011","The Tower was very interesting. Although the guided tours were that large that you couldn't really hear the guides. I  bought a book about the tower, so that we could tour it by ourselves and read the information.We didn't make it to the jewelry room, because we were heading to a concert in the evening. I would recomend to go to the jewelry room first thing in the morning, because the lines build up true the day.I really enjoyed the tour, and would take it again, on my next visit. There is alot of things to see that have to do with the Tudors. I watch the show Tudors on TV, so I found it particularly interting to know about that epoche. Everybody who saw the show can easily understand what happened there. It was amazing to see all those rooms where those kings really lived. And the armour collecting is really great. They even have childrens armours, which I didn't even knew existed.",Arrive early and see Crown Jewels first
"August 25, 2011",The key to a great visit to the Tower of London is to arrive early and see the Crown Jewels before the crowds get too large.We went in early August on a Saturday. I had pre-booked tickets the night before on line to save a few pounds. I planned to arrive at 9AM but we didn't get there until 10AM. The crowds actually were not as bad as I expected. However by lunch time it was packed.,Tower of London - and other sites - on the cheap
"July 29, 2011","Went to the Tower Area yesterday with grandson via C2C rail line from Essex. Train line goes via Fenchurch street to Essex coast. Went online to C2C and as long as you can show 2 train tickets you can get a raft of 2 for 1 entrance offers to the Tower and lots and lots of top London Attractions. I bought tickets from LimeHouse to Fenchurch Street only (1 stop). I got a cheap ticket for me and only paid £1 for grandson's off peak child which saved a LOT of entrance money on our visit to the Tower and Churchill's WW2 Museum at London Bridge.The other cheapo tip I have for visiting the Tower is to NOT go inside if you have a large group. It is VERY expensive for a family to visit (2011 prices adult £19.80, child £10.85) and unless you are mad keen to see where people's heads got chopped off you may not think it's worth the entrance. ALL of the Royal Armaments from the Tower are no longer there but are in Leeds (a VERY long way from London). Also all we saw of the Crown Jewels were pictures and videos. Just walk around the perimeter, take as many photos as you can of the outside walls including gates where the Beefeaters stand. Believe me, most people will never know from your photo's you have NOT been inside the walls. Also in the summer months, there are usually Jousts held in the old moat area on the outside of the walls. These also are free to watch and take pictures of.",Excellent Slice of History!
"June 22, 2011","What a treat to see the Ceremony of the Keys last December! Every night for at least 700 years, the ceremony has taken place at exactly 9:53 PM. Tickets are free, but you must request them in advance by post. A word of warning, however - the ceremony is indeed carried out my members of the Tower of London Guard and they do not suffer fools. You will be escorted out if you can't keep from yapping! Witnessing the Tower lock-up is a fantastic way to end a day of London sightseeing and I couldn't recommend it more highly!",Great way to know British history
"June 12, 2011","First thing: book tickets online; that entitles you to a discount.  Also, a ticket is valid for 1 week from the date mentioned.  So if you have to make your own itinerary, this flexiticket is a boon.  Instead of taking a bus tour of London or a hop off hop on tour, you can save money by doing a free walking tour of London and using a traval card/oyster card get down at Tower Hill tube station and make your way to the Welcome Centre to get the ticket vouchers in exchange of your online tickets.  It is best to come early morning when most tourists are at the Buckingham Palace to see the Change of Guards (1130 hours).  You can avail of the Yeoman's Warder tour which gives you a hang of the Tower and all the history and gore associated with it.  You should then make your way to see the Crown Jewels.  If you have the energy, you can then see the White Tower (if you are interested in the various armours and weapons used by the royals of yore) and the Medieval Palace and take a walk along the walls of the Tower.  It can take up to 4-5 hours if you really want to see the Tower in detail; if you are short of time, take the Yeoman Warder tour followed by a visit to the Crown Jewels followed by a walk along the walls of the Tower.  This attraction is a must see if you are in London",The must-see attraction in London
"May 19, 2011","When in London, you must stop and spend a half day at the Tower of London, it will be well worth it. Just after getting in, there are free tours leaving from the entrance led by a Yeoman Warder that take 1 hour and give you a good idea of the history of the Tower. These guides are humourous and knowledgable so take advantage of that.There is a lot to see, the crown jewels are amazing although the line to get to see them can be very long. On a Friday late morning, it wasn't too long.  The Tower itself has a lot to see inside but there a lot of stairs to climb both up and down so it can be tiring. There is a large gift shop in the basement of the tower. The walk aloong the walls has some great views of London. I recommend the cafetria for lunch, wasn't that expensive and had a good selection. The only thing that disappointed was the torture chamber as nothing really to see in there. My kids were rather disappointed in that part. A tip is to buy your tickets online and then pick them up at the ticket office. A family pass was a great deal and reduced to 47 pounds when buying it online.",A fun and historically interesting afternoon
"March 24, 2011","The thing that struck me the most about the Tower of London is the overwhelming sense of history that it exudes.  For me it wasn't the crown jewels or even the beefeaters (or Yeoman Warders to be correct :-) that created a connection to the past but the architecture itself.  There really is something special about touching stonework that was completed on the orders of William I.  Certainly worth a visit for anyone interested in British history.I would however recommend not going during 'peak times'.  I went at lunch time on a Saturday and some of the ques were pretty long.  I'd recommend either going in the morning before the coaches of tourists arrive or later on in the afternoon, although I should point out the last Yeoman Warder tour is at 3.30pm.",Impressive
"April 24, 2021",Fantastic experience with a lot of interesting sightings and plenty of history Kids really enjoyed themselves as well as got a bit of knowledge,Tower of London
"December 29, 2020",Visiting it gives you a lot of knowledge about Royal family history.  And was so nice seeing ravens just walking around you! The best time for going their is the summer. ,"In constant awe, the crowd jewels are a must see"
"November 27, 2020",Worth every penny!! We visited July 2019 and my goal was to see the Crown Jewels. This place certainly exceeded my expectations. There was a full day of things to see and learn about. It was very hot in July with limited share so an umbrella may be good to have.,Great for socially distanced visit
"November 6, 2020","It was a stay-at-home August and I wasn't sure about getting out to London at first.  Tickets were easy to get at short notice and we found only a short queue on arrival.  Inside within 10 minutes, we found plenty of space for distancing.  All internal areas were accessible and it was easy to observe distancing rules with all routes clearly marked out.  Great day out if you like history and the look of crown jewels.  Beefeaters were very welcoming, answered every question and posed for photos.  A great day out for a history buff or anyone with kids.",A terrific tour!
"October 31, 2020","We hadn’t planned to visit the Tower of London but changed our minds while we were in London as it sounded so good! It was definitely worth it. There were no Yeoman tours available that day so we booked standard tickets and paid an extra £5 each for the audio guidebooks which were really interesting and informative and made the Tower visit easy to follow. I would recommend the audio guidebooks if you can’t book a real-life tour. We were able to see the Crown Jewels which was super impressive and well worth the visit, even just for that! We also saw the White Tour which is now a museum (I recommend doing that last), and the famous Ravens protecting the Tower. The only thing we could see was the prison, it was closed. I’m not sure if it was closed due to Covid-19 restrictions or just generally closed as it wasn’t clear but nevertheless there is a lovely space outside where you can sit on a bench and listen to the audio guidebook explaining about all of the infamous characters who were executed there!  Just beside there you can see the beefeaters guarding the entrance to the Crown Jewels. A lovely visit and I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for something to do in London!",Half A Day Required to Walk Through London's History
"October 29, 2020","My travelling buddy & I started our day by visiting the Tower of London as I wanted to see the Crown Jewels. We headed to the closest underground station which was Tower Hill & crossed the road to get to the Tower of London. Since we had bought the London Pass, entry to The Tower of London which was £28.90 was free. All we had to do was show the London Pass app on our respective handphones to the gatekeeper & get it scanned & we were in!We joined the Yeoman Tour as it is included in the price of an entry ticket. The tour lasts approximately 45 minutes to an hour & departs every 30 minutes. We were all led into the chapel of St Peter & Vincula to listen to a Yeoman who talked about the Tower’s stories. The Chapel is also the burial place of 3 Queens of England - Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard & Jane Grey. All were accused of adultery & treason.After the tour, we were led out of the chapel. We caught the “Changing of the Guards” session. It was so surreal. The guards were smartly dressed of course!We saw 2 of the Tower’s black ravens. They were on the ground & looked pretty much comfortable in the presence of humans. Currently, there are 7 ravens, in case 1 goes missing. Legend has it that if 6 ravens were to leave the court, the Tower will fall. The ravens are looked after by the Raven Master. Apparently, their wings have been clipped. There was also a huge canon on display for that instagram photo!Our 2nd stop was to the Crown Jewels. The queue was long & we waited close to 45 minutes before going in. The wait was worth it as we got to see the magnificent Crown Jewels on display. In my opinion, the most beautiful tiara on display was Queen Victoria’s Emerald Tiara. The Imperial State Crown which Queen Elizabeth II wore during her coronation was also displayed. Photography & video recording were not allowed as expected. There was a gift shop nearby & we dropped in as a 10% discount is given on all items to London Pass holders. Sadly, even with the discount, the items were quite expensive. Hence, we left empty-handed.Next was our visit to the White Tower, an example of Norman architecture in the heart of the Tower of London & one of the most iconic symbols in Britain. The Chapel of St John is in the White Tower. Basically, you can see the Royal Armouries in the White Tower & a dragon armour sculpture too!We also visited the Bloody Tower. It was where the 2 princes, Edward & Richard were kept before their disappearance. It was also thought that they were murdered there. Overall, I think half a day is required to visit all the places in The Tower of London.",Really Great Tour
"October 20, 2020","Visited early October, wanting to take advantage of the lack of crowds, (and kids!) and it was a great success. The Beefeater Tours are not currently being run which was a shame but we did opt for the Audio Tour at £5 per head so we would get history and context to what we were seeing. We have suffered some dreadful audio guides at attractions before so can confidently say this really was one of the best. The technology was very modern and easy to use, the audio very clear and informative and the visual guide on the smart screen of the device logical and easy to read, even in sunlight. The guide is actually several different tours to different areas of the palace, each perhaps 20 to 30 minutes so you can choose which you do and in which order. I would say do them all, especially when it was as quiet and comfortable to move about as it is now. Good value at £5.We had no concerns re Covid the whole time and staff were in evidence throughout cleaning and wiping surfaces. There were no queues and we saw everything really easily. It’s also important to say that the history, grounds, displays and building are amazing. The difficulty is trying to ‘get your head around’ the fact the tower has stood pretty much as it is for 1,000 years!","Fantastic place to visit, so much information and history"
"October 19, 2020","The Crown Jewels are amazing, the whole place is full of history and it is very easy to access all the information you need. Probably the best historical venue l have been to",First trip to the Tower 
"October 18, 2020",Loved everything about this place. We had a tour with a beefeater... this is an absolute must. So informative and so much to do in the tower l. You can easily spend the whole day.  ,What a wonderful experience
"October 17, 2020","We needed time away from home so decided to go to London for a few days and as I'd only ever walked round the Tower of London I decided to book to go in.  Wow did I chose the right time to go.  Had a wonderful time was able to able round looking at everything and not being rushed or pushed out the way there were only about 400 people booked to go round for the whole day instead of the thousands ... a plus point of Covid (the only one) was really interesting and the Beefeaters were all so friendly and I believe really enjoyed telling you about the Tower.  As for the Crown Jewels well whats not to like about them.  Again you was able to really spend time looking at everything and reading about it all.  All in all a very wonderful experience shame it took me so long to get there, but then would I have enjoyed it as much with crowds of people?",Must See
"August 13, 2004",This is a must see when in London.  Follow the Beefeaters tours.  They add alot of humor with the information they provide.While you are there see they Crown Jewels.  Pictures do not do them justice.,WOW! So that's how they did it...
"July 10, 2004","I visited the Tower of London by myself and had the best time! I was over in London for a study abroad, and was trying to avoid any places that would teach me useless history- but I got a kick out of walking through the tower and seeing the different tourture devices and weapons used in all different types of battle. This would be a good place to take kids, as there are people dressed up in ""old london"" clothes that perform sword fighting acts and such. The exit of the Tower is also right by the London Bridge. This was definitely worth the wait, but it is sort of a long wait. But highly recommended.",Neat place but NOT appropriate for small children
"December 16, 2003","We found the Tower of London fascinating -- from the history to the architecture to the tour by the ""Beefeaters"". I can't really add anything to the previous reviews EXCEPT a small warning. We brought two smallish children (< 4 years) there, which was a mistake. Not only was there very little to hold their interest, but so much of the Tower is twisty staircases and narrow passageways, basically useless for strollers. If you do bring kids in strollers, you'll end up either doing what my wife and I did - taking turns sitting outside with the kids while the other goes through the various towers and exhibits - or missing the best parts entirely.",A must see
"September 23, 2003","There are not enough words to describe the Tower. If you are not a history buff, there is still plenty to go and see from the armor displays to the Crown Jewels. If you are a history buff, it is a completely jaw dropping, awe inspiring experience. The vast differences of the experiences of the people who have lived there - voluntarily or not - is something that sounds as if it is out of a romance fiction, but it's not, and you are standing right where it happened.The entry line is long (or was when I went) but oh, is it worth it.",Soooooo Very Worth It!
"September 20, 2003",I can't say enough good things about the Tower. It is worth every penny of its entrance fee. There are so many things to see and learn about that you will more than likely be overwhelmed and in awe at the same time. Ask the beefeaters about some of the ghost stories of the tower or about anything at all from its history and it's guaranteed they will have the answer. Also check out Tower Bridge while you are there. It has stories of it's own right to be shared.,Great Tourist Destination - just avoid TodayTix
"October 16, 2023","Great place to visit as a solo traveller. Would recommend buying tickets directly through the tower ticket window. I bought a ticket online through #todaytix and even though the name suggests tickets for today, I selected the next available date for entry ticket looking at the day of the week not the actual date. Turns out they only sell tickets for a week in advance. After noticing the error within two minutes of purchase, after multiple chats through their bot and email support. They were unwilling to help resolved the issue and effectively stated too bad you agreed with t&c which state no refund. Anyone seeing this post and what a cheap entry ticket for Wed 18 Oct 2023. Please let me know. ","Interesting experience, reinforces our historical knlowedge."
"September 1, 2023","Interesting experience, much larger area than I expected, was unaware of the layers of defense. Surprised by the size of the area on confinement for Ann Boylin. Was unaware of the torture devices. ",Amazing Experience
"August 31, 2023","We could feel historical significance of this castle in so many ways. More than three hours flew by as we explored the place. I found it be a very moving experience. And for our teenage son, it was the highlight of our trip. ",Amazing experience and well worth the time and money
"August 31, 2023","Great experience and way to learn about the history of London! We found this very informative and rich with information that you could read and explore at your own pace.

We would recommend going early, we went when it opened and didn’t have to queue for the Crown Jewels (go here first to avoid lines) and managed to see everything before it got super crowded","A Must see, book the 10 a m tour!"
"June 19, 2023","When in London….this has to be on your list for sure! SO many things to see, the castle does not disappoint, Crown Jewels however did somewhat…mostly bc I thought I’d see all the Tiaras they’re always fighting about (isn’t there always a battle over who will wear what tiara to which wedding??)….and NO tiaras! Lots of crowns on display, still breathtaking, but no tiaras! Just saying….Kids loved the Armory, we appreciated the history! LOTS of stairs to climb so if you have knee/hip issues, this may be a tough one for you. Also, try to make the 10 am tour as it gets VERY busy and line ups go around the castle for tickets!!",Important Structure to England and London - MUST SEE 
"May 28, 2023","For me any visit to London should include a visit to the Tower.  There are things in London older and today there are things that are more significant.  However, there is probably nothing older in creating the significance of London today than the Tower.  While London was important to the Romans, it lost all significance until William the Conqueror established the White Tower here shortly after taking control of England.  From that moment forward, the Crown of England became more and more linked to London.  For a long time this was the Royal Palace residence.  However, over time as new palaces and governmental institutions were created, especially those in Westminster, the Tower lost its political importance.  Still, it continued to have an importance as a prison and as a place of protection.  Today the Crown Jewels are still held and protected here.  All of this is essential to the reason you should visit.  When you visit, absolute must sees are the White Tower (the original Norman fortress) and the Crown Jewels.  However, do not miss the outer rings of towers and fortress walls.  We started our tour at the entrance with the lions, who symbolize the ruling family monarch.  However, shortly after entering the Byward Tower, we entered the Traitor's gate to climb up to Wakefield Tower which had some good displays of when the castle was a royal residence.  We then walked the outer walls for great pictures of the city (some of the best we have) to see the Lanthorn and Salt Towers before making our way to the former royal menagerie (zoo).  We then walked the inner courtyard before visits to the Crown Jewels and White Tower.  Let me say the White Tower has the armory and some fun things for children as well as a beautiful stone Norman chapel.  Before leaving we stopped to see the display for the wives of Henry VIII and then we saved the best for last.  Any visit to the tower has to see the Ravens whose presence is required to keep the monarch in power.  Again this is an important building for both England and London and it is essential for any visit.  ",Be prepared to queue and patiently wait (and hope you might see something!)
"April 11, 2023","Been about 10 years since my last visit and had been prior to that too. This time it seemed it was catering for the masses and do I mean masses - almost impossible to see exhibits such were the crowds. This was not over the Easter weekend either ! Goodness knows what it would’ve been like then. Given we spent over £100 on tickets this was hugely disappointing.  Despite a really good  guided tour, which given inclement weather took place in the chapel (a relief as there were so many people it would have been impossible to hear otherwise), it was simply queues, queues and almost fight to see something. I have huge nostalgia for past visits. Don’t think I will be back again which is quite disappointing as this was my favourite place to visit in London.",Great place
"November 7, 2022",Great place! Great experience for adults! Great experience for kids!You feel the history in the walls. Unforgettable!,Auld England
"August 26, 2022","We went there this morning, August 26, 2022. It was everything I expected of old English history and more. We entered about 9:00 after buying tickets at the ticket booth.  We were told about the Jewels tower, so we decided to see that before it became too crowded to enjoy. Bummer that they don’t allow you to take photos inside of it, but we could in other parts of the tower buildings. The coronets in the Jewels tower were breathtaking, and thinking about how old they were was mind boggling. The tower opens at 9:00 and it’s probably a good idea to get there early to avoid crowds. Also enjoy the spectacular views of the London Bridge while you are there.",Brilliant 
"October 8, 2020","With no queues, we were able to wonder around without impediment. We got to see the Crown Jewels without being rushed, and took time to marvel at places so steeped in history. I wish the Yeoman Tours was on, but in the current climate, it is understandable why they are cancelled - this said, they are around ti answer questions. ",September 2020
"October 6, 2020","Very quiet,we went at 12noon, no queues to get in or to see the Crown Jewels.Great time to visitRavens were on form ",History
"October 4, 2020",Really enjoyable visit..lots to see...stepped in history..approachable staff...have been before..always see something new ,Superbloom super bad
"June 30, 2022",Waste of time and money Lots of dead plants and more or less the same flowers all the way round.Was in and out in 15 minutes.Seen better at my local park.,A surprising highlight for the 10y old kid!
"June 12, 2022","A surprising highlight for the 10y old kid! Our recommendation align with many others here: - Meet up early on the day if possible (we met up 10:00 on a Saturday)- Go straight to the Crown Jewels (if interested). This was the second best thing to do for us- Then go for a tour with the Yeomen Warders (Beefeaters). If you and your kids understand English, this must be 10x better than the audio guide. The beefeaters give you a fantastic impression of the life behind the tower walls. Look out for Scott Kelly!- If you have time and energy, go through the buildings and sites.",cracking day
"April 19, 2022","Tower of London is without doubt, one of the best days out in London.  If you want the Crown Jewels get there early as you can, as 90 minute / 2 hour waits are not unusual - we walked straight in at 10am! don't be tempted with a coffee and breakfast otherwise you'll end up queuing.  Get on a free beefeater tour - they are so knowledgeable, and although they look like their in costume (don't ever call it a costume though) , they are ex - servicemen / women with a minimum of 22 years in the armed forces.  There is much to do, but do a beefeater tour first (after the crown jewels) to get your bearings and understand what it is you are looking at - this is not Disney or Harry Potterland, but a 1,000 years of British history. There are cobbles so walking in high heals in not recommended - those damned Tudors had no consideration.  Nothing required more that 5 minutes queuing and you can amuse yourself with gasps of ""awesome"" every few moments  from the queues.  People watching is a pastime in itself - do not miss the changing of the guards, but do not get in their way, as you wont be told as they will march straight over you.  The beefeaters are the friendly security you can see. The Tower is a working regimental armed forces headquarters so the three or four lines of security that you don't see are not just armed with sharp pointy sticks and a loud voice. We saw a couple of exhibits being transferred (under a blanket) inside the complex (whilst we were on the ramparts) with four man armed army escort - and that was inside the grounds.  They definitely weren't soft and cuddly security",Cheap at half the price (obviously)
"October 16, 2021","Feels odd doing a review for the Tower of London. You just simply must see it.We had a great morning out here. £29.90 each is a bit pricy, but we got two for one by printing off a voucher from National Rail, showed our train ticket at the box office and hey presto, half price.(You're welcome! :)We started off as many do with a yeoman (beefeater) tour that were running every 30 mind. The tour was free and starts just by the entrance. We had the honour of being led around by Yeoman Paul who is a real entertainer full of knowledge and a great sense of humour.He said we made his day by asking his name for a review. Nope, you made ours, mate.The tour is a fantastic way to start off the visit as its only 45 minutes to an hour and really sets you up to explore the rest of this beautiful historic masterpiece yourself.We finished the experience with a well earned trip to the Spoons opposite so really did experience the best of British that day. ;)",Awesome place
"May 31, 2021",One of the best landmarks in London Loads fo things to see and do for all ages.Great historical place and steeped in history from 1066 to 2021.Highly recommend,Worth a visit 
"May 25, 2021",If you like history and gory details of previous royalty and this is the place for you. I was blown away by the crown Jules and also the various towers in which the Jesuit priests were imprisoned. ,"Very quiet for a summer’s day, but not as quiet as I had been led to believe"
"September 28, 2020","Having seen several reviews, and some advertising, saying how quiet the Tower of London was we decided to give it a try.The highlight of this visit of St Thomas’s Tower with the reconstruction of Edward I's bed-chamber – a wonderful room with fantastic views; just now sure how we missed this on our last visit!This was our second visit this year (meaning our “Historic Royal Palaces” family pass has already saved us money) – the last was in January and I can definitely say the Tower of London was busy than in January.  In January there were no queues to see the crown jewels, in August there was a long queue. The advantage of the HRP pass is that you don’t feel you have to see everything in one go (hence missing St Thomas’s tower on the previous visit) which then makes the whole visit a lot more relaxing.During lockdown there are no warden tours, so the Beefeaters were a lot more visible and easier to ask questions of.  In addition, the area next to the Thames was cordoned off and only accessible to those visiting the tower (a huge plus as this area is often packed with sightseers).  Outdoor catering and toilets are available. Not all of the Tower of London has re-opened, but still well worth a visit.",Great experience
"September 27, 2020",We had a lovely time visiting the Tower of London. It was very well run with all COVID measures adhered to.,Brilliant
"September 21, 2020",Brilliant! We all thoroughly enjoyed it. The stories you hear on the way round are made for teenage boys! Crown Jewels are spectacular. Can’t recommend enough.,Mr & Mrs Abedalkarim 
"September 21, 2020","We visited the Tower on Sunday and we are very disappointed that we were not informed about the facilities that would be closed off ,  it seems most of the jewels were locked away. We understand about the COVID situation but the cost was inappropriate with lack of advanced closures.",Worth a Historical Visit
"September 21, 2020",Crown Jewels are just awesome. You have to admire the craftsmanship of these beautiful pieces of our history.  We could not guess the value! Lovely to see the Yeomans and Guards in their uniforms.  The Yeomans are so informative and such gents! Walk around the battlements for goods views of London. Traitors Gate is no longer is surrounded by water but stand there and think about the poor souls entering their fate.,For history lovers
"September 20, 2020","Well preserved monument, with reach history. Early visit recommended to avoid large groups. A tour guide was very helpful.",One of the best experiences I have ever had!
"September 19, 2020","Wow! This is a fantastic trip. Firstly, to be there without the usual crowds was brilliant as you could really take your time and get a good look at everything. There is so much to see with so many twists and turns.An absolute highlight... in fact one of greatest moments I have ever experienced was visiting the Crown Jewels. Simply stunning and displayed so fantastically so you can really soak it up from all angles and see every detail. A wonderful lady (I wish I had her name to quote) took time to personally explain each item and tell us all about its history and the different gems that were in them, who they were designed for etc. She was fabulous and really went the extra mile! Overall one of the best attractions I have visited in London! I LOVED it and will never forget my experience.",Very interesting. 
"February 26, 2020","As far as I can remember I've never visited the tower before, and with an entry price of £24 it's a pretty reasonable entry price considering I was in the tower complex for almost 5 hours! And to be honest if I hadn't got a timed train to get home I would've stayed for longer. There's plenty to see and do with loads of information provided, so there's a lot to read! I have to admit I've never seen so much gold in one place, the sheer amount of gold and crowns on display was just staggering! To me it seems amazing that someone can own so much when there's so many people with so little! Overall a visit here is worth every penny and I'm pleased I've finally seen the tower! ",Wow! Amazing monument
"February 24, 2020","We just walked around it, but the monument is an amazing building. Easy to find - walking path all around the entire building. ",Great tour
"February 21, 2020",Great tour & interesting history.Great tour & interesting history.Great tour & interesting history.,Busiest day of the year at the Tower of London!
"February 15, 2020","We booked our visit for Sat Dec 28th as we had only 5 days in London — turns out it was the busiest day of the year, with 20,000+ visitors!  Booking the tickets online saves money but it does lock you in to a specific date and time. No issue for us. Our beefeater guide—Yeoman Warder Steve—knowledgeably delivered history with wit and style, but our tour group was enormous, which at times made it difficult to hear him. We explored the buildings and enjoyed the various guides and displays (White Tower, Bloody Tower, prison, torture chamber) but found the narrow, winding circular stairways a challenge for 2-way traffic.The queue to see the a Crown Jewels was over 2 hours long, so we gave it a miss.  We easily spent 4 hours at the site, and could have lingered longer. Tower Bridge is adjacent—we walked across it numerous times but did not pay to tour it—and there are some spectacular views for photographers.It is worth doing some research in advance so you can strategize what you want to see if you are a history buff and you don’t have a full day. Highly recommended!",Definitely a must stop!
"February 12, 2020","This is one of the places that I could have spent so much more time.   It is great that you can wander at will thru the entire castle and grounds.  The crown jewels were disappointing, but over-all, the authenticity of the place was engrossing.",Must see
"February 10, 2020","Very interesting historical placeWorth visit just to view from the outside.a great place to visit in winter. stunning.you can,, 't miss it if you' re visiting London ",A must see in London
"February 9, 2020",Visiting the legendary Tower of London is a must see for anyone who pays any attention to the evolution of western civilization. Amazing stories well presented in a tourist friendly intriguing style,First Visit
"February 9, 2020",Great place of historic value. Got tickets from Discount London online and saved over £30! Some fab things to see and the Crown jewels are not to be missed! Great way to spend a morning ,One of the best in London. 
"February 5, 2020",If you are in London for sightseeing or travel you should never miss this place. This place is so good to learn history. ,Worth a visit!
"February 2, 2020","Something everyone should do on their first London visit.....arrive before the gates open, go straight to crown jewels then meander around everywhere else.  A lot of stairs to climb but there is so much history here - just do it!",A real must if you're in London for a holiday
"March 18, 2020","A great experience, to begin with. You'll spend at least a couple of hours, maybe even 3 if you go to every available room, courtyard or armory.Also, the audio guide is informative and entertaining, and even moving, from time to time. Fully recommended.",Expensive - but worth it!
"March 17, 2020","I didn't even want to take this tour when we arrived - but my wife and daughter did!  I'm so glad they insisted.  Everything was above excellent.  If you love history, this one that should not be missed",Tower of London
"March 17, 2020",This is a must see if you’re visiting London. Be sure to allow yourself at least several hours to roam through the complex which includes the Crown Jewels and an extensive display of armor. Take the guided tour with one of the ‘Beefeaters’ who are knowledgeable and spirited.,Awesome
"March 10, 2020",Great piece of architecture with great history. Its must visit in london. Often rated as top attraction of london. ,A must watch place
"March 7, 2020",The kids would resonate with the rhyme of London bridge is falling down.Do take the river ride on Thames Clippers,Must visit
"March 7, 2020","This is one of the most visited sites world wide not only in London , to make the most of your visit to understand the history you either join a tour or take the Audio guide and thats what I have done ,using the audio guide will help you understand the history with no rush of the tour, the rich history of this site is over whelming , and you will get the chance to see the royal jewellery there. This place will take between 2 hours and 4 hours of your time ( 4 hours if you want to go deeper in the history side as this castle was the home of many kings and queens ). Best time to visit early morning",Well worth the time and money!
"March 5, 2020","I just wasn’t sure about the price but very glad I made the time to go.So much to see, plan on spending the day.","Dave, Yeoman Warder, was amazing!"
"March 4, 2020","Dave gave us the best introduction to Tower of London! He was really informative and entertaining. We spent two hours exploring. The Crown Jewels was a highlight but the full history was fascinating. And, yes Dave, I thought there was only 1 tower. ",Amazing history
"March 3, 2020",Great place but tickets way over priced for qhat it is.My little boy has been desperate to visit the Tower of London and especially the Crown Jewels. It did not disappoint. The Yeoman tour was brilliant and gave really interesting historical facts. My son loved becoming a knight at knight school.Great day out overall but way too expensive.,Lots of history
"February 28, 2020",The history in this place is amazing. The chance to see the precious crown jewels was worth the price of admission. Also spectacular views of tower bridge. ,Excellent experience 
"February 1, 2020","There is so much to see here that you could nearly spend a full day here The building itself is so impressive, the views spectacular The way the tour is organized is superb The variety to see, the various rooms & the interactive parts are excellent The Crown Jewels obviously a highlight My son wanted to see the ravens but sadly only one was aroundStaff excellent and very knowledgeable Highly recommend ",The white castle
"January 29, 2020",Great place to visit enjoyed the beefeater your very factual and interesting enjoyed the walk around afterwards found it factual interesting great staff,Tower of London is a must!
"January 29, 2020","So I decided to spend a day by myself to explore this amazing historical place in London. And it turned out to be the highlight of my entire trip! What a place!I spent three hours there and it wasn’t enough; I hope that I can go again one day to learn what I have missed the first time.My advice to you :1- make sure you allocate enough time for this visit2- the entry fee is so worth it 3- you don’t need to buy in advance as there wasn’t a long queue 4- make sure you buy the audio guide, it’s really good 5- leave some time to read and try the interactive information games6- it’s better to go by yourself especially if you’re getting the audio guide because it takes you to another world 7- make sure you visit all the towers and better if you read about them beforehand Enjoy!! ",History comes alive!
"January 28, 2020","The Tower is one of the oldest fortified sites in Britain, and certainly the most famous. It is easy to dismiss it as a trite tourist site, but that would be a critical mistake. Best to read something about the history of the Tower before going, and then both taking a tour if you have the time, or at least walking around with a guidebook. It's the details that make the Tower fascinating. The armorial museum, for example, is spectacular, but the details to notice include the dents in some of the armor from proofing: the were shot with firearms to make sure bullets would bounce off. The lists of imprisonments and executions are daunting but an authentic and unavoidable part of British history. The architecture of the Tower and its place in the development of 11th century fortifications also merits close attention.One could easily spend half a day or a full day here. The most rewarding visit, however, would combine the Tower with a ceremony or pageant celebrated there. Remembrance Day is a good example, but there are many others. The Tower also is sometimes the site of summer concerts, and that brings forth yet another aspect. A very special and memorable place.",Always great.
"January 28, 2020",Been to this fabulous place many times before. Every time its great value for money with so much to see and do. Hope to return soon.,Monumental.
"January 27, 2020","No visit to London is complete without a visit to the Tower of London, with its rich history, the Crown Jewels and countless photo-ops of this magnificent fortress.",Gotta see!
"January 27, 2020","If you’ve only limited time in London, the Tower should be a top priority! Be sure to catch a Yeoman’s Tour—they begin right after the entrance and are free—to catch the spirit and hear the stories that go with the Crown Jewels, turrets, etc.",60th Birthday Trip
"January 26, 2020","This was the 1st visit for my husband but he hates crowds so decided to go in January as knew it would be quieter, what a great experience, we headed straight to the Crown Jewels (WOW) then to the White Tower also WOW, then mooched around the walls and then went for some lunch, allow plenty of time.",Must See in London
"January 25, 2020","Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly gave us a memorable tour:  super interesting and full of information, but also very funny.",Super interesting!!!
"January 25, 2020","First of all, the guided tour was awesome! The tour guide was extremely funny and redacted the storys in a fascinating way. Absolutely loved the place.",Fantastic!
"August 12, 2020","Amazing, beautiful place.  Stunning buildings, fascinating history.  So sad to learn from the Beefeaters that it is facing threat of closure following lockdown.  Please visit!  It is quiet and you will see the crown jewels without the usual queues.",Family visit to the Tower of London
"July 23, 2020",Due to the pandemic we booked as a family for 10.30. We arrived on time and the organisation was excellent. Everyone was extremely helpful. It was a wonderful experience. The Yeomen were exceptional. We were able to see everything. The facilities although limited were excellent. I was with my daughters and grandchildren who loved everything they saw. As an older person everyone was extremely kind and helpful. It was a wonderful experience and we all had a fantastic visit.,Felt ripped off!
"July 22, 2020","Went with kids and family. Mum booked tickets on the website, but didn’t realise a lot of it is closed due to Covid-19!For £25 (instead of the usual £30) I felt ripped off!The grounds and the houses are beautiful - it’s like a little village inside, the yeomen are friendly and helpful, but all we saw was the White Tower and the Crown Jewels - the rest was closed - the kids were looking forward to seeing the Bloody Tower, but it was closed. We all thought it was quite boring!I think £15 is OK to pay. £25 is FAR too much - especially as I am a British taxpayer living in London - these things should be free or heavily discounted for us, it’s our history!In the summer months, roughly 12,000 people visit the tower, at around £30 per person that is ALOT of money!",To many people taking selfies
"July 21, 2020",I really enjoyed my visit to the Tower of London though it was way too busy full of selfie   taking tourists who didn't care about the history of the place. I had to wait 20 minutes to see the crown jewels because of everyone had there backs to it and phones out.,Great time to visit - and support a good cause
"July 19, 2020","This was the second weekend of opening after the COVID closure of summer 2020. We we able to book tickets a couple of days beforehand. Numbers are strictly controlled and this is probably a unique opportunity at any time of year to visit with just a hundred or so visitors within the Tower at any one time. Strongly recommended!Entry was very efficient - we arrived a few minutes early and went straight in - and there is a clear one wau route through the castle. Like most Londoners, I last went when I was ten, so it was great to see it again with more knowledge. I took my teenage daughter for her art project on armour and we spent a happy 90 minutes there - could easily have been longer. The smaller buildings are shut (but there is plenty to see outside), and the Crown Jewels and White Tower had plenty on show inside, including the beautiful Norman chapel. There were enough visitors inside the exhibitions that we felt more comfortable wearing masks - it is not compulsory. The ticket feels good value (and I'm now upgrading my ticket to membership so as to visit Kensigton and Hampton Court too). The beefeaters and guides have plenty of time to explain things to visitors - including the huge impact of COVID on the palaces' finances. If you can visit, it is both a unique time to do so, and a very good cause.One set of toilets is open, but there is no cafe or indoor seating open in the Tower (a takeaway kiosk would be useful), so take a snack and a drink. We ate afterwards, looking over the Thames and with a coffee from the little kiosk by the pier. Catering options in the immediate vicinity are pretty limited, particularly on a Sunday.",TOWER OF LONDON TOUR
"June 13, 2020","If there is a tour you must do while visiting London, it is this one! This tour had so much educational information and was so well explained that if felt like I was living in the actual time. Our tour guide is dressed like a knight and explains in detail everything about the castle. He walks you to the courtyard, the different rooms in the castle, all while explaining everything to you and interacting with you. He challenges you while you learn and makes everyone stay engaged. You will also see how they used to do the changing of the guards there AND you get to see the jewels used by the old kings and queens. It was totally worth it... takes no longer than 2 hours.",Great -- even in the rain
"June 7, 2020",Always love going here. A must is the chapel tour where the go over the history. Not too long and good information.,Thanksgiving holiday
"May 16, 2020","We enjoyed exploring London over Thanksgiving. The Christmas decorations were up so we enjoyed those at night. Tower of London was entertaining, we spent about 3 hours there including a great beefeater tour. ",Amazing
"April 14, 2020",I always had an interest about castles. And this building satisfied me most so far. This place is actually something as cool as Eiffel tower. ,You MUST do the Beefeater tour
"March 22, 2020","Being that we only had about 1.5 days in London before heading to Africa, we had limited time to pick what do to but WOW we are happy we chose that Tower. You can spend HOURS here if you have the Time but we managed to see a lot in about 2.5 hrs. The Beefeater tour, included in the price, is worth it; so much information and great British humor too! Don't miss the Crown Jewels as well! The grounds were beautiful and so many great places to grab pics! Don't miss out on this fantastic attraction: )",Awesome 
"December 24, 2019",Have been twice now and still have not seen it all yet fantastic easy to get around and there something for everyone ,Tier of London
"December 24, 2019",Absolutely loved this visit. Didn’t get to see everything due to time but learnt so much from what I did see. Definitely recommend this but plan for a whole day visit.,Beautiful at night
"December 23, 2019","We were only in London overnight so we had to see it at night, no option to go in.  Beautiful views of the tower and the bridge.",Nice Historic Perspective
"December 22, 2019","We waited for a tour from a Beefeater, and I think that is probably the best part of the visit. It only lasted around 30 minutes, and that is probably the biggest shame. The Beefeater was knowledgeable and entertaining, and I would have liked to listen/learn more. The crown jewels are obviously spectacular to see, but pictures are not allowed. The White Tower holds plenty of history, but overall I wouldn't expect to spend more than two hours at the Tower in total.",Amazing. 
"December 22, 2019",Highlight of our first trip to London. We spent nearly 3 and a half hours here. We did not utilize a tour but instead had our own materials for info. I imagine it’s a bit hectic during peak times so thankfully we came during off season. So much history. This site is very well kept and informative to those speaking other languages as well. ,Because it is still posible to live history
"December 22, 2019",if you love all the movies about being a knight in shining armor then the tower is for you. i felt i was at the round table,The Tour Guides Are Fantastic!
"December 22, 2019","We went on a rainy day, as all of our trip was rainy. Unfortunately, by the time the next tour was set to start, it was a downpour. The guards took it in stride and did a condensed version of the tour in the chapel, before letting us explore solo. We got a lot of the information regarding the property and the Tower of London, as a whole. It was nice to have them be so accommodating, especially as many people in our group were not prepared to spend the day in the rain. We were able to explore the grounds on our own also, so I felt it was still worth going, despite the weather. I hope to go back for the full tour on a sunny day in the future.",History laden 
"December 21, 2019","Absolutely loved our visit to the Tower of London.  It was very, very cool to get a sense of life in the the Royal Court. Strongly encourage you to visit especially the go and see the Crown Jewels and the White Tower.  ",Value for money
"December 19, 2019","We took the audio guide option , partly because my partner is French and doesn't have a sufficiently good grasp of English to be able to fully understand a Beefeater's explanations , but principally because we wanted to do the tour at our rhythm and to linger or have a break when we wanted . We were there for over 4 hours and saw more or less everything , even getting to see the Crown Jewels before the hordes descended . Lots of stairs , mind you , so bear that in mind .",Impressive collection of armory but the Crown Jewels not to be missed.
"December 18, 2019","This was my second visit on a cold and rainy day. We toured the grounds and the different exhibits. Entering the Tower grounds took minutes but if you want to see the Crown Jewels expect to wait about 45 minutes. The jewels are stunning and simply should not be missed. The Ravens are neat, take a moment to learn the story. The place is spotless and well maintained, highly recommend this view into history.","History, glamour and lots of stories"
"November 20, 2019",This iconic historical attraction is great. We visited in November and taking advantage of 2 for 1 ( with train tickets) it became a reasonable priced excursion. Queues were non- existent and we were able to view the fabulous Crown Jewels leisurely.,Incredible 
"November 18, 2019","This is a must see attraction while in London , with a bushel of history. Very old and interesting. Many photo ops and close to the tower bridge and many other attractions. ",Beefeaters are a Blast!

"November 27, 2019","In a short walking distance from tube you will get an excellent all-day historical experience for a good value. If you don't like walking upstairs, you have still lots of options to choose from. The Crown Jewels exhibition is one of those stairs-free.After you finish the Tower, don't forget to take the Tower Bridge.",Excellent tour
"November 24, 2019",The beefeaters tour guide was informative and funny.  Was only disappointed when it ended. The Crown Jewels were magnificent!  The display in the White tower was also worth seeing.,Awesome tour
"November 24, 2019",We really enjoyed this visit.  Make sure to do one of the Yeoman tours to get the full experience.  Crown Jewel display is really impressive too.,Brenda
"November 23, 2019",Our second visit to this amazing historical Tower. The Yeoman were very informative and helpful especially when my mother (who's 87years young)was determined to walk up the steps of the White Tower. The first visit was to see the Poppies which was absolutely phenomenal. My mother has one of the Poppies pride of place encased on her sitting room wall!,Exceptional.  Please don't miss!
"November 23, 2019","Our Yeoman guide, William, was the absolute best part of our trip to London.  Tour was outstanding and the grounds themselves really awesome.  We're not big ""tourist attraction"" or ""museum"" people, but this was a really great activity for 3 hours or so.  Also has a cafe with pretty good food. ",Loaded with history 
"November 23, 2019","We went to Tower of London just this past Monday and it’s a must see if you are visiting London. Loaded with history and information that will occupy your mind. I have heard you need 2-3 hours here and that’s a fair assessment. We spent over 2 hours wandering around on our own, not following the guided tour. Definitely do not miss it! ",Fantastic History and Enjoyable
"November 23, 2019","Thankfully it didn’t rain on us on this trip. Our kids enjoyed wandering through all the exhibits as they were definitely kid friendly, especially the museum portion dedicated to the history of weapons used back in the last couple hundred years.  I personally enjoyed seeing the Crown Jewels, and reveling in their beauty and splendor.  It was a fantastic morning!",Let the Yeomen guide you!
"November 22, 2019","A cold November day we took the guided tour with Clive.The hour just slipped by while our Yeoman Guide shared with us history and anecdotes of the tower. The rest was excellent , worth a trip just to see the jewels.",Historic Site
"November 21, 2019","Do take the Beefeater tour which is free along with the ticket. Lots of history associated with this site. Off course the Crown Jewels are here, and are a must see. Allot at least 2 hours to cover most of it. Highly recommended. ",Highlight of any visit to London.
"November 6, 2019",Well worth every cent to visit this historic site. Spent hours here and found all of the exhibits well laid out. When early to avoid the long wait to view the Crown Jewels. ,DO NOT MISS !!!
"November 5, 2019",This is the History of London and England. If you love history and want to learn the origins of the city and country---from the beginning---it starts here. Magnificent preservation. ,Loved it
"October 29, 2019","We toured the tower and loved it. Get there when it opens and see the Crown Jewels first to avoid long lines. You can rent an audio tour for 5# that is nice. Or take a guided tour. Be aware there are lots of steps and hills so wear comfortable shoes. The history is amazing and be sure to go into the church. Almost 1000 years old and still uses for services,  plan on 3-4 hours unless there are lines.",Crown jewels were beautiful
"October 27, 2019",Everyone needs to see the crown jewels on their trip to London.  There is a lot to experience here if you like medieval history.  This place has existed for a thousand years. you can feel the history as you walk around and in the buildings.,An Outstanding Experience
"October 27, 2019","The Tower of London is a genuine five star site, especially if you are the slightest bit interested in history. We arrived at opening time where we picked up our on-line tickets. Although getting in was a bit slow, the Tower precinct is big enough for the crowds to be spread out.There is much to see as sections of the Tower were constructed at different times. The Medieval Palace, the White Tower and the battlements and even the ravens are all fascinating while the Crown Jewels display is not only interesting, the flow of people is well managed. The family consensus was that the display about the death of the Princes during the Wars of the Roses was the highlight of that part of the history which dealt with imprisonment, torture and executions.The Tower is not to be missed.","Crown Jewels are here, lots of history"
"October 26, 2019","It takes about 3 hours to see what you want but this was great to see the history of London here. Included are the Crown Jewels, which are sometimes removed because current royalty borrow them for events. There are tours of armor, the ravens, and so much more. Very close to the Tower Bridge and Thames River cruises. ",Why was this never on my to-do list for London??
"October 24, 2019","As a history buff, I’m really wondering why I never visited the Tower of London during my previous work trips!! This is a very popular attraction, particularly for schoolgroups. We went straight through with the London Pass and joined the first Beefeater tour of the day, which really helped to set the scene for the rest of the visit. The tours were really popular with large groups but the yeomen made sure that they could be heard and were very funny and entertaining. The ravens were big birds! We did not have to wait to see the crown jewels as we were there fairly early, and they were definitely worth the time.Most parts of the entire well-preserved complex were used for different exhibits, which made for a good half day of exploration. Routes were well sign-posted to ensure one-way traffic only and prevent congestion in narrow spaces. Not a place for those with mobility issues. An easy walk to Tower Bridge from the exit along the river. ",MUST Visit while in London
"October 24, 2019","I was hesitant to visit the Tower of London because of the crowds and price but - it lives up to the hype guys. So cool. So much amazing history here! I could easily have spent 3-4 hours at the Tower of London if we hadn’t gone so close to closing. Yeoman Warder tours are offered hourly and included in admission price. Make sure you join a tour!  I’m usually not a fan of organized tours, but Yeoman Warder Scott Kelley was seriously the highlight of our visit. He told us some amazing stories/history and was hilarious. He had the whole crowd laughing and entertained the entire time. Tip: buy your tickets online rather than at the ticket office to save a few pounds 😉",Fantastic day out - allow at least 4 hours.
"October 24, 2019",As soon as you enter into the entrance gate join the Beefeater guided tour - so informative and they walk you through the main buildings and walkways leaving you near the entrance to the Crown Jewels.  The guided tours are every half hour and included in the price of your ticket and last just under an hour.  Our hour flew by very quickly with Barney as our guide.  He was helpful; informative and very funny - telling all jokes as if he was telling them for the first time.  At the end of the tour we were free to walk throughout all of the buildings and quickly joined the queue for the Crown Jewels (which had more than doubled when we left).  So much history and so many interested things to see with plenty of interactive displays for the children.  An absolute must for anyone visiting London!,Tower of London-the jewel in England's crown
"October 23, 2019","The Tower of London is a must-see for every traveler to London. It was here that William the Conqueror built his fortress/tower to stake claim to London. The history of the fortress, wall and Tower are all explained in detail by the delightful Yeoman - or 'Beefeaters' as they are called. These ‘Beefeaters’ live in the Tower. It was interesting to learn about the ravens that were all around the grounds. According to legend, at least 6 birds must stay within the fortress grounds or, legend has it, the monarchy will fall. Needless the say, the ravens are fed well and taken care of! We were fortunate to have a clear, sunny day so it really made the Tower experience a memorable one!",C'Mon...It's the Tower of London!!!
"October 23, 2019","Get there before 10 AM.  Wear comfortable walking shoes-the cobblestones are killers. If you want to view the Crown Jewels (and-why wouldn't you?!) get there at opening time and make a beeline for the exhibit...or be prepared to stand in a snaking line for over an hour.  Stop and listen to the Beefeaters giving their talk...educational and entertaining.  Be prepared for LOTS of steps, very windy and narrow staircases...and an amazing peek into the history of London.",Historical

"November 4, 2019","Expensive, but worth the price. Arrive early (preferably at opening)...go directly to the Crown Jewels Room (to avoid hours-long waits later)...next go to the Yeoman Warder Tour (BEST part of the day!) where you will learn EVERYTHING you need to know about the rest of your visit. Lovely day, wonderful experience. We spent twice as long as we had planned, there was so much to see! **PS Find a 2-for-1 coupon at ""Days Out London"".",Fabulous
"November 3, 2019","I arrived just after opening and there was hardly a queue. I didn't bother with the beefeater tour, audio or a guidebook as I like to fo my own thing. Pick up a free map as it suggests a basic route and you can then fit in the other bits yourself. There are plenty of information boards in multiple languages and even some Tudors still walking round! Give yourself 3 hours plus even at quiet times so you don't need to rush. The Crown Jewels are amazing, which I think is to be expected, but I found the armouries very interesting even though I didn't expect to. I was in awe to be able to walk in the footsteps of such as Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.",Pinnacle of London History!
"November 3, 2019",The Tower of London and the history behind it paints a picture of the ruling class and the many uses of the Tower and surrounding infrastructure throughout the years. The tour with a resident Beefeater is a must! The Crown Jewels and museum of artifacts are a nice touch. ,Hungary
"November 2, 2019",Do not miss it.Wery intresting and nice exhibition and building. Buy your ticket in advance not to wait too much.,Great morning out!
"November 2, 2019",It was my mom's first trip to London. This was her favorite stop. The free tour is short but packed with info. Then you are free to roam and explore. Would definitely recommend. ,Crown Jewels fantastic
"November 2, 2019","We thoroughly enjoyed the Tower of London. Even with Heavy crowds things moved smoothly. Plenty of food choices, interesting areas to visit, easy to know what your were looking at or walking. Just an enjoyable historical place to visit.",Arrive early!
"November 2, 2019",We took the advice on another review and arrived early to ensure we would see the crown jewels.  And we did!  Without a line to wait in.  Great historical learning experience.  Would recommend a visit!,Must see tour
"October 22, 2019","If you only go on one tour while in London make it the Tower of London and give yourself plenty of time. There is a lot more to see here than I thought. Very informative guide by the Tower Guards and have to be impressed by crown jewellery. Don’t worry about crowds, things move along. Avoid school holidays.",GIve your self time to see this
"October 22, 2019","We went to see this just after lunch, the lineups to the Crown jewels is very long, so my suggestion is to line up first,  if that is something you really want to see.  The lines do move fairly quickly, but it is still a long wait, but very worth it to see.   We also used their prerecorded tour, which gave a very good tour.  ",Great place to visit
"October 21, 2019",At first we were welcomed by the excelent guide of the place to the free tour. The guide was amusing and with a lot of knolledge. It was realy fun!the castle is big. Consider at least 2.5 hours for the visit. The london bridge is a nice photo from there.,Living History
"October 20, 2019",Fascinating place. i could easily spend all day there. Unfortunately time was limited as there were other places we wanted to see in the short time we were in London. The Crown Jewels are a must & are truly an incredible sight. Give yourself most of a day to truly experience the History of the Tower.,London tower History lesson 
"October 19, 2019","Thank you yeoman Scott Kelly for a fantastic, informative and entertaining tour of the Tower of London. This was my second time at the Tower and so glad I went back. If you get a chance make sure you do the free tour given by the beefeaters. You learn so much not just the history of the tower but also the beefeaters. The tour is only for 1 hour. ",Tower of London
"October 19, 2019","Good to finally visit the Tower of London. It was very interesting to explore the Tower, see the Crown Jewels and learn about some of the history of the site.",The Tower
"October 18, 2019","This place is really a fortress, so much history. Take a tour and listen to the tour guide, Beefeater.  So much history it was more than I could have imagined.  Time well spent. I recommend this on yourLondon experience.",Rich History
"October 18, 2019",It is worth the visit if you are into the history. This tower has a rich (also sad) history behind it. Long time ago people tried to escape it and today many people want to go inside it.They still have some old traditions and I really respect that.,Tour of London
"October 18, 2019",Make sure you start the tour with one of the Beefeaters. They added so much to the tour - history and humor.,Yeomen not impressive at all
"October 16, 2019","The Yeoman didn't impress - they pride themselves on being rude (as if it's supposed to be part of the ""act"") and we were herded in a group for a tour with commentary.  Asked very nicely for a photo with the Yeoman, he rudely acquiesced, sure they know they're going to get asked for photos a lot as part of the job? We couldn't hear the Yeoman when he started his spiel on the tour, an audience member respectfully requested him to speak up for us at the back, but this was ignored. So we got bored not hearing anything and went on our own to explore.  Look seeing the crown jewels was nice I guess, and exploring the buildings were really just okay, though the building with the armour and horse armour was quite impressive.  Seriously I think you get enough of an impression of what the Tower of London represents by viewing it from outside, and finding out information from the web.  My recommendation - save your money, truly.",A must place to visit in London
"October 9, 2019",This attraction is included with the London Pass. So its a direct entry to the gate. You don't need to visit the ticket counter. Please note that those with baby cart it can be quite difficult to carry the cart as climbing lots of stairs are involved in the visit. You can park your baby card just after the Traitors Gate by putting a 1 pound coin. The nearest metro station is Tower Hill and from there its only walkable distance. There is a tour with Yeoman Warders every 30 minutes. Sometimes it can be quite crowded but is also a good option to take the audio tour which is almost equivalent to what they say. You can have your own tour at your own pace. Expect about 2 - 3 hours of visit time.,A Must See
"October 8, 2019","This is a must-see on your visit to London.  I recommend buying your tickets online in advance to avoid lines.  We got there soon after it opened and went straight to the crown jewels before it got too crowded.  After that, we walked back to the entrance area to take the free yeoman warder's tour.  Not only do you get a great history lesson but it was very entertaining.  Shout out to our hilarious guide Jason Woodcock.  You can spend anywhere from a couple of hours here to all day.  It just depends on how much you want to see and read.",Expensive outing
"October 8, 2019","This was on our must-see list while in London but it wasn't as much of a hit with the group as we expected. The extra 'donation' cost caught us at the ticket booth - that seems to be common at a number of London attractions to automatically include it unless you ask to remove it (which then seems mean spirited).We visited midweek, off-peak season and it was still really busy. Loads of school groups too.A few of of the exhibits are fresh and attractive but others are tired. I visited a number of years ago and found the crown jewels a lot more attractive in how they were presented then.The higlight was the manager in the gift shop, she was chatty and knew lots - particularly about the ravens, more than was shared at the actual raven talk by one of the Yeoman Warders (who by his admission wasn't the Raven Master).",A London Must See
"October 7, 2019","We arrived in time to take an yeoman warder tour (free).  This tour lasts about 45 minutes and includes many stories and anecdotes.  Get the audio guide to complete the visit.  If the day is busy, go to the Crown Jewels first.  Be sure to visit the Bloody Tower.  Learn about the Ravens. We spent 4+ hours there, and there was still more that we could have done.",Good history! 
"October 7, 2019",Just visited the Tower of London and had a good time. The history was explained and lots of things to see. The royal jewels were great to see!,Beefeater tour was great!
"October 7, 2019",Had a great visit!  You must do a beefeater tour!!!  Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly was our guide and was fabulous. My 13 year old loved his stories and was amongst the first to follow him around the tower to hear his stories and history. It was great to be able to put some of the stories we heard on our tour with some of the other places we visited.,A must
"October 7, 2019","Didn’t have a lot of time here, wish we would have had more time to explore. We were later in the day arriving and they close up promptly at 5pm. Go early. The Crown Jewels are amazing and there is just so much history here.",Awesome History!
"October 7, 2019","We were pleasantly surprised that we did not have to wait in a line to get in.  We were able to join a Beefeater tour immediately. Although the history at the tower is quite gruesome, Spike made our tour fun.  The crown jewels were quite impressive but the collection seemed quite small.",Gruesome London Tower
"October 6, 2019","If you have any anticipated ideas on the Tower of London, you can be positively surprised when you actually visit it. The beefeaters are able to recreate a historical atmosphere that cannot be beaten. Besides, the traditions and real events seem just as real as a current affair.The crown jewels are of indelible value. Unforgettable experience indeed.",Interesting site tour
"October 6, 2019",I've been to the Tower of London a couple of times and have always found it interesting. Amazing history for you to see and experience. i suggest a tour guide who talks about all the nuances of the Tower and its history.,Amazing
"September 21, 2019",You need to spend at least 3 hours to take all in. It’s huge and gives you an insight on how life was  in 1200. The armoury is mind blowing as is the Crown Jewels. The beef eaters walk around to add to the atmosphere.,A must-see
"September 21, 2019","Thoroughly enjoyed touring the Tower of London.  We chose to tour on our own, but guided tours are also available.  Lots of history to see with the secession of Kings and queens.  The Crown Jewels were a highlight and a must-see!  The Tower should be on everyone’s list- and don’t miss the resident Ravens.  We used it as part of our London Pass- a great value also.",Amazing
"September 20, 2019",It’s history at its finest. So much to see and do. Loved the Ravens and their story. The Crown Jewels are not to be believed. Hard to believe such things exist. That the jewels are real. Loved everything about this historic landmark. ,Like history?  Go here!
"September 19, 2019","An amazing place to visit!  If you like to see old architecture, you will love seeing the buildings and the walls. In one building, you see the Crown Jewels and the information about each is placed next to them.  Very beautiful jewels!  In the White Wall Tower, you see the armor and shields of all the kings.  Also, you will see where Ann Boleyn was beheaded.  If you visit London, you must go here!",Tower of London 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
"September 19, 2019",Great tour. Could have spent all day here no problem. Crown Jewels a highlight. Well worth the money,Take the tour! 
"September 19, 2019","The Warder who led our tour was fabulous. Highlights are the stories behind each of the buildings and the execution history, as well as the royalty who resides here. One note: the glass coffee table that is supposed to be contemporary art in the place of the courtyard near the white tower - that thing has GOT TO GO! ",Clive was outstanding
"September 18, 2019","We loved our time at the Tower, but the highlight was our beefeater tour with Clive.

"September 18, 2019","We had a great afternoon! There are free guided tours every half hour and our guide was informative and funny. The guides are the ""Beefeaters"" dressed in their garb. The tour gives some history and gets you started and then you can wander wherever you want. The Crown Jewels are amazing. Plan on spending at least 3 hours and they close at 5:30pm.",History Buff Heaven!
"September 8, 2019","Every London tour guide will give you everything you want to know about the Tower, so here are just a few observations from a first-time visitor to England.First, it's a collection of towers and buildings inside a wall.  It's not just a single tower.  There's a lot to see and savor there; you could easily spend most of a day in there, but that's a big investment of time in what is usually a short/tight schedule.So, my recommendation is to get there before it opens and purchase your ticket either online prior or at the ticket counter there.  Go in, skip the Beefeater tour for now and go straight to the queue to see the Crown Jewels.  Trust me, it gets longer as the day goes on. [If you arrive in the afternoon in the summer, expect to spend well over an hour in line to see them.] The jewels are interesting and spectacular and displayed very well.  You MUST see them and they are included in your Tower ticket.After that, go back to the entrance gate and get into the next Beefeater tour.  The Beefeaters are selected from the military and live in the Tower.  They are very dedicated and thoroughly knowledgeable about British history.  Very interesting!During the day, little playlets spring up here and there, very nicely acted by folks in authentic garb.  They are designed to illustrate life as a prisoner there, the politics of the time, the differences in the classes in the 16th century, etc.  If you love history, you will want to follow the players around as they banter and bicker with each other, but it does eat up time.  You can wander as much as you want around the premises where some of the arguably most important events in Western history occurred!The inside of the Tower is not commercialized.  Because of that, they commendably don't have food franchises in there.  One tiny vendor sells sausage rolls, ice cream and soft drinks and the queue can be very long.  Do not arrive without having eaten if those choices don't appeal to you - or bring in some protein bars to snack on if you plan to be there a while!London has a thousand choices of sights to see, but I think the Tower has to rate in the top 5.If you arrive in the afternoon in the summer, expect to wait an   hour or more to see the Jewels.",Amazing
"September 8, 2019","There are guides inside and they were good. The guy, forgot to get his name, was excellent 👍 I actually wanted to buy the costumes for kids inside. It was just too bulky to bring home. Maybe another time ❤️ ",Arrive early to beat the crowds!
"September 7, 2019","Great visit.  Worth going early to beat the crowds- arrived at 8:30 and got in quickly when it opened at 9am.  Headed straight to the Crown Jewels which was a good move- got in quickly (the jewels are magnificent) and when I came out there was a long line already winding around.  There is so much history at the Tower of London...visited a few hours but really could have spent all day.  Take the free BeefEaters tour- presented by a royal guard, the tour is informative as well as humorous!",The Tower of London
"September 7, 2019","The Tower of London was one of the most interesting things I visited in London.  The history and architecture was amazing.  The Tower had several buildings inside of a moat.  Over the centuries, it was a treasury, a prison, and an armory - to name a few.  It had an area where you could see the Crown Jewels of England that were worn throughout the ages.  In addition, there were live guards outside that brought it to life.",Tower of London definitely a good visit
"September 7, 2019","The whole place was just brilliant.  The history, the armor, the weapons and the jewels definitely wow. Loved the experience, and was just incredible to see all the history in this place the good and the bad. To walk in the same grounds that so many famous people have walked was awesome.",Awesome but expensive
"September 7, 2019","Amazing experience at the Tower of London. Join a free tour with the hilarious tour guides, see the Crown Jewels and hear the amazing history. Leave A LOT of time to get your moneys worth from this visit... no fewer than 3 hours, but preferably 5-6. Be prepared for long (while moving lines). Took more than 45 min to get into the Crown Jewels. Be prepared for an expensive entrance fee if traveling as a family.

"September 6, 2019","This was my second visit to the Tower.  Although it is a tourist attraction, it is one everyone should go to.  The history, the jewels and more are very interesting.  It is more than just looking at ""items"", they explain the history that goes with them.",A good look of London’s history
"September 5, 2019","Very educational tour. Good to know the history of this tower at the dark past, as this is where torture happens when someone committed treason. I enjoyed the armory. But so sad I was not able to visit and see The Crown Jewels as I don’t have much time. I suggest go a bit early, you have to que for at least 2hrs if you go in the afternoon","One of my favorites in London for adults and adolescents (possibly children, as well)"
"September 2, 2019","Taking the Beefeater Tour (best to reserve in advance), I've always found this tour and grounds exceeded my expectations.   First, the Beefeater's who lead the tours are knowledgeable and humorous.  So many sights (i.e., the Crown Jewel's, place of many beheadings), to see and the Beefeaters are insightful and will answer our (oh, so many!) questions on the tour.   The armory and grounds have tell-abouts to complete the experience.    Up-to-date tour queries and jokes based on international goings-on.Give this tour 2-3 hours, partially with the Beefeater's tour guide and partially self-guided.  Amazing!",Must see sight

"September 2, 2019","Hearing about the ""Tower of London"" you think of just a tower, but it is much more.  We were surprised at how extensive the castle is and and had a great tour by one of the Beefeaters.  Yes the line is long, but don't miss the crown jewels.  What a unique view of British history and some amazing jewel uncrusted crowns and other regalia.Definitely worth your time.",Stunning!
"September 1, 2019","Loved the Crown Jewels!  Depending on the time of day and what day you go, there could be a very long line, but we lucked out and were in within 15 min!  The rest of the tower so much history tied to it, you can spend hours looking through the entire place.",Very cool and informative
"September 1, 2019","Lots to see here and quite interesting information.  Warning - LOTS of steps, but then, it is a castle.  Not many food choices - I didn't see any indoor options, just outside stalls.  Great ice cream though!",First trip to London
"September 1, 2019","We both loved it, a lot of stairs I mean a lot, white tower has 204.   But great history information, everyone was nice,  food ok, view of Thames River and large buildings around the area.   Raven everywhere, I went August 31st a Saturday and was not crowded, I read go to grown Jewels first, which we did, and I was so glad, as later in the day, line was long, but we had no line.   ",Be sure to go early
"August 31, 2019","Arrive early for two reasons. First to see the queens keys to the tower delivered so the tower can be opened (this tradition is hundreds of years old). Second, there will not be a line for the crown jewels. Be sure and do the beefeater tour in the tower. They start at 10 am. See the crown jewels first thing at 9am before the beefeater your and you will miss the very long lines that develop rather quickly around 10am. Finally, don't miss seeing the tower. It's fully worth the time.",The Tower Embodies England's History
"August 30, 2019","The Tower is one of the most iconic places to visit in London, but it also provides a sweeping history of England in one place.  Yes, there are always crowds, but it's worth it to set foot on this place which has been so significant for several thousand years.  We were fortunate to be able to also go into the chapel where many notable people are buried.  If you only have time to see a few places in London, see the Tower!",Bit Disappointed 
"August 29, 2019","I visited the Tower of London as an educational visit for my grandson. It was a bit disappointing to say the least. I was trying to fire in him my love of  history! Unfortunately this fell flat as the whole experience felt like a bit of a tourist experience rather than a visit to one of our most beloved historic monuments!  I visited this when I was 11 years old and it inspired me , gave me a real pride in my country and heritage; this failed to hit the mark with my grandson! This just bored  him and left me feeling that we have sold our soul to commerciality! Very disappointed as I had really bigged up the visit! He actually preferred the London Dungeon! Come on?",A Wonderful experience
"August 29, 2019","We visited the place in July 19. Online booking of tickets help since there are large queues at the ticket window. Recommend to start the tour of Tower of London early in the morning before the crowd starts . Since there is a big queue for the Crown Jewels viewing ,it is better to start  the tour with the Crown jewels and then explore the grounds of the Tower at leisure.  Later in the day there are serpentine queues for the Crown Jewels. The viewing takes about 3 hours . Do not miss the Ravens and the Traitors Gate which are a part of the Tower History.",You have to see this!!
"August 25, 2019","If you don't see anything else in London, you have to see this!!  amazing history with displays (both interactive and static displays).  Great architecture, amazing views and a decent cafe.  The lines to the crown jewels are REALLY long!  Most of the other displays have standard wait times, so nothing too long.  If you can, listen to/watch some of the demonstrations/talks that the people who work there give.  VERY interesting history!  If you fly through (and not see the crown jewels), you can probably get through it in about 1 1/2 hours.  If you enjoy history and read most of the display information (and see the crown jewels) you could be there at least 7-8 hours.  Definitely, worth the visit!",Tower tips
"August 23, 2019","The Tower of London is a great day out but you need to be prepared for long queues and lots of stairs to climb. Get there early to avoid the very long lines that build up to see the Crown Jewels. Also take a tour with one of the beef eater guides,these are always informative and entertaining. There are photo opportunities with actors in period costumes.Signage isn’t great to locate toilets, especially for ladies but they are there just not well signposted.",Stunning
"August 23, 2019","Recommend good walking shoes and going to see the Crown Jewels first thing when they open at 10 am because the line get be very long.  There are no photos allowed of the Crown Jewels.  There is a movie clip from Queen Elizabeth's coronation.  Then you get to see the 3 largest diamonds in the world, the largest ruby and emerald and some of the largest pearls.The Tower has a rich history.  The Yeoman Warders are amazingly knowledgeable.  You should read about the Tower before you go and see it.  You can spend half a day at the Tower.  There is also an amazing view of Tower Bridge.  Some areas are not handicap accessible and you can't bring a stroller.  There are a lot of stairs in some parts of the Tower.  You can also see the Changing of the Guard.  Smaller scale than Buckingham Palace, easier to see.",Must do whilst in London
"August 19, 2019","We stayed in London for 5 days and went on many tours and saw a lot of sights...hands down this was the best place we visited.We pre-booked our tickets in Australia and glad we did. No queues. Note: Arrive when the gates open, head straight to Crown Jewels to have a look otherwise you will be queuing for some time. After the crown jewels we followed the Yeoman warden on the 9.30am tour. Brilliant... So informative, fascinating yet witty. Don't skip doing this...only goes for 30 mins or so but you learn so much history. Make sure you give yourself at least 3 hours at the Tower. Such a great day.",Awesome experience - lots to see and even more to learn
"August 19, 2019","We went to the Tower of London not knowing what to expect and got a whole lot more than we expected. We went on a tour and had the opportunity to see the opening ceremony - highly recommend this. If you can't do this, then use the London Pass or other mechanism to ""skip"" the long lines and at least get to the front in a shorter line. There is so much to see and there are free tours that you can join (check the website). The Crown Jewels are awesome - warning there is another line and if you are interested in seeing them, highly recommend going in as early as possible. The armor collection was fascinating and presented in such a way that you can't help learning about London's history. There are a number of things to watch: the ravens, the mesh wire sculptures representing gifts from other kingdoms, the Beefeaters, etc, We spent several hours here and it felt like we were only there for a few minutes. We will definitely go back because there is so much to see and learn.",Don’t miss this!
"August 19, 2019","Even in the rain, we loved the ToL!  Definitely recommend to go first thing in the morning and head to the Crown Jewels right away. We waited in a very long queue to see them and felt a bit like herded sheep lol. The audio guide was great and allowed you to select the tour you wanted to follow depending upon how much time you have. If you only visit one place in London, it should be this!",Excellent tour
"August 19, 2019",We visited the Tower of London during our recent stay in London and what a magnificent tourist site this is We could have spent many hours wandering around the expansive grounds but accomplished what we could whilst there - I do think you need to allow at least 2-4 hours to do this venue justice We joined the beefeater tour when we arrived and that was very well done and quite humorous as well.We also were keen to see the Crown Jewels and joined the long line ... however the line moves very quickly and within 25 minutes we were inside . well worth the wait to see the magnificent Crown Jewels and you also learn a little of the history as well The views of tower bridge are amazing from the tower walls and offer many photo opportunities A great place to visit and one for everyone’s to do list whilst in London,A must see
"August 18, 2019",The Tower of London is a must see for anyone visiting London. Lots of interesting history and who doesn’t want to see the Crown Jewels,Lot's of history
"August 18, 2019","Tons of people come through here and they do a decent job of getting everyone in and out. Definitely recommend investing in renting the guide tablet with headphones so you know what you're looking at. Get there early, plan to spend 3-4 hours there, and if you really want to see the crown jewels, do those early because the line gets huge (hour wait) in the middle of the day.",Fabulous
"August 18, 2019",The tower was completely different than I thought it would be. So glad we went! Seeing the apartments brought history to life. We met beefeaters and saw the Crown Jewels. Fascinating way to spend 2-3 hours.,Brill trip and guided tour!
"November 11, 2021","We had a brilliant trip to the Tower of London. We did the guided tour by beefeater 409 who was a brilliant and funny guide, and we throughly enjoyed learning the history!",Beefeater 403 !!! The tour to have
"November 8, 2021",Got a bogof online! had to produce train tickets on arrival. DEF join a beefeater tour ! 403 was the best ! Hilarious engaging and extremely informative. He must surely be the best guide! We had a fab 3 hours there. Quiet friday morning! Thanks,So  much history!
"November 8, 2021",Learned so  much  more than I expected.  Wild animal roaming the grounds!  Tower within a tower within a tower!  Actual crown jewels on  location.  Ravens too!,From the outside 
"November 8, 2021",One of the iconic sites if London on the banks of the Thames. I walked round as not open at the time I visited but still a thrill to see the tower ,Love the History
"November 7, 2021",So interesting.  We loved all the history.  Lots of opportunities for some great photos.  Plan to spend at least an hour or more.,Tower of London visit
"November 7, 2021","Great place to visit. Lots of British and Tower history given by the Beefeater guides. Many different museums, with a variety of artifacts such as swords, armour,  crown jewels, beefeater history, white tower and beautiful small chapel.",Tower
"November 7, 2021",We took our two grandsons and they loved it they were very interested in all the armour and guns etc they are 9&7,Tower of London
"November 7, 2021","This was a great experience from booking the tickets, paying and redeeming the tickets it was easy and hassle free, I would definitely use head out again!",Wonderful day out
"November 7, 2021","We came for the first time and it was amazing, the walkways and different rooms are steeped in so much history. The Crown Jewels were gorgeous, absolutely incredible! I completely fell in love with the ravens too. All in all fantastic day! Will definitely return!!",Take the tour!
"November 6, 2021","We went on the free tour around the Tower which was so informative and so well told. I learnt so much, in such a fun and informative way.",Tower of London
"August 7, 2019","Going on a Saturday in Summer holidays I knew it would be busy but wow I think half of London was there. Beefeater Tour was informative but too many people so we opted to view the Crown Jewels. The queue was 30 minutes but well worth it. The queue after we came out was 1 hour, not ideal in the heat. We spent 3 hours in total and could have spent longer.",Family Trip
"August 7, 2019","We got there a little before 9 and waited in line for the Tower of London to open. We went straight to the Crown Jewels upon opening. The line was virtually non-existent for the jewels. We then returned to the front for the yeoman tour. However, there were SO many people for the tour, it was hard to get close enough to hear him. We wound up dropping out of the tour by the second stop.",Great place to see some royal stuff!!
"August 7, 2019",You must get here early...they start queuing up by mid morning and there is not a lot of shade in the outside line! Totally worth visiting as you can see a large assortment of the Royal Crown Jewels! Bonus...the guards outside are a hoot!! ,Fascinating look at London's history
"August 6, 2019","There is so much to see at the Tower of London. Do yourself a favour and join a guided tour - it's well worth doing to get a glimpse into the history of the tower and how it operates today. Be prepared for crowds and queues into the Crown Jewels by going earlier in the day, especially if you plan to go in peak season. I spent a few hours here exploring and really enjoyed the experience.",Fantastic!
"August 5, 2019","This was a great place to spend a good portion of a day. There was lots to see and we tired before we ran out of things to see.  It's a great place for families!  There can be lots of climbing and going down stairs and some areas might be difficult to transverse, but there is something here for everyone to enjoy.  There are also places to get food and drinks when hungry. We actually had no idea how large and accessible the Tower of London was, and that it's actually a huge castle and beautiful grounds. A ""must see"" in London! ",Yeoman’s Tour
"August 5, 2019","My 20 year old daughter and I found the Tower of London fascinating, although a bit gruesome.  The highlight was the Yeoman Warder’s Tour by Scott Kelley!  Even with quite a crowd around him, he projected his voice and kept everyone engaged.  We learned a lot!","Fantastic, something for everyone!"
"August 5, 2019","Really, timing is everything. Just took our kids and it was an absolute zoo, but they loved it. We (my husband and I) have been during the Fall and Spring, and there were zero lines, so that is the hard part about summer vacation. However, there really is something for everyone and I think boys and girls of all ages will enjoy it! Note, we went earlier in the day and the lines were significantly even longer when we left for a late lunch. Eat on the tower side for lunch, we made the mistake of walking across the bridge after to look for lunch and avoid some of the crowd, but there weren’t nearly as many options.",GIve yourself a full day
"August 5, 2019","Do not miss this, the Yeoman tour is fun and informative as are the other interactive tours. We didn't give ourselves enough time. To really get the most allow yourselves a full day. Andy was out Yeoman and he was brilliant, sorry Andy can't remember your last name. Can't recommend highly enough","Not a castle, but worth it!"
"August 4, 2019","London Tower is old. True! But apart from housing kings was also a prision and was built over the centuries. Dont expect a castle, BUT performers are all over the place telling the stories that happenned there. Walk around the wall and towers is cool. If you want to see the royal guards really close, this is the place. They are protecting the Royal Jewels that are exposed in this monument.",Good History Lesson
"August 3, 2019",Our family really enjoyed The Tower of London tour. There was a great deal of history to learn. The exhibits were well done. It paid off to get there early.,Do the Yeoman Tour 
"August 2, 2019","We went just to see the Crown Jewels and ended up on the Yeoman tour.  Our guide was Scott Kelly, one of the youngest Beefeaters (#409) and by his own admission the most handsome. He was quite humorous (given the subject matter of The Tower) and knowledgeable.  Loved the tour and learning the history of The Tower. The grounds are easy to navigate as our the buildings. The ravens flying and squawking about are entertaining too.",Come early
"August 1, 2019",Come as early as you can and go all over the walls - so you can watch everything calmly. Next up - Crown Jewels. So in about 2 hours you will see everything before the arrival of the large masses of tourists.,What a place!
"July 31, 2019","I wasn't sure what to expect when my wife told me we had to go here. Wow! I was impressed. Walking audio tour was great! Listening to the yeoman warders at various points throughout was great! My son got recruited into one of the skits they were doing, which you guessed it, was great! Royal Armoury was impressive. I would say the only thing that didn't blow me away was the crown jewels, but it was still good to see them. We spent probably 4 or 5 hours here and enjoyed all of it!",Amazing!!
"July 30, 2019",Allow yourself a good 3 hours to visit the Tower of London.  It truly is a national treasure.  The tours and guides are amazing and there is so much history you will definitely learn a thing or two.  ,Worth a visit when in London but not for little children
"July 30, 2019","The title of the review is self explanatory. Let me put it this way. Do not take the children on the Beefeater tour (even though it is included in the entry ticket) for this place has one bloody history and the Beefeaters I suspect secretly enjoy recounting all that morbid history in graphic detail.  It seriously has one bloody history. It is therefore quite fitting that all the loot from the various nations including the Kohinoor from India and the Cullinan and the Star of Africa are displayed here in all its glory. As an aside, it definitely represents a very important part of the English history and is worth a visit.",Must See!
"July 29, 2019","The Tower of London is a must see! You should plan on spending around 3 hours touring the grounds and plan for a lot of stairs if you want to see it all. Also, I highly recommend you getting there right when it opens as it get very busy in the afternoons and the line for the Crown Jewels can be extremely long. We went first thing in the morning and didn't have to wait at all!",Wonderful tour and experience 
"July 28, 2019",The warders tour is awesome and the overall tour was well worth the price of admission. Would recomend booking in advance for groups to save a few £.,Great museum for good weather
"July 27, 2019","The museum was very entertaining for my nieces (7 & 10), my brother and myself (30s), and our parents (70s).We arrived at 2pm and there was no line to get in.  It was crowded on the inside, but the interior courtyard is large so it was still easy to get around.  There were lines for some of the main exhibits on the inside, mainly for the crown jewels.  The crown jewels line moved fast though and was worth the wait.The free Yeomen Warders tour they give ever half hour or so are very entertaining.  I would plan to start with this tour and then go off and see all the exhibits after.  Give yourself 3 hours to be safe, if your are with kids you may need a little more time.",Worth going to for a history lesson
"July 27, 2019","Went a on a Saturday in July. Need less to say, very crowded including tour groups. If you can stomach the crowds, it is worth going to. A Yeoman Warner tour (free with admission) was entertaining and informative. There is a lot to see here so read up ahead of time to pick what you want to see. Come early if you want to see the Crown Jewels, line was very long in the hot sun. We skipped it.The walk along the wall was interesting to give an overview of the place. The White tower museum has lots of arms and armor and also lots of steps.Would come back on a less crowded day to see the stuff we missed.",Amazing! 
"July 25, 2019","My family and I went here during our two day stay in London and it’s was absolutely fabulous! We purchased the London Passes and were brought straight in with no wait at all! There was a line for the Crown Jewels but the conveyer belts in front of them kept the line moving swiftly. All of the staff was more than kind and there were even some historically dressed employees performing re-enactments throughout the castle. The grounds were not overly crowded, so there was plenty of room to walk around and sit and relax between walking through the grounds. Overall the rooms were very nice and the signs were translated to many languages as to accommodate many people from many different regions, which is more than I can say about other historic castles, such as Versailles in France. It definitely takes a few hours to see everything, but it is well worth it! I definitely recommend this castle and would 100% return! ",Wished we had more time.
"July 25, 2019","We went as part of a full day tour with many other stops, so we really only had less than two hours. We waited in line for at least 30 minutes to see the crown jewels. I feel like we needed at least another hour or more to see everything. There is a lot of history to see here. Would definitely recommend a visit.","The good, bad and ugly of England’s past"
"July 25, 2019","Only had a 2.5hr slot so we had to be choosy about what we went to - in truth you could spend the best part of a day exploring (which would make the price more palatable). Started with the tour which was well worth it (get close so you can hear clearly) - v knowledgeable and friendly guide. Then saw Crown Jewels (big queue but moved v quickly so we were in in minutes), the white tower armoury (cool weapons) and the torture instruments in the base of the tower. Fascinating stuff. My main improvement would be to bring in digital tickets (you HAVE to have a printed one) - as antiquated as the venue!!",Ravens!
"July 25, 2019","Enjoyed a guided tour of the Tower of London -- two highlights: seeing the famous Tower Ravens and the Crown Jewels. Imagine a diamond the size of my fist! The architecture is gorgeous, the museums fascinating. Well worth the visit. ",Amazing
"July 24, 2019","We only spent 3 hours here, not enough time to fully immerse ourselves. Crown jewels exhibit was breathtaking ",Really good
"July 24, 2019",Very informative the people were so helpful and we all enjoyed the experience. Well worth a visit!!It got a little pushy in the Crown Jewels but that’s people who are pushy and not the attractions fault. ,Don't book through Viator - book directly with location!
"July 23, 2019","We weren't able to get to the Tower of London on the day that I had I purchased our tickets for, so I called Viator to see if we could transfer to the next day. They told me they would have to hear from the property. I called the property and they said no problem just to tell Viator it was ok but after three phone calls and speaking to various ""customer service"" reps, Viator would not accept that. So, we lost the $105 we spent on tickets and never saw the Tower of London. London is a huge city that is difficult to navigate and the last tour runs at 5 so if you are stuck in traffic or you've had to alter plans due to an unforeseen circumstance, you are stuck. You are better off to buy them directly through the Tower of London for that day.",An incredible look into history 
"July 23, 2019","As someone who likes attractions a bit more off the beaten path, I was taken aback by how much I enjoyed visiting. To avoid the crowds at the Crown Jewels we arrived about ten minutes before opening in the morning and were promptly let in. We got through without any line. The other parts of the Tower were fascinating and much less crowded as the day went on than the Crown Jewels (By mid morning the line to see them wrapped nearly around the whole courtyard!). There also appeared to be many family friendly aspects of the grounds as well. ",It's Not a Tower
"July 23, 2019",Just a bit of humor.  The Tower of London grounds is an interesting spot with a complex and varied history. It has been more than just a place where disfavored royals were imprisoned.  I recall watching The White Princess with young Edward V & his brother disappearing after being imprisoned by their Uncle. It was seriously moving (surprisingly so) when they pointed out the spot where a 150 or so years later workmen found the skeletons of two boys in a box under a staircase.,A must visit 
"July 23, 2019","England is full of interesting history and the Tower of  London is a must visit. Viewing the crown jewels is worth the visit alone. And the tower bridge is right next to door, so include in your itinerary ",Brilliant family day out
"July 22, 2019","Fun for all ages. We really enjoyed ourselves and you can take a picnic which helps cut down costs, Often do special kids events in holidays. We bought a Historical Royal Palaces card as one off payment gives access to other sites for a year and loved idea of popping into Tower to drool over Crown Jewels as often as we wanted. Watch out for queues in July and August and buy tickets online.",Tip - do not order tickets online
"July 14, 2019","We are visiting on a summer weekend, so it’s a busy day. We ordered our tickets online. However, we don’t have a printer, so we had to choose “collect at the office” (they don’t allow mobile vouchers at this time). We figured this would be quick. The line for people to pick up online tickets is longer and slower than the lines to just buy the tickets here on site. If you have access to a printer, buy online and print the tickets and you can avoid all the ticket lines. If you don’t have access to a printer, buy the tickets on-site. ",Very entertaining 
"July 13, 2019","We had a tour guide and we had also read a couple books about the Tower of London so I can't say it'd be the same if you went unguided without any prior knowledge. But it was fascinating and my kids aged 10 and 8 loved it. There is talk of executions and torture and other gruesome acts so be sure your kids can stomach that without being upset. The Crown Jewels are worth the price of admission alone but arrive early and go straight there as that area gets very busy. I do recommend a guide if it's in the budget. They can tailor your tour to you. Toned down for kids and fully gruesome for the lovers of gore and everything in between. If you can't afford a tour or can't get one, the Yoemen or Beefeaters give complementary tours at set intervals throughout the day. They only have a couple of stops outside a few towers. Maybe 5 in total and get quite crowded but certainly an excellent alternative if you can't get a private/semi private guide.",So expensive
"July 10, 2019"," A classic London tourist attraction. It's £30.30 per adult ..Inc a ""voluntary"" donation. Minus donation is £27.50.Women at the ticket office treats you like dirt. I think its a little audacious to then have further donation boxes around every corner. We were there middle of the week during school holidays. Swapped with school groups. ",Stay waiting on Cruise
"July 10, 2019","After arriving early, waiting for the start of our cruise we took the tube from Heathrow tube stop to the Tower of London.  It is easy to get to but did have to change trains to get there. We purchased the tickets on line, saving both money and time. There was no queues and we walked in on arrival. We found the tour fascinating and enjoyed seeing the Crown Jewels; however the line to enter the building was slow moving. Also, no pictures were allowed in the vault and was enforced. We were able to see and exit accross from the London Bridge, giving us some great pictures.",Avoid Monday mornings 
"July 10, 2019","Monday’s they open at 10am as appose to 9am so people forget this and queue up from 9am, so when the gates open your in the queue for hours just to get in - we initially got there at 10am on Monday and was told the wait time was over an hour to get in Tips 1. Go between Tue-Sat (opens at 9am) and be there 15-30 minute in advance to queue2. Pre book your ticket online from their website (it’s also cheaper than buying it there) 3. Head straight to the Crown Jewels as that is what has the longest queue once inside the premise. (no pictures allowed) 4. Once inside, Some sites inside do not allow the pram / stroller or is not practical with a pram / stroller as your required to take the stairs  (so have to leave the pram outside the door) ",Get There Early
"July 8, 2019",I loved visiting this place.  Such history!  But why is it called the Tower when it is more like a complex of towers and buildings?  I underestimated how long it would take me to explore.I didn't get to see the Queen's Jewels as I arrived in the afternoon and line for those was already several hours long.  I would suggest going to that building first when you arrive and doing tours/rest afterwards.  I did manage to make the climb up to top of the White Tower in the center to see a Norman church built there.  It was simple yet gorgeous and so worth the climb.Also make sure to buy your ticket from somewhere that gives you a skip the line option.  I don't think London Pass offers that.  I bought a voucher from travel stand outside tube station which I took straight to group tickets and got in quickly.  Several tour guides mention this place so check it out.  Also it was easy to reach via water taxi.  I took the Thames Clipper from Westminster Pier.  It was a lovely ride.Enjoy Your Trip!,Just ok
"July 8, 2019","Once you get it, find out how long the wait is to see the crown jewels. We originally were going to take a Beefeater tour but one of the Beefeaters told us it was only a 20 minutes wait to see the Jewels. So we skipped the tour and went to see the Jewels. Thank goodness. When we came out the line was a mile long. We then went back to the entrance and picked up a tour. Probably saved us two hours.",Must See
"July 8, 2019",This Building justifies the accolades it receives.Visited this building some years ago but the present layout of the exhibition areas is much better.Stayed in Citizen M hotel opposite therefore visited early & avoided the queues.Did Not do the Audio Tour.Beefeater talks worth listening to.View from Bedroom,Must see if in London
"July 8, 2019","The Tower of London is a must!  We spent more than 4 hours exploring and still missed a couple of towers. The “Beefeaters” introduction is excellent. I would strongly recommend the audio tour.  The history is fantastic!  The Crown Jewels are spectacular!  If you only have time to visit a couple of sites while in London, I would make this the number one place to see.",Tower IceCream
"July 7, 2019",The Tower of London is well worth a visit - the queue can be long to get in but they process admissions pretty quickly.  You get a map of the entire layout and can go whereever you choose.  The Crown Jewels are absolutely amazing and so is the phenomenal array of Gold and China tableware.  The history is really interesting and the IceCream is delicious!!,Loved the Tower - Hated the Lines!
"July 6, 2019","First the good.  Our family really enjoyed our visit to the Tower of London.  There is a ton to see and a great deal of history within the walls.  We went just after opening and immediately went to see the Crown Jewels and had only a 10-15 minute wait to get in.  We went on the Beefeater Tour and our guide was excellent.  Funny, informative and good for both adults and kids.  We only had about 3 hours and could have used another hour to really see everything.  Definitely a must visit sight for anyone coming to London.The bad.  This ticket does NOT allow you to bypass the entrance line.  It ONLY allows you to bypass the ticket line.  When we got there the ticket lines were not that long and I'm not sure that this really had any value to us.  The line to enter the Tower was probably 1/3 of a mile long.  My wife and son got in line as soon as we arrived while my daughter and I got in line to get our tickets.  By the time we got our tickets (20-30 minutes) they were almost to the entrance and then we got right in.  It might have been that we were there when the Tower opened.  The lines to enter did not seem quite as bad when we left in the early afternoon.  Also, the Beefeater Tour is great but its not a private tour.  Our tour had around 50-60 people.  The guide managed it all very well and made sure we all could see and hear him but don't think you're getting a special tour with this ticket.  Overall, everyone should visit the Tower of London.  It's a fantastic part of London's history.  But be prepared for long lines and be aware of what this ticket is and is not.",Too crowded
"July 2, 2019","It was so below my expectations. The truth is what you see outside is what you get because its basically empty and way too crowded. Crown jewels and armor room are probably the best. Maybe I should have waited for the yeoman warder tour, because If you go on your own practically you dont get a clue of what the tower really was",The Tower of London
"July 2, 2019","This was my number 1 on the list for London and it did not disappoint. From the Crown Jewels. The Beefeaters, the ravens, the history of the place, it was wonderful. Do not miss this if you are going to London.",Very Interesting!
"July 2, 2019",There was so much to see it took the better part of the day so don't rush through.  And don't miss the Crown Jewels even if the line is long!  Jaw dropping!  ,Was I tired of museums?
"June 29, 2019",Perhaps I was tired of museums and audio guides but I didn’t enjoy the Tower of London as much as I thought I might. This tour might be great for medieval history buffs or royal watchers with a fascination for the Crown Jewels but it didn’t grab my attention. ,Landmark heavy on history
"June 26, 2019","The waiting lines may seem scary but they move rather quickly, just make sure you are waiting in the right one because the staff is not very helpful. Walking in this place you can feel the history, although I do feel they could have made a better presentation out of it. Wear comfortable shoes.",Insight into the mechanics
"June 25, 2019",Thoroughly enjoyed this tour to witness the mechanics up close on the bridge's operational features. Excellent how incorporating modern features of glass floor above Thames to capture events below. One of the best gift souvenir shops we uncovered at the end of tour . Quick exit back to Hop on off bus tour stop. Worth the entry for sure,Lousy cancellation plan.
"June 24, 2019","Tried to cancel one day ahead, no refunds. Travel companion was sick.  Lousy cancellation policy.  Out 100 pounds.....",The White Tower and Crown Jewels were amazing
"June 24, 2019",We arrived at 9:30 am on Sunday morning and waited in the group ticket line.  At 10 am they opened the ticket booths and the line moved quick.  They took our vouchers and gave us printed tickets.  The line to get into the tower gates was very long and it took another 25 minutes to get in.  Once in side you have to pay 5 pounds if you want audio guides.  We then waited another 20 minutes in another line for the crown jewels but it was worth it.  They were amazing to see and the flow of people moves well once inside.  The white tower was also amazing to see all the amour of past kings and other historical items.  The only thing we would do different is not go early in the morning since once we got outside the gates there we no lines any more.,A great way to spend half a day!
"June 24, 2019","This was a very interesting place to visit. We took the free guided tour that was included in the price of our ticket and it was great! Our guide was funny and very passionate about his job! Learnt a lot about the history of the castle and heard some crazy stories. Would certainly recommend going to London Tower. Oh and make sure you go and see the Crown Jewels, they were unbelievable!","Torture, Crown Jewels and More"
"July 22, 2019",A must see on a visit to London. Much more than a simple tower. It includes a medieval fortress that became the home to many an outlaw in their last days. It is currently the home of the Crown Jewels and their guardians.,Crown Jewels the highlight.
"July 22, 2019","You can’t take pix of the Crown Jewels, but gotta love the bling. The Royal Guardsman were disciplined since it was hot as hell at the time, but they looked crisp.",Great for London history 
"July 21, 2019",TOL should be on the list for any history buff or first time visitor to London. Easy to get to and so much history. A great place to spend 2-4 hours. Lines are long during peak times.,Booked the Yeoman Warders tour but explored the Tower on our own
"July 21, 2019","We were six people with four of them not having seen the Tower before. We booked the Yeoman Warder Tour but as you can see in the picture, several hundred London Tourists had the same idea, so we decided to explore the Tower and the Crown Jewels on our own.",Tower of London is remarkable.  Historic.  
"July 21, 2019",If you are in London and you have never been to the TOL you must go!   It really brings all the history and stories of the Royalty of London to life.   Amazing preservation.    And you can also take a look at the crown jewels which not only shows  the jewels up close.  But also pictures of the Royal Family wearing the items.  Notes:   Buy tickets in advance.   And you must print them in advance.   They only take paper.  They do not accept electronic pdf.  Do the Beefeater tour.   The guides have great stories.  They are funny and it’s a great introduction to get started on your exploration.  The Crown Jewels que appears long but it moves along quite fast.  There is an ice cream booth next to the line.   So a good time for desert while waiting.   Wear shoes that will handle a lot of walking on cobblestones. They close at 530.  And last visitors let in at 5.   They are very strict of their rules.  Good luck and have fun!! Follow us  @nickellfamilytravel,U like history ?
"July 19, 2019",Just love .. cant say anything more.. just love it..  well needed 100 words. SoIf are in london on vacation this need to be on the top of the list no mather what 🥰🥰🍺✈🤘🤘,Fantastic experience 
"July 18, 2019","What a great visit. The Tower of London was so much more than I expected. The Crown Jewels were spectacular. As many others have recommended, go there first. We visited on a Thursday and got there shortly after opening. We didn’t have a line at al to pick up online tickets that we purchased, we didn’t have any wait for the Crown Jewels or any other area. There was so much to see. The views from it some were wonderful. There are a lot of stairs, so be aware of that if that is a concern. ",Ravenmaster was an excellent tour guide.
"July 18, 2019","We had Beefeater Mr. Chris Skaife, the Ravenmaster, as our tour guide. What absolute luck! He was so animated, informative, and fun. He wrote a great children's book sold in the shop there. We all learned a lot, had some laughs, and even got to see the Crown Jewels, which are not always on display. The moving carpet allowed us to circle around and take a closer look at the spectacular pieces a few times. Take the guided smaller tour by a Beefeater if you go - it is well worth it. Book early, and choose the earliest time to avoid the crowds and selling out. ",A jewel of a visit
"July 16, 2019","What a lovely day to visit the Tower of London!!  Our main purpose in going was to see the Crown Jewels and we were not disappointed. The line appeared to be long when we arrived but as lines go, this one moved quickly.  In no time we were in the building and winding our way around to see the jewels. They were spectacular and worth every minute of waiting which ended up being only 15-20 minutes. We were allowed to stay as long as we liked and didn’t feel rushed at all. There were lots of people there but we didn’t feel crowded. One hint for the restrooms...the ones at the ticket booth cost money to enter while the ones inside cost nothing to use. The gift shops are nice but each have different items so if you see something that you want, buy it so you don’t have to backtrack.   Tower of London is a “must do” while visiting London.","Entertaining tour, crown jewels and morbid history"
"July 14, 2019","We went to see the crown jewels but received much, much more.  The included guided tour by a Yeoman Warder was fantastic.  These are real soldiers that live on site.  They share much of the history of the tower.  We had no idea so many things happened here over history.  The crown jewels were beautiful but the tour overshadowed them.  We arrived early so it wasn't too crowded seeing the crown jewels.  Our bus driver gave us the tip to see the crown jewels first then join a tour at the entrance.   The display of military weapons may be the most interesting ever.  A must see while in London but plan to stay awhile.",Great visit
"June 23, 2019","It was amazing to see the crown jewels!   The beefeaters were friendly and would answer any questions as well as allow pictures with them to be taken.  No pictures are allowed of the crown jewels, however can take plenty of the grounds and the guards and the beefeaters.  They had nice gift shops also.  There is a river cruise right about this also.",Excellent
"June 23, 2019","Arrived just as it opened, long line even then. The Crown Jewels are here however it's a small collection and no photography allowed. It was interesting to see all the history. Glad we arrived early because it got very crowded when we left by 11am.",Must see
"June 23, 2019","The Tower of London is a compound in the middle of London.  We took an early tour.  I highly recommend going early to avoid the crowds and see the beefeaters opening.  While the Crown Jewels section is small, it is very impressive.  This is the only section were pictures are not allowed.  There are multiple buildings to tour with paintings, weaponry, knights and some interactive games.  The ravens that live on property are very large. There are many things to see and plenty of photo opportunities.",Favorite sight!
"June 22, 2019","This was one of our favorite sights in the UK!! So rich in history and so wonderfully preserved! We used the audio tour, which I would highly recommend unless you know your history very well! We learned alot and couldn't believe the collections of historical pieces here. Make sure you get there at least 30 minutes before opening and get your tickets ahead of time. Once inside, get your audio tour headphones and head directly to the crown jewels! If you wait, the queue will be VERY long. We saw the jewels without waiting and were finished quickly so we could spend the rest of our time in the other areas. Who wants to wait 2 hours in a queue?!",Annual family day out. The culture bit.
"June 22, 2019",Bought tickets in advance. Was a beautiful day and thankfully no queuing to get in. Caught the tour for 11.30 with the beefeater. Far too many people gathered around to be able to hear. It needs to be kept in lower numbers. Beefeater Steve was  wet amusing when you could hear him. Halfway through wandered off a bit as just couldn’t make out what was being said. Lovely place to visit but needs more to control numbers do people benefit from the tours.,Very Cool
"June 22, 2019","Very glad we visited the Tower.   They offer guided tours given by a Beefeater, the talks are funny and informative.  Check the schedule when you get there it it worth it and is included in your admission.  We did the audio tour as well ( separate fee) but the Beefeater tour was much better.   The crown jewels are a must see while you are there but it can get a bit crowded.  You can spend more time there than you think, give yourself plenty of time.  Great views of Tower Bridge from the Tower Courtyard.  ",Absolutely fantastic! 
"June 21, 2019","Went with my two boys ages 3 & 6, & they both LOVED it! Friendly employees all around. There was a very kind gentleman who sat in an information booth around the middle of the grounds and gave my boys each a cute little button that said “I escaped the tower” (or something very close to that). So cute! And they thought they were hot stuff! There are also great views of The Shard and Tower Bridge from within & you can skip the ticket line with your London Pass. This was my absolute favorite thing in London!!! ",Tower of London
"June 21, 2019",Great place! Ideally you’ll need at least two hours at the tower... if I had the time I wild have stayed longer. The history is fascinating!,This place worth to visit
"June 21, 2019","I been in London many times. This time finally decide visit Tower of London as well. I really saticfy with time I spent there. Very good was 45 min tour with guide. Guide was very professional, told many interesting facts about the history. After this guide tour we took time to look around our own and buildings, exebithions were more interesting. I honestly recomend to start visit of tower with this guide tour.",So much amazing history!!
"June 21, 2019","I read many travel blogs in preparation for our visit to Tower of London, most of which said to plan to spend 3 hours or so. I felt like we could have planned an entire day! We arrived on a Sunday morning at 9:15am and were within the first 30 or so people in line, which quickly grew to hundreds. Upon entry, we went straight to the Crown Jewels, then doubled back for the Yeoman Warder guided tour. I do not remember his name, but he was fantastic! We will visit again on our next trip to London and plan to spend an entire day here. ",Plan to spend the day
"June 15, 2019","There is so much to see, plan to spend the day, or at least several hours. Avoid weekends, seriously crowded",American mom and 12 year old son
"June 15, 2019",Entertaining visit. Lots to see and set up so you climb stairs for different towers.  Good activity for my tween. Ate fish and chips outside the entrance. Tasty and quick for my son. We split one order and it was plenty. Catch the line for the  Crown Jewels early. It gets longer as the day progresses. ,Europe 2019
"June 15, 2019","This was a definite must. It was only a 2 minute walk from our hotel and our daughter enjoyed this immensely. Two tips are to check the lines early...they can get very long very fast. Once inside, find your way to the Crown Jewels exhibit first, before the lines there get long..We got in almost immediately, but within 30-45 minutes of our finishing the line was an hour to get into this part of the location. Take your time and plan at least a half a day for this location. definitely worth the time.",Great historic site
"June 15, 2019","Really enjoyed our visit, the displays of the knight armor in the White Tower are excellent. The Crown Jewels of course were stunning. (You can circle back in the room and view the Crown Jewels as many times as you’d like). We visited on Wednesday this week on a rainy overcast day so the wait for the Crown Jewels was under 15 minutes. View of the Tower Bridge from there are also beautiful. I would skip the free “Beefeater Tour” if it’s raining, since they bring you into the church instead of walking around and showing you the various buildings. Also loved that the guards were in their red uniforms and bearskin hats outside of the Crown Jewels building. (When we arrived they were in the grey uniforms.)","Amazing jewels, armor,  and the sovereign's relics."
"June 14, 2019","My favorite part of our trip. Huge diamonds,  crowns, and suits of armor. Swords that fascinated our boys.  Steep stairs, ancient rooms.  Really great way to learn and experience history. ",Majestic
"June 14, 2019",There a couple of tours in the tour which is a good way to learn the history of the place though they don't take you around as much. Explore by yourself and follow the map given with the entrance ticket. The white tour with Armoury is amazing. The crown jewels are absolutely dazzling and worth the wait (queue waiting time upto 1 hour sometimes). Walk along the ramparts all round the tower and you can enjoy good views of the tower bridge and the city sights. It takes about 4 hours all in so plan a trip with plenty of time. ,Jovial and Fun Yeoman Guide
"June 14, 2019",We had an excellent yeoman guide. I cannot remember his name. He was jovial and gave interesting snippets of history. He has a loud booming voice. No microphone is needed.,A must see
"June 13, 2019","The guide staff are first rate! They have to meet many requirements in order to hold that position of honor to be a guide.Much to see with a lot of history, character and ghosts a plenty. Family jewels are here, but a bit underwhelming as you’re on a slow moving conveyor belt, so impossible to just stare and soak ii in.",Fantastic History!!!
"June 12, 2019",The Tower Of London is amazing if you are a lover of history.  Make sure you take a tour with one of the Beefeaters!  They grant you access to places you otherwise can’t go.  They are also so informative!  Incredibly interesting place!  Plus you get to see the Crown Jewels!  Amazing!,See Crown Jewels early!
"June 12, 2019","We entered just after the Tower opened and took the first guided tour. Our Yeoman warder guide was great! We split just before the end of the tour and walked in to see the Crown Jewels. It was about 1030 when we entered the building and we had no wait. By the time we left the Tower around 1230, the line was well beyond the sign marking a 45 minute wait.",Loved it!
"June 19, 2019",What an amazing place. We took the tour given by the Warders. What a great tour. Then we followed the map and seen everything. What a phenomenal palace! The Crown Jewels are a absolute must see. The line looks long but it goes very fast! Then we went to take a peek at the Ravens. I loved them! So much to do and see inside there!,Our capital city’s greatest attraction
"June 18, 2019","Took the whole family to the Tower as part of my son’s 40th birthday celebration.   We had a great time as we had not visited for 28 years, a previous birthday.   The yeoman that did our tour of the tower , Jim,  was absolutely fantastic and made it funny and interesting.    The only downside for me was that as I was paying for eight it was pricey and they offer their prices with a donation which you do not have to do and I think it should be the other way round.   I personally did the 2 for 1 offer that you get when travelling by rail but you must print the vouchers and have your rail ticket, but it is by far the cheapest way.  Do your maths.   It’s a must do for a visitor to London.  Would have given it 5 stars but I found the pricing with the donation foremost very annoying.",Awesome 
"June 18, 2019",Super interesting place with tons of history. Seeing the beefeaters walking around as well as the palace guards was very cool. The highlight of the day were the crown jewels. They are some of the most amazing pieces of jewelry and diamonds I have ever seen. If you go to London you must go and see the crown jewels. It is interesting to see several billion dollars worth of jewelry in one place. The one negative is that you cannot take pictures once you are inside. I understand why but it would’ve been really cool to have pictures of such beautiful and historic jewelry.  The grounds are wonderfully kept as well. A definite must see.,History
"June 17, 2019",Beautiful felt like I was travelling  back in time. Historical and informative.The queen Victoria and king George exhibition tour was very interesting  learned a lot.,Lots to see but in very palatable chunks. Make sure to go on a sunny day or your tour may be cancelled.
"June 16, 2019","From the Tower's Ravens to the many floors of historical collections, the Tower has much to see. The Museum exhibits are laid out in a way that you can take in as much or as little as you'd like - most of the various attractions within the tower save for the collections in the White Tower (or perhaps the lines for the crown jewels) won't take you too long to get through (unlike, for example, Windsor Castle - which you won't get much out at all of in less than 3 hours). Unfortunately the day we went it started raining five minutes into the tour and the guide cancelled the tour, much to the disappointment of the fifty or so guests in the tour Our guide said something about their costumes not getting wet or too many umbrellas to see the guide. As a result, we ended up exploring the Tower ourselves but still weren't overall disappointed in the attraction.",All that it's built up to be...if you take the beefeater tour
"June 16, 2019","Everyone goes to see this, so you know it's a must-see. Allow at least 3-4 hours. We never got to see the crown jewels - perpetually a 1+hour wait in line... even at 4:45pm when they are nearing closure. Make sure to get there in time for a beefeater tour -- last one in the summer is 3:30pm, 2:30pm winter... and it MAKES the visit. They are so entertaining and knowledgeable!",Amazing
"June 16, 2019","I loved the beefeater's tour. If you are not that much into history, this tour will bring everything into place. The jewels are really once in a lifetime.",So much to explore.
"June 16, 2019",Definitely worth the admission fee. So much to see and explore. Don't miss out the crown jewels hall. So amazing!,Must see
"June 16, 2019","Unfortunately we didn’t have enough time to do it properly. Bought tickets on Viator, go straight to group tickets counter. Definitely on the must see. I would go first thing in the morning and go straight to see the Crown Jewels and then do a Beefeeter tour (unfortunately we didn’t have time). Isn’t well suited for those with limited mobility ",Great Day Out!
"June 16, 2019","We arrived fifteen minutes after it opened and went straight to see the Crown Jewels with no queues. Later in the day, the queue was massive! We enjoyed a tour with a Yeoman Warder and then set off to explore the rest of the castle. The chapel of St Peter ad Vincula was fascinating, then the wonderful displays of armour in the White Tower including the stunning chapel of St John the Evangelist. We loved the fun activities on the top floor where you could dress Henry VIII in his armour, shoot a bow & arrow, practise sword skills on horseback etc. Great fun!There is a display about imprisonment in the Beauchamp Tower, the tale of the two boy princes in the Bloody Tower, an exhibition on torture, the Fusilier Museum, the medieval palace and the battlements. While walking the wall, we passed through other towers with exhibitions of jewel-less crowns, the animals who lived at the tower, defence etc. Visiting the ravens was also very interesting. The New Armouries café was very nice for a simple lunch and had a generous military discount if you serve in the forces. There’s also a discount on entry for military, but not for anyone else so I ordered my ticket online in advance to save money while my husband bought his in person on the day to get his discount. We spent over five hours exploring and absolutely loved it. The toilets behind the Crown Jewels were the best loos, by the way! ",Amazing
"June 10, 2019","Very educational, especially for people who don’t know much about British history, you don’t even need a tour or audio guide. Unfortunately it’s very busy, mostly with American tourists who don’t want to nor care about reading about the tower or considerate of others who are, also many loud school children. Get in early for the crown jewels, line today was almost to traitors gate, and was raining quite heavily. A lot of the museum is outdoors, umbrellas and jackets necessary.",The Yeoman Warder's are a Hoot!
"June 9, 2019","Great tour of a millennia old castle complex with a very rich history (and needless to say, it's a bloody - and not in a UK expletive sort of way).  The Yeoman Warder guides (who are actual service members) are most excellent - funny and with a wealth of knowledge, but don't cross them or they will make sure you behave properly - as a bunch of not so hapless tourists messing around with the Queen's Guard in front of the Jewel House soon found out!  Well deserved.",Must see!
"June 9, 2019","We loved the Tower of London! We didn't buy the audio guide, but the way the complex is laid out, it is very easy to do a self-guided tour. We spent at least 2 hours looking at all of the exhibits and going in the buildings. Since I had bought the tickets online prior to going to England, we avoided waiting in line at the ticket booth. The Tube station is conveniently located across the street.",Tower tour
"June 9, 2019",Definitely try to get in on the tour with the Yeoman Warder (Beefeater)! Wealth of knowledge and humorous insights. Plenty to keep everyone interested and there are fairly good restaurants just off the river afterwards. ,The only.1 
"June 9, 2019",Awesome one of the best day trips you can do anywhere in the world.Come see my city and enjoy the English culture .,Almost a Thousand Years of History
"June 8, 2019","The ""Tower"" is almost indescribable. Today, it is surrounded by much larger buildings and the modern city; in the beginning, about 1066, it would have been, by far, the largest and tallest structure in the area. Even today it has a magical quality about it, looking unlike anything else you have ever seen.The history of the place is essentially the history of England. It has served as a royal palace, fortress, prison, and now, a tourist attraction. The buildings exude an ancient quality, with signs about to help you understand its great age. It is both beautiful and forbidding. My husband and I took a self-guided tour, which was perhaps not the best decision; if I had it to do again, I would go on a guided tour. I was primarily interested in the Tower's history, and therefore I enjoyed seeing the battlements, private rooms, armor collection, ravens, etc. We chose not to see the dungeons and instruments of torture; others might find them of interest.Separately, the Crown Jewels are truly amazing. I think it is best to view them in the context of the times from which each piece comes. They really are not to be viewed as objects of monetary value, but rather, as symbols of a ""time past"", with all the inherent historical baggage of the times. I believe that they give a better idea of the royal lines of England than anything else one might see in London. I believe you will be enlightened in every way by viewing them, and they should not be missed.The lines are long; everyone wants to see the ""Tower"". You will likely need three hours or more; just relax and soak it all in. After all, this is why you came to London in the first place, right?",London Tower
"June 8, 2019","A must see in London, the history is phenominal and the crown jewels and other items were breathtaking.",One of my favorite tours in London
"June 7, 2019","The tower was fantastic. Definitely go on the Beefeater tour when you arrive. Very informative, and funny as well. The crown jewels can't be missed. So many interesting things to see. ",History come alive 
"June 7, 2019",Historic royal palaces really do go above and beyond to bring history alive. Their actors and guides are second to known with a rich knowledge of the spaces. ,Good historical place
"June 7, 2019",I only have one complaint. We bought our tickets on the golden bus tour hop on and off. We weren’t told we needed to exchange our receipt for a ticket. Would make it easier for visitors if they would just take that receipt at the door instead of making you exchange it. Enjoyed seeing the Crown Jewels.,Yeoman tour educational and entertaining
"June 3, 2019","Purchased tickets online so entering was easy. Arrived prior to opening and entered in first wave of visitors, headed directly to Crown Jewels and walked right in. Took the tour with Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly, who was a wonderful guide. My teens and pre-teen thoroughly enjoyed the tour.",What can you say about the Crown Jewels
"June 3, 2019","While the Crown Jewels are a highlight, getting a feel for how it was built and used throughout history was very enlightening.  A place that should be seen during a trip to London",Ye olde England
"June 3, 2019","It is difficult not to game of thrones and Vikings everything but what a gory past we have had. The armoury, the ravens and the Crown of Jewels all lead to another time. As the cannons were going off for Trump and his visit, we pondered the cruelty of the human race and if anything has actually changed. Amazing upkeep of this place and orderly way of navigation. Queues were too long for the Crown jewels though. Actors in full regalia. Just fabulous",Do Not Book with Tiqets online Company!!!!
"June 3, 2019","We bought tickets online & just as we were leaving the house our 11 year old started projectile vomiting!!! We rang the online company & they refused to refund or even exchange tickets for another day!!! So daylight robbery, terrible customer service and DO NOT use this company! The lady on the phone was rude & unhelpful!!! ",Wouldn't Go Back
"June 2, 2019","The good: The beefeater walking tour was awesome! We got Beefeater Bill and he was informative, charming with an awesome sense of humor, probably the best tour guide I've had all my life. The bad: There are lots of lines to be on, you're in long lines for hours and you can only move one step at time. There's no getting out of it and the entire thing is quite claustrophobic. The line to see a replica of the crown jewels is at least an hour long, the other attractions are not that much better. It's like being in the Disneyland for history. Not my idea of a good time.At least it offers a pretty good view of Tower Bridge so there's the saving grace.",Fascinating look at the home of British Royalty since 1066
"June 2, 2019","The Tower of London was a must-see visit for this former English Literature teacher. To walk where William the Conqueror walked was quite a thrill. To see the spot where Anne Boleyn lost her head was beyond my wildest dreams. Of course the Crown Jewels were impressive, as were all the suits of armor on display.  Simply walking the walls next to the Thames made for a wonderful experience. ",Awesome 
"June 2, 2019",Lots of tourist but it was awesome. Lots to see. Lot of walking. Lot of history. We loved the being there for several hours. ,"Amazing, great for any age ! London must-do"
"June 2, 2019","Second time here, simply amazing ! I don’t know how people visit here without doing the Yeoman (Beefeater) free tour. It’s informative, entertaining and memorable. This should be a must do when visiting the Tower. Be aware that holiday periods will attract long queues, especially for the Crown Jewels, we waited an hour to get in.  Nearest Tube is Tower Hill. This is a must do in London. Don’t miss it.",Poor execution
"June 2, 2019","Was such a shame we paid 60 pound for two adults and didn’t even get to see the crown jeweles because the line was just too long. I think there is a missed opportunity at this place, there is just so much to see but so poorly executed. ",Patience
"June 1, 2019",Long lines may test your patience but the displays are worth it. The longest wait was for the crown jewels... but then I was able to view them 4 times as crowd thinned out inside. The yeoman warden tour was a hoot! ,Beefeaters Tour

"May 18, 2019","We got tickets here through the concierge and were able to do the group tour with the Yeoman Warders. He was hilarious and you learn about so much history right where you are standing! The tour was an hour, but then you could go off on your own. I liked seeing the jewels, and the Royal Chapel. It is very interesting, but a little of a downer when you hear all that went on there. Would still recommend! There is a lot of food and vendors near by. It is all mostly outside though so dress warm! There are also guards inside, and the bridge is right around the corner. ",A must
"May 16, 2019","If you go do not pass up the opportunity to take the FREE Beefeaters tour.  You won’t regret it.  They bring to life the history of the Tower of London.  After the tour we visited the Crown Jewels.  Guess we were lucky, because I read so many say there is such a long line.  We walked right to the doors and through mid day.",Exceptional Tour at Tower of London and Crown Jewels
"May 16, 2019","This is a must see while in London.  You can make this a destination and actually visit via the bus tours that allow you to hop on/off at sights.  See history, let your jaw drop when you see the Crown Jewels..WOW.",So much to see!
"May 16, 2019",We went expecting to see the Crown Jewels but were able to experience much more.  Head to the the Crown Jewels upon arrival as the line will get long as the morning go by.  We enjoyed all the the Tower of London had to offer.,Tower of London/Tour by Clive 
"May 16, 2019","Loved this historical site! It is packed with fascinating stories and truly made history come to life. We enjoyed a guide tour by Yeoman Warder Clive. He was incredible! Throughly knowledgeably, passionate, and hilarious to boot. This was one of my favorite stops in London. ","A bit pricey, but it easily has enough entertainment for a large portion of the day"
"May 14, 2019","Approximately 30 pound per person seemed to be a high price initially, but the tower of London has a lot to offer in return. The guided tours are funny and informative. Lovers of old weaponry and armour will enjoy the exhibitions. There's a cafe with all kinds of food inside the tower, but it's fairly pricey. Not everything is accessible by wheelchair. For parents, it pays off to use a lightweight pushchair that can be carried up the stairs. We spent a good portion of the day in the tower, and children under 5 are enter for free. So, considering that this is such a historic sight, I'd say that the price was worth it.",Every day is a school day!
"May 23, 2019","We went to the tower of London and joined a tour with the Yeoman guide-Clive, it lasted around an hour and was funny, informative and friendly. I felt I got so much more from it than I would have walking round on our own. The whole place is really quite impressive and even at the entry price which I would say is a little expensive (£60 for 2 adults) i felt we got our moneys worth. We were there maybe 2.5 hours and really enjoyed it.",Must See
"May 23, 2019","From all the things I've seen in London, the Tower was my favorite! If you have a love for medieval castles, you'll have to see this one. It is also not just a castle, but a rather large group of towers and exhibition rooms. Loved it!",A London Must
"May 23, 2019","On our 12 day (self organized) tour of the UK we had to make time for the famous Tower of London.  If turned out to be the best attraction we saw in the London.  It's pricey to get in but well worth it.We did a walking tour in the morning, and made our way via Undergroud to Tower Hill.  We go there around 2pm which mean we had 3.5 hours to see the place.  So it's not just a tower, its a castle.  We probably could have used another hour, but we did manage to see the highlights.  You start out with about a 45 minute tour and overview from one of the Beefeaters.  It's really informative.  Lots of apartments and chambers as well as the crown jewels to see.  Well worth the $ and the time.  Don't miss it.",must see this place
"May 22, 2019","so much history here in one place, you will not only see the history presented inside the tower, but also the beautiful buildings and gardens outside.",easy tickets to the tower.
"August 31, 2021",It was really easy and straight forward to book and tickets were sent promptly.  Would be good if you added a facility to add the tickets to iphone wallet.The tower trip was amazing and the kids really loved it and have asked to go again.,Amazing history
"August 31, 2021",Had an amazing visit to the Tower of london.  So much to see and take in. I visited with my parents who are both 65+. They thoroughly enjoyed the day. Some of the  old buildings have spiral stairs which may not be suitable for someone with mobility issues.,Brilliant Tower visit
"August 31, 2021",Fabulous attraction - obviously - but it was the wit and kindness of the yeoman staff  that made it memorable. They went out of their way to answer questions with knowledge and patience,A fabulous day out
"August 31, 2021",The tower was a fabulous day out for all our family. Our two small girls (6 and 4) loved it! The crown jewels are beyond anything I've ever seen before. Would highly recommend.,Great value for money

"August 31, 2021","Haven't been here for over 50 years but still enthralling and fascinating.  Visited the White Tower, the Bloody Tower, the battlements, the Armoury and even got to see the guards at the Crown Jewels exhibition change.  Plenty of people there, but easy to move around and see things.",Excellent experience
"August 31, 2021",It's an amazing experience so much history even has the crown jewels which are still in use today. The guide had excellent knowledge of the history and a good amount of wit. Would recommend to anyone.,A fun day out
"August 30, 2021",It was a lovely day out! We really enjoyed our experience of the Tower of London and took loads of photos. Staff were incredibly helpful and added to the fun throughout the day. Will definitely be back!,Fabulous day with the Jewels
"August 30, 2021","The crown jewels were amazing, as was the whole visit.  We gave ourselves 2 hours here (we had booked another attraction), this was not long enough.  As you walked around the grounds each area had so much information to take in.  Will definitely be going back for a second visit.",Tower of London and Beefeater 409
"August 30, 2021",Had a great time at the Tower of London especially the Ceremony of the Keys (separate ticket needed). Beefeater 409 was a fantastic guide and was both knowledgable and entertaining . Overall the Tower of London well worth a visit.,VERY interesting and fun facts
"May 22, 2019",Viator was an excellent company to do this with. Very informative and smooth process to see many of the sites in London,Great spot
"May 21, 2019","Lovely spot to get some pictures and stroll along the river. You can get drinks to go and take your time enjoying all of the scenery around, just beautiful!",Gorgeous
"May 20, 2019",Lots to walk through but its definitely worth the walk. There is so much history and so much to learn you could not get enough. Must not leave London without visiting!,Beefeaters Tour
"May 19, 2019",Highly recommend the free tour given by the Beefeaters informative and very informative. The Crown Jewels were interesting,Day at the Tower
"May 19, 2019","Wonderful interesting place. Crown jewels, beefeaters & ravens. Give yourself a good 2-3 hours here-fascinating!",Tower of London
"May 19, 2019","Both kids (13 & 6) enjoyed this stop as part of a day tour. Crown Jewels, overly friendly ravens and a great view of the Tower Bridge were some highlights.",Must see historic site
"May 28, 2019","The Tower of London is probably the single most must see historical site in London. Centuries of history in one place. The crown jewels are kept here and the entertaining beef eater tour is very entertaining. So much to see here, so allow at least half a day.",Awesome Tower of London
"May 27, 2019","So fun with all the guards, artifacts, cannons and crows. Had a good lunch at the restaurant. The many suits of armour were cool.","History at its finest, worts and all! "
"May 27, 2019","Great place to visit, so much history. Worth doing the tour £54 for a guided tour that takes around 1 hour & 1/2.  Definitely a must see whilst in London. ",Fabulous
"May 27, 2019","We went in winter and it was the best, so few crowds and lots of hsiotory. Smalller than I remember but easy to navigate and see it all",Study Abroad
"May 26, 2019",The Tower of London was absolutely beautiful! I would recommend going to see this historical monument to everyone. We witnessed the changing of the guards as well as seeing the Crown Jewels. The measures taken to ensure all were able to see everything was phenomenal.,Excellent attraction
"May 26, 2019","I will highly recommend this attraction to all travellers. Excursion with befeaters were great. I have never been on such entertaining, funny and informative tour. It takes 45min. King krowns are spectacular, and because of moving path there are not queues.Scone and coffee in coffee where great. Everything were great, clean, entertaining and there were no queues!",Amazing Amazing
"May 26, 2019","We joined the guided tour by Beefeater Scott Kelly who was totally brilliant. His wealth of knowledge was fantastic as well as a great sense of humour & displayed his love for queen & country. Well done Scott, you made our visit perfect.The Tower was breathtaking, so beautiful & we learnt so much more than we could have imagined.It was a fantastic way to spend an afternoon & the grounds are so wonderfully maintained.",Great
"May 26, 2019","It is so cool to visit and learn so much history.  It was not boring at all, the lines moved relatively quickly, and I got to see the Crown Jewels!  ",Well done
"May 24, 2019","There is a lot of history here and the beefeaters do a great job of sharing history, telling stories and making the audience laugh. Definitely recommend the tour and then just wander around. Plan for several hours to half a day. Worth the trip.",Very interesting 
"May 24, 2019",Thoroughly enjoyed this visit and learning about the history. Ensure you join in on a beefeaters tour which run every half an hour and are free to join once you walk through the entrance.,Not impressed with charity donation
"May 7, 2019","Amazing piece of British heritage, however I found it disgraceful that on ticket purchase you are NOT asked if you'd like to add a charity donation but you are asked for a total including it!I queried it and was told that I did not ha e to pay the charity sum but I think its appauling how visitors, are not asked!I'm also enraged that such an important piece of British history has become reliant on a charity! They house the Queen Jewells- surely she should pay for them to be protected!Absolute embarrassment to our country! ",Again - a must visit in London
"May 7, 2019","Get here early, queues can be long. Join a free tour - it is fun, very informative. The queues to visit the Crown Jewels can also get very long so visit here first if the queues are short. The visit can take up to half a day.",GO EARLY!
"May 6, 2019","The Beefeater Tour was very good, however, there was a large group assembled... between 40 and 50 people, so you had to stay close to hear everything.  You meet the Yeoman right after you walk through the gate.  There does not seem to be a limit to the crowd size.  He walks you around the grounds and gives you the history of the Tower and it's denizens with knowledge and wit.  The tour lasts about an hour.  We then got into a very long queue to see the crown jewels.   We should have done that first, because the line got longer and longer throughout the day.  It was an hour and a half wait, so bring water, snacks, etc.   You can easily spend 5 hours here.",Strong imprint
"May 6, 2019","Visiting the Tower with all its history is quite a strong event. Expecially as you have a view towards the shard from one corner. The amount of time, and all that has evolved,between those thwo were built is mindblowing ",Absolutely worth a visit!
"May 6, 2019","My husband, kids (13, 9) and I enjoyed this tour immensely.  You learn so much about the history of London when you do a tour with the distinguished (and incredibly funny) Beefeaters.  Plus, you get to see the Crown Jewels!  ",Incredible experience
"May 5, 2019",It is a spectacular and very large castle.  Go early because there is so much to see and long lines.  Just to enter to see the jewels of The Crown you do more than 30 minutes  but you won’t believe  what you will see: true jewels (except 1),Loved the History
"May 4, 2019","We absolutely loved the Tower of London, and ended up going back on a different trip.  This is SO much history.  We did the guided tour and that was amazing, we learned so very much about the history of England.  I actually think we will go back again a third time the next time we go to London as the kids will be older and it is just a good learning opportunity.  ",Interesting walk tour
"May 4, 2019","The tower has shown a bit of European history, and what kind of things usually happened inside the building! You can read the explanations in Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Deutch, English and Korean. Some days you can pay to go into. It’s has a nice old architecture, which was made in 1070.  ",The crown jewels are there!
"May 4, 2019","If you'd like to see the actual crown jewels worn by the past king and queens, this is the place to be. But be warned though, the line just to go inside the room for the jewels is about 20mins long. There are other rooms in the area but it was the most interesting. ",Need a lot of time here
"May 4, 2019","We bought tickets online. You have to pick up your own line tickets. We waited 30 minutes to pick up the tickets only to be told to go to another counter - where we didn't have to wait at all! Our goal was to get in right a 9am when the got in - instead we got in almost 40 minutes later! It is BUSY at this place so we wanted to see things before the crowds all arrived. In this day with the technology that we have, I don't understand why the ticket can't just be downloaded to your mobile device. That needs to be improved on!!!Other than the ticket delay, we enjoyed our visit tho we didn't see everything here we wanted to. Once the crowds come in there are line ups to see every part. We went straight to the Crown Jewels, and did get in with probably only a 10 minute wait. (had we come in right at 9 we wouldn't have waited at all). After seeing the crown jewels we rushed over to get in on the 10am Beefeater tour. There was probably 100 people on the tour. They need to offer more tours in a day. Small kids end up being at the back because the walk slowest - so then they miss it magic of it. the Beefeater tour was good but not as memorable as when we were here many years ago.",Must see piece of history!
"May 3, 2019",Don’t leave London without visiting The Tower. So much history here.  Plan to spend at least half a day to look around and learn.  The Yeomans tour is included but gets very busy. I suggest paying extra for the audio tour to guide you around.,Bigger Than Ben Hur!
"May 2, 2019","I never thought the Tower of London was so big! It's massive! We didn't get anywhere near seeing it all, but what we did see, was engaging, fascinating & made us so pleased we never lived in these times. The Yoe Men talks are brilliant & absolutely a must do - they are full of information & presented in a really engaging way. All the exhibits are well presented & easy to follow.The Crown Jewels were amazing.The gory history was eye opening.We are so glad we came here, and you will be too!",Historic palace
"May 1, 2019","I love British history, so when I knew my family was traveling to London, this was one of the places I needed to visit.  Learning more about the rich history of Henry VIII and his wives, Queen Mary (Bloody Mary) and getting to see the crown jewels was a sight to see.",The Majesty of it all...........
"May 1, 2019","I initially did not know what to expect about visiting the Tower of London. I really was not prepared for the way I felt when my closest friend and I finished touring ""The Tower"". The beginning history of a nation is held inside these walls. We decided to walk the grounds & buildings without a guide as this would allow us to go at our own pace..Good Decision. The first thing that struck me was the architecture and how the craftsmen of that time did such precision design & stonework without the modern tools & design sensability of today...I would hear people say ""How did they do that without a crane"" It does truly boggle the mind when you stop to think about it.It is essentially a fortress on the river, but there was a community of life inside those walls. Kings, Queens, servants & soldiers shared a kind of spartan existense inside those walls. Life began there and life was taken there. Most of the rooms & halls now inside the internal buildings are filled with royal antiquity. There is so much to take in & digest. This is where touring on your own lets you stand, gaze and ponder The Majesty of it all.This is truly an English, if not, a World treasure that is more than worthy of investing your time to explore. A journey back in time that needs to be appreciated.",Must have in London
"April 28, 2019","Early in the morning already a very-very long quee, however we were extremly fast in Tower. Very nice staff, always helpful, always there to help. Tower itself very clean, good map, very interesting exhibitions. ",Brilliant
"April 26, 2019","A must in London! Busy but worth the wait. Travel by tube, easiest route. Crown Jewels are amazing. A great day.",Well worth the price of admission!
"April 25, 2019",A lot of British history is contained this this medieval castle. You can see a smaller changing of the guard ceremony as well as see the Crown Jewels. ,Old castle with rich history
"April 24, 2019","Spent a morning here and was told to look at the Crown Jewels first as the exhibit gets more crowded later. Interesting display of crowns, weapons of Royalty with a lot of precious stones on them. From the Tower you can also walk to the Tower Bridge which is a famous landmark across the Thames! ",Great place to spend time & learn about history!
"April 24, 2019",We got there around 10am and went straight to the Royal Crown Jewels to avoid the long lines (expect long lines after 11am....) We spent about 3 hrs at the Tower. Great place for kids too.  They had skids with characters on grounds for the kids.  Learned lot about history of the Tower and events.,Expensive but worth it!
"April 22, 2019",We visited with our two children who both loved seeing a place they have read about in history lessons at school. The Crown Jewels were very impressive (get there early to avoid the queues) and there was lots more to see. You can easily spend several hours there and it’s worth getting there early as it gets very busy.,Tower of London still amazing 
"January 23, 2019",A visit to the Tower of London is a must if visiting London. The complex is large and offers many excellent views of the City and the River Thames. The Crown Jewels display is breathtaking. The White Tower has an extensive showing of armour and weapons. The on-site Cafe is excellent. Good tasty food and not to expensive. The famous Crows and Beefeaters add to the visit.,Very rude staff 
"January 21, 2019","Shame shame shame that the employees don’t realise the impact of their behaviour and attitude on tourism in London. People at the gate were as cold as ice answering questions. One of the guards assigned for one area of the Tower of London wanted to call police on us because we wanted to enter the exhibit room 15 min before the closing time.... and the way he talked to us! Wow as we were pieces of dirt, meanwhile we paid £50 for our tickets what pay his salary. If he doesn’t want to do his job he should stay home and collect unemployment. I live in London but will never take any visitors there again as I don’t want to risk having a spoiled day. ",Interesting
"January 18, 2019","If you pre-purchase tickets online, you collect them at the group ticket line up, however signage is poor and we wasted a good 40 minutes lining in the wrong queue. The escalator around the crown jewels kept people moving and was a great idea! The queue for seeing these was long but it did keep moving. Photographing the ravens kept us busy while lining up. There was much to see at the Tower, but it was very busy and we were over lining up and tired. Suggest you go early in the morning - it is a full day's outing. ",Great tourist spot with history but arrive early in the day!
"January 17, 2019",The Tower of London is a MUST for every American tourist when visiting London!  You can learn about a LOT of British history and see the crown jewels.  Take the tour first and let a Beefeater/Yoeman give you all facts.  Don't miss the dungeon.  It has a nice cafe for lunch.  But it takes several hours and it is a bit expensive so be sure to go early in the day and plan accordingly.  Don't forget your camera!,Great tour
"January 14, 2019",Great day out for the whole family. I could go here many times. The three hour tour by the guide a must to do. He catered for all ages of the group going around.If go by train. please but all day ticket and it then a 2 for 1 attraction,Go EARLY and go STRAIGHT TO THE JEWELS to avoid INSANE queues!!!
"January 11, 2019","If you haven’t been to London since Instagram conquered the world, you need to know that tourism in London has become bonkers, with Disney-style queues at every tourist site. Tower of London is one of those places. During any holiday period (we were there between Christmas and New Years, but apparently this is also true all summer and most of the spring too!), the line to get into the Tower is unreal... and once you're inside, the line for the Crown Jewels needs to be seen to be believed. You can absolutely avoid both of these queues by planning ahead. Buy tickets in advance, and print them at home. These tickets are NOT timed-entry, and the Tower opens at 10am. That means you need to get there at 9:30am (the queue will have already formed by then!). When you get into the castle, resist the temptation to explore, linger, pose for photos etc.—plenty of time for that later! – and GO STRAIGHT TO THE CROWN JEWELS. Trust me on this. We went there right at 10am and we waited about 25 minutes on the Crown Jewels queue, which felt rather long considering we couldn’t have gotten there any earlier. By the time we came out, the queue had expanded to a two-hour wait, without exaggeration. They had costumed entertainers playing music for the people in the queue to prevent rioting. It was bonkers. We had four kids with us, so we were especially grateful that we had prioritized. (Several reviews claim that with children, you should go to the White Tower first. Yes, the White Tower has loads of awesome stuff for kids. But if you don’t go to the Jewels first, you will not see the jewels. Which are pretty impressive and unmissable for kids too. If you go to the Jewels first, you’ll see it all.) There’s a lot to see in the Tower and you can easily spend four hours here, especially with curious children—lots of hands-on exhibits, costumed actors interacting with visitors, etc. Don’t waste your time on line. Plan ahead!",Traveler
"January 9, 2019",Excelent place. Ravens are inteteresting.The best is Crown Juwels exibition. They are really amazing. Also view on Tower Bridge is excelent,Great introduction to London
"January 6, 2019","If you go on a busy morning, head straight to the crown jewels, and then hit the white tower, and finish with the beefeater tour to avoid the lines.",We lost our day in the queues 
"January 3, 2019","We were really looking forward to our visit around the Tower. After visiting St Paul’s, Hampton Court and the Houses of Parliament, our expectations were high but we were soon to be disappointed. The queue to see the Crown Jewels stretched around every corner. There were so many people on site, we couldn’t see the detail of the rooms we entered  or the information boards. There should be a daily tour time so everybody can get the best of the experience or don’t sell as many tickets. It’s an important piece of British history and for the price of the ticket you don’t get value for money. ",Beefeaters are the Best
"December 31, 2018","The Beefeater tour was the highlight of the trip. Such incredible history. I wish they would let you take pictures of the Crown Jewels but judging by all the people that had been beheaded there previously, I decided to not risk getting caught. ",BEWARE OF VIATOR
"March 13, 2019",I am travelling to London with family and we decided to visit the Tower of London. I booked and paid for 4 tickets online via the trip advisor site. I suddenly realised I had booked the wrong date and so tried to transfer the date to the correct date. After an inordinate length of time and being passed to various people/departments I was told the date I actually wanted was fully booked and I would lose 100% of my ticket. Out of interest I tried the process again with the correct date and miraculously it would’ve accepted my booking. So in other words if you make a simple error they keep your moneyBEWARE,"Being American, we tend to think of our governments 200 plus years activity as rather long, but not so in England."
"March 11, 2019","To appreciate The Tower of London one must know a bit of history, as the Tower has played a great roll in English history. The imprisonment of the two young princes, and their kiiing. The execution of Ann Bolyn, 2nd or 3rd wife of Henry VIII, by sword.  There is a brass plaque on the ground where this took place. The death of Mary, Queen of Scotts took place there, along with much political activity, and executions to change England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one, ""The Church of England"" with the various intrigues and wars which were based in religion. The Tower is most definatley a place to visit, also to see the Beefeater guards, in their spectacular uniforms...take time to visit and absorb the history of the place, in fact, study up on English History, and that will make your visit all the more meaningful.",Visit and Do the Yeoman's Tour
"March 10, 2019","We recently visited the Tower of London with our nine-year-old son and made a point to take Yeoman Warder Andy's tour.  We are so glad we did!  We have been to the Tower before on several occasions and saw different rooms but we did not have such an in-depth understanding of the history and events at the Tour until we took the Yeoman Warder tour.  Because of that guided tour, we investigated buildings in the Tower we had never visited before and we learned a lot of interesting and informative history.  The Yeoman Warder tours last about an hour and should not be missed.",Don't lose your head.
"March 10, 2019",Great piece of history. Lovely architecture. Well thought out for tourists of any nationality. Superb collections to view including the Crown Jewels and the Ravens.Eating there can be expensive and long queues to suffer. ,Fun Day
"March 7, 2019",Lots to see!! I recommend to pay the 5 pounds for the tour recorder. Has a really great cafe and gift shops. You could really spend the day just looking at the Crown Jewels and the armory. Highly recommended  ,Oh If the Walls Could Talk
"March 7, 2019",Emposing structure which has plenty of secrets.  Just remember a queen lost her head in this structure.   ,"A castle, crown jewels, and torture chambers- oh my!"
"March 1, 2019","One of the most historic sites in London - beautifully restored and maintained and home to the opulent (some might say gaudy) crown jewels. Diamonds apparently are forever. It's a wonderful place to spend half a day with dramatic scenes across the Thames and over to Tower Bridge.   Loaded with history, it's also a child friendly - with an interactive space on the top floor of the castle.  ",Know before you go
"February 25, 2019","Read some great books on the Tower's history prior to my trip, which really brought to life what I was seeing. Highly recommend the Beefeater tour which is free with admission, Mr. Kelly was very informative and entertaining. Early morning seems to be the best time, as it gets more crowded later on.",Fun day out!
"February 23, 2019","We had a lovely time there! At first your kids would probably think that this is just an educational place but no it isn't!We were there for about 3-4 hours and got through everything. We saw the Crown Jewels and had to queue for 30 mins so I would say to do it just before you go. There were lots of interactive activities for the children to do such as this electric arrow game, sword games and many more! They also had some tours for children which included dressing up in medieval clothing and having fun sword fights! There was a lot of useful information and models of objects.This is a good and fun place to take your children. ",Excellent tour
"February 23, 2019","We were not sure what to expect going into the Tower of London- didn’t have much understanding of the history of London. The tour was included in the ticket price and it was excellent. Skip did a tremendous job- honestly one of the best tour guides I’ve ever had- enjoyed every minute. We spend over 4 hours touring around. This was so worth it. Highly recommend coming here vs St. Paul’s cathedral where we went in, looked around and decided it wasn’t worth the money (esp if you come back for a service then the church is free vs the 20 pound entrance fee- which is ridiculous for a church). Tower of London was totally worth it on the other hand. Loved this experience and our tour guide Skip- well done!",Fabulous Jewels
"December 3, 2018","The Crown Jewel exhibit was wonderful; the amount of wealth displayed in those cases was staggering.  The torture exhibit was also quite informative.  Even though the lines were long, they moved quickly and orderly.",Go early and enjoy the grounds alone!
"November 27, 2018","My wife and I arrived to the Tower shortly after it opened for the day, and it was amazing how few people were there. A castle with as much history as this I would have assumed would be busy at all hours of the day. We had a solid 30-45 minutes of roaming the grounds nearly alone and contemplating what life must have been like during the days the Tower was in use. The Yeoman Warder tour is a MUST. You'll get about an hour long tour with lovely historical tidbits about the tower and the grounds from one of the beefeaters who lives there. Crowned jewel tip: go to the tower early and then bee-line it to the crowned jewels. I've heard that the line merely to enter the building where the jewels are kept can sometimes be an hour or more, but first thing in the morning, we strolled right in and were able to view the jewels in languid peace and quiet with only 20-30 others nearby.",Big Thumbs Up from NYC!!!
"November 27, 2018","Of course, the big tourist draw at The Tower of London are the Crown Jewels, which are amazing, but there is so much more to experience.  For all the castles, fortresses, draw bridges, prisoner experiences, etc., we have each experienced through movies (and maybe Disney parks), it’s all here, some dating  back to the 11th Century.  The Tower of London is a remarkable journey back in time! ",Excellent as usual
"November 26, 2018",The Beefeater guides make this attraction perfect.  I love this place. Perfect for kids. Buy the Mission London book and have kids check off the details at the sites.,Very good historical visit
"November 26, 2018",We visited the Tower of London recently and found it to be an excellent visitors attraction full of history and very informative.,Interesting place
"November 22, 2018","We visited with our 8 and 4 year old while sightseeing in London. They’d both been studying shut Fawkes at school so we thought they’d like to see the place where he was held. They loved it! There was a lot more to do then we expected. The kids particularly enjoyed the interactive elements in the white tower. The jewels were obviously a highlight - we went there first to avoid the queues.All of the staff were friendly, professional and knowledgable. You could tell that they had a military background.The cafe was lovely. I highly recommend trying some of the cakes. They seemed a little overpriced but were definitely worth it. Overall, it was an interesting and enjoyable day.",Great place
"November 22, 2018",I thought it was pricey (26£) but it’s really expansive. The general tour route is the perimeter so you keep getting new views of the city and interior. The Crown Jewels are pretty cool to see. At 18£ it would be 5 stars 😉,Awesome is too small a word to define the experience 
"November 18, 2018",Reached the Tower of London at 2.15 pm...had bought the ticket online which turned out to be cheaper compared to the price if you stood at the ticket counterGot to know the ticket included a free tour...Was happy to be a part of the Yeoman Warder Tour which began at 2.30 pm...our Beefeater guide Dan was hilarious all the wayHe kept us entertained throughout the one hour plus informed us about all the detailsWitnessed the password change march ceremony handled by the guards of the towerApart from all the Crown Jewels stored here I also got a chance to see the Kohinoor diamond from India studded in the Royal crown weighing approx 105.6 Carats...was awaiting a chance to get to see it for a really long time and it just did not disappoint...it truly is a beauty Definitely worth a visit once your in LondonHighly recommended !!!!I would myself come again if i ever get a chance,Brilliant Beefeater-Led tour of The Tower!
"November 18, 2018","Didn't know what to expect but would recommend this one during a London visit. Take a Beefeater tour(they're free and run every 30mins)to start your visit, quite simply brilliant! Plenty to see in addition to the beefeater tour, and the Cafe/Restaurant on site offers good food and drink choices.",Great
"November 16, 2018","The Tower And The crown jewels are so beautiful. We love London. When a man is tired of London, he is tired of live. ",Half Term Family Day Out
"October 25, 2018","My husband, our 9 year old daughter and I visited the Tower of London today for a special half term day out. It has been the most awesome day.We took advantage of a Beefeater led guided tour. Our guide (Yeoman Warden Amanda Clarke) was superb. Delivering a warm, knowledgeable and fascinating insight into the Towers history. I feel honoured to have had her as our guide given that she is only one of two female Yeoman Wardens, in the history of the Tower.We spent over 5 hours wandering around the Tower, taking in the many displays and exhibitions. The highlight however has to be the Crown Jewels. Given their popularity there were queues to see them, but the attraction is so well managed, we never felt like we were waiting in line for any great length of time. Once inside, face to face with the crowns and regalia was completely worth any sense of waiting.  I would highly recommend this London attraction as a family day out.",History of English Kings
"October 24, 2018",Very well conservated place with many atractions how was reallity life throughtout many centuries. Some interactions about they defend the premisses from attacks.,Must See while in London!
"October 24, 2018","First matter of importance..this place shuts down at 5:30pm. My husband and I saved this event for later in the day and then had to sprint through to see what we wanted. They do let you use your ticket for any day so there is some flexibility there. That being said, the things we did see were amazing. Must see the crown jewels! The architecture of the Tower alone is amazing. Full of history and plenty to see! There are also shops and food nearby. Also and epic picture sport for the Tower Bridge.",Great time spent
"October 23, 2018","Steve was a wonderful tour guide, very knowledgeable. I was happy to spend a little bit of time in this beautiful, historic landmark. ",Worth a visit
"October 23, 2018","Not my first visit but wanted to take my son. As always well kept, clean and plenty of Beefeaters to help us!. Role plays going in for entertainment. A good time to go is the morning before the crowds as you have enough time to see everything. ",Must visit in London
"October 22, 2018",One of the place you cannot miss when visiting London. Lot of history and things to be seen. Great experience for both my daughters that enjoyed every single moment ,So enjoyed our trip to the Tower!
"October 21, 2018","As a big fan of Tudor England, going to the Tower of London to see where Anne Boleyn was hung was of huge interest.  Took one of the complimentary tours, which was really informative.  Highly recommend if visiting London.",Return Visit After Many Years....The Tower Has Really Stepped Up Its Game!!
"October 21, 2018","At the end of a 2 week cruise around the British Isles, we spent a couple of days in London visiting some old favorites.  We have been impressed overall how much the interpretation at the Royal Palaces has improved, and the Tower is no exception.  We were there on a breezy day, a little chilly at the end of Sept.  It was great to be back and stroll the grounds leisurely.  In particular we recommend the Medieval Palace Exhibit as it has some wonderful restored rooms presented as they were with all the trimmings....we walked a portion of the wall after on of these and it presented a gorgeous view of the Thames and of the houses where the Yeoman Warders live.  Our daughter was the only one who got the audioguide and she pronounced it as unnecessary.  In particular we loved the costumed interpreters strolling around....stop and engage them if you are not too shy, it makes the visit come alive.  I had a fine conversation with Sir Walter on his and my views of women's rights in Tudor England!",Most entertaining and informative
"October 17, 2018","Ward Yeoman Jason Woodcock is the most interactive, informative and energetic tour guide I have had in years. Audience participation, cheeky comedy, and truth about the Tower of London and it's impact on history are included in in the this hour-ish long trip around the points of interest as it relates to people who were tried, convicted, imprisoned, and executed either on Tower Hill or Tower Green.Recommendation for this site is get there early to see the Crown Just... absolutely stunning...and then take the tour....the start every thirty minutes....just keep your head, and everything will be fine!",Never disappointing...
"October 15, 2018","We had the occasion to revisit the Tower of London after a gap of many years when the girls were younger and somewhat less interested in this magnificent historic 900 yr. old castle and fortress on the banks of the River Thames. Now as mature adults it is easy to see how engaged you can be  to be caught up in the stories and fables that went on inside those dark walls and dungeons of famous and infamous prisoners and royals alike. Once a palace, prison, armory and museum it has seen many venues over time.The beefeater entertained us accordingly with an hour tour of the castle with compelling, some gruesome,  stories of went on inside the walls and who had lived there. Among the most famous being Henry V111 and his many wives, some of who hanged there.A beautiful chapel is on site as well of course the Crown Jewels which provide an array of priceless crowns and artifacts worn by various royalty over the centuries. The ravens ever presence at the tower  keep the superstition going that if the ravens leave the monarchy and the tower will fall. So the ravens are well fed.Always a marvelous ""take in"" and a worth while visit as you are cast back in time and try to imagine what it was like to live in those somewhat barbaric and unforsaken times,behind those thick, strong dark walls ..prisoner or royalty alike.Go and see for yourself... you will be fascinated at this wonderful piece of history an iconic piece of London that has stood so well preserved despite the ravages of war.",Do not miss the opportunity to visit this amazing piece of history
"October 15, 2018","I had not been to the Tower of London in over twenty years. The history of the Tower and the Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula within the walls is unbelievable. To walk the Tower and the inner courtyard where kings and queens lived for hundreds of years is unbelievable. If you only have time to visit one landmark within the city, make this the one you choose.",Great visit.  Great guides
"October 14, 2018",Worth seeing.  Excellent history to see.  Crown jewels crowded but the crowd moved good.  Worth the visit for sure,It's a guy thing - except for the jewels
"October 14, 2018",It was a pretty interesting place to see.  I think guys like it better because of the armour and weapons.  I like the jewels - incredible to see.  A definite if you have time.,Rainy day at Tower of London
"October 12, 2018","England has a long Royal history. Tower of London is like a small village with its own community. Amazing architecture, medival palace, crown jewels, prisoner execution place, chapel. Learn the line of Kings who stay in the Palace. Extravagant  life style. We visited on a rainy day and not many shelter area. Remind all london visiting friends to put a small umbrella on your bag at all time. If you have a London pass will be able to enter without queuing. You can purchase online. A good deal for you to enjoy your london sightseeing in a discounted price. Enjoy your trip! Dont miss it. ",Family visit to the Tower of London 
"October 10, 2018",We visited the Tower of London as a family and had an amazing time. It was such a great learning experience for our 8 and 11 year old girls and for us! We had been here before without children and would recommend it as a top sight in London for any visitor. ,Absolutely excellent!!
"October 9, 2018","We used our LNER train tickets to get 2for 1 admission, this makes a trip fantastic value for money.We joined a tour by one of the Beefeaters called Mark, well from the very start he was hilarious, he made the history of the Tower very interesting and is a fantastic asset to this establishment. The whole tour and visit was excellent and well worth a visit.",UK history
"October 9, 2018","I loved this place. It is full of history. Visiting in October is quite pleasant. Weather was great and not too crowded. We arrived early and there was no wait for the Crown Jewels. We also saw exhibitions on torture, the ravens and the guided tour. However, as a non-native speaker, I found the guided tour a little difficult to understand. I would recommend the audio tour if you have trouble understanding accented English.",Holy crap this place is cool
"October 6, 2018",With deep history seated in the foundations of England monarchy this place blew us away. It’s hard to believe the age of this venue and the extent to which it helped form today’s world. The free tour was worth the wait when we first arrived - highly recommend taking the time to be on one of these tours. All the stories from monarchs to ravens to the zoo provided a great sense of the importance of the Tower. The Crown Jewels exhibit was stunning - but would have been nice to take pictures. Overall a very memorable attraction.,Rich History
"October 6, 2018",I was plesently surprised by this attraction.  I honestly had no idea about what this was before gaining admission through our London Pass.  There are guided tours which I highly recommend that tell you the history of the Tower leading into the tower.  Then end of the guided tour will leave you in the cathedral where the public is halted from admission until the tour is over (around 45 mins).  From there you can use the audio guide to explore on your own.  The main attraction is the crown jewels which can queue very quickly.  The lines move steadily but make sure you don't miss out on that!  I highly recommend this attraction seeing as it plays a huge part in history.,Well organized interesting historical site
"October 4, 2018",Nice free guided tours - full of humor and history. Impressive presentation of Crown Jewels. After the visit you can walk over the Tower Bridge to the south bank of Thames river,"As Always, Worth Visiting"
"August 14, 2018","I’ve been to London a few times and even lived here in college, yet the Tower never ceases to entertain and enlighten me. Brought our teens here first off on arriving and got the AUDIO TOUR which was totally worth it. (Beefeaters are great but huge crowds make them hard to engage with/hear.) Absolutely do the audio and send your teens on their ways. Somewhat long line on a Monday into White Tower, but mostly sane otherwise. (We we’re in the nabe again today’s and we’re surprised that at 11 AM line was looong but moving.) The kids liked the Bloody Tower best. Of course. ",The Yeoman of the Tower are the BEST guides
"August 14, 2018","I love listening to the guides here.  They are so funny, so informative!  The white tower is so incredible with displays.  Of course, the crown jewels are worth a look - but NO PHOTOS!  I highly recommend this stop.  ",Warden Tour with Spike
"August 13, 2018","Just enjoyed the Warden tour with Spike. His talk about the history of the Tower was informative and amusing. We were taken around the inner walls and shown The Traitors Gate, The White Tower. The tour  ended in the church of St Peters where many of the traitors headless bodies were buried. Thoroughly recommend these tours. ",Coped with crowds 
"August 12, 2018","It was extremely busy being a Sunday in August. Line was almost around the block but moved fast once open. If you can, get your ticket online and take a printout so you dont have to wait in ticket line. Arrive early also. Once inside, do the crown jewels first to avoid the ever increasing line. Enjoyable.",Multigenerational group loved it. 
"August 9, 2018",Our group ranged from 11 to 80 years old. There was something of interest for everyone. We did this as an added ticket to the Big Bus tour and it was perfect. ,Step back in time...
"August 8, 2018","The Tower of London is one of my favorite places to visit in London. There's so much history there, and the Beefeaters are not just knowledgable, they're also entertaining. Our 10 yr old daughter had a great time working on the puzzle/mystery that they set up for families, and also really enjoyed the hands-on exhibits in the top floor of the castle. And of course, you can't go to the Tower without seeing the fabulous Crown Jewels! The one ""negative"" I'd say is the on-site cafe; the food was a little pricey, and not very good. If you can, probably best to eat elsewhere.",It was a lifelong dream to see this...
"August 7, 2018","I love history, especially English history, and going to the Tower of London thrilled me. This is a beautiful, fascinating place, full of secrets, life, and death. Seeing Traitor's Gate gave me goosebumps, likewise the execution site on Tower Hill. Since I was quite young I have loved to read information about British kings and queens, and knowing I was walking in the footsteps of many of them took my breath away. Seeing the Queen's Jewels, the ancient armor in the White Tower, just feeling the ambience of the old buildings (some 800 years old--amazing!) left me speechless. There were places to eat, benches to sit and rest, but so much to see we could have easily spent several more hours there. Easy to get to from the Tube. I highly recommend seeing this if you're in London! (There are some tours you can sign up for once you're there, but we wanted to do it on our own.)",Great experience
"August 5, 2018",This was amazing.  My ultimate goal was to see the Crown Jewels and boy was it fantastic.  A must see for anyone.,MUST-VISIT
"August 4, 2018","One of my favorite (if not favorite) tour of all-time. The ""tower"" has tremendous history. Take the live tour delivered by a beef eater guard. Visit the dungeon, the crown jewels, the prisoner water entrance, see where heads were removed from people's bodies, visit the chapel, and visit the white tower with all the armor. Henry VIII's ""form-fitting"" armor is a must. Walk around and give yourself about 2-3 hours to check out all the sights. Walk over to the tower bridge after visiting. Walk along the Thames. It's a great place - Must-do!",Beefeaters Rock
"August 4, 2018","Went first thing in the morning with our small Rick Steve’s tour group. We were told to go straight to the Crown Jewels and then go back to join a Beefeater tour. That’s what we did. Line for the jewels was minimal, but by the time we exited it was backed up to the sign saying it was 45 min wait. Then circled back to the meeting spot for the beefeater tour. Great tour with enough beheading to keep our teen boys interested. After that we went upstairs along the top of the wall. Great spot for pictures with the bridge in the background. ",so much history
"July 9, 2018",Much history in the Tower of London. If you are a fan of English history stopping by the tower is a must. ,Wonderful historic place with a gruesome past!
"July 7, 2018","An iconic piece of English history well worth the visit. Whilst the crown jewels are staggering there is so much more to the Tower of London. The history, the stories, the armoury and the old chapel is beautiful. We found going early to be there when it opened was well worth it to see the opening and miss the crowds.",Highlight of our trip
"July 5, 2018",Took the Yeoman Warder tour and it was a memorable experience.  Everyone enjoyed the attraction including my 11 year old.  ,Beautiful and very interesting
"July 3, 2018","Had 1 day in London, asked cabbie where to go, he said Tower of London, he was right. Pomp and ceremony, beef eaters and stories, Crown Jewels. History galore, meusem and lunch on site. A visit to remember. Thanks cabbie",Good history lesson
"June 30, 2018","This is a good London history lesson. It was interesting to see the torture devices as well as the castle defenses. It’s a lot of walking, so bring comfortable shoes! ",Beefeaters Galore!
"June 30, 2018","The Tower of London has a lot of great history but was very crowded and not easy to get to by the Tube. We joined the Beefeater tour, which is about 60 minutes. He covered a lot of interesting historical facts; all the Beefeaters were willing to take photos. Buy your ticket online to avoid lines.","Great, but don’t waste time on the tour"
"June 30, 2018","The Tower and the wonderful jewellery is a must to see and explore! Get the headphones so you can walk around this amazing place, but don’t waste your time on the guided tour! Take the tube to Tower of London and it an easy walk! ",Great attraction.
"June 27, 2018",Entry to this attraction was covered by the London Pass. We arrived at about 12:30pm and were surprised that we could walk straight in without queuing!There were quite a lot of people especially groups of junior school children on the day. They obviously cater for school children with special guides and lessons.It is difficult to see everything in detail so grab a map of the complex and plan your time. You could spend at least half a day here!The Crown Jewels and the torture room are the most popular and you may have to queue for half an hour at each. The White Castle and the Crown Jewels were my favourite part of the visit - also the mint.,Great old building but too busy
"June 27, 2018",Expensive tickets and even more expensive on your time to see anything like the dungeons or Crown Jewels. We gave up due to the heat and left. I am sure if you can catch a quieter day following the beef eater around would be great fun.,The Crown Jewels are beautiful and easy to see.
"June 27, 2018",Go early in the day as the lines to buy tickets and to get into the tower can be long.  The grounds of the castle are not crowded.  Usually there is a line to see the Crown Jewels but it goes quickly.  The jewels are outstanding!  They also explain who/when the various crowns are worn.  There are places to buy food.  Do not forget to see the ravens!  Some will be flying around in the castle and some will be in their homes.,Tower of London during Covid
"October 28, 2020","Really enjoyed the Tower of London and learning about the history, people and executions. We got in as part of a package deal so it worked out really well price wise. They make you wear a mask but that's to be expected with Covid-19 happening. Would recommend the Tower of London to anyone looking to learn more about British history or who wants to visit one of the best attractions in London.",Fantastic Day Out
"October 28, 2020","What a great day out. We went on Sunday and weren’t disappointed. It was FAR quieter than you’d normally expect but this only enhanced our visit, as it gave us lots of time to see everything, even saw the Crown Jewels twice, and there were no crowds at all. We felt extremely safe going and would highly recommend it.The staff were all extremely friendly & super knowledgeable. It was such he a nice experience to be able to chat to staff & ask lots of questions, which they answered with ease and gave us lots of other information, too. Thank you Luis (white tower) and Barry who chatted with us for a while and we’re so friendly with our children.We left through the shop at around 4:45pm and the lady on the door (ensuring capacity wasn’t exceeded) and lady on the till, were also extremely friendly. The service from everyone was exceptional. We’ll be back again in the very near future for sure.",Glad we visited
"October 27, 2020","I’d not been to the Tower of London for years so I’m glad we finally got around to doing this. Everything was efficient and well organised. Have to admit I was slightly underwhelmed by the Crown Jewels. Although the walkway moves slowly I didn’t feel there was time to fully take them in. Staff we met were all very engaging, informative and friendly.",Safe but disappointing during covid
"October 26, 2020","After an enjoyable  visit prior to covid restrictions when we had an excellent guided tour by one of the Yeoman guards, I wanted my granddaughters to have the same experience.  This was not to be as the tours have been suspended due to Covid safety restrictions. I abandoned  the audio guide as although the facts were given, it was dry and boring for teenagers.  There are Beefeaters dotted around the Towers who will answer any questions, but if you don't know the questions to ask.......My recommendation would be to delay a visit until normal service is restored in order to have a 5* experience ",Excellent day out
"October 26, 2020","Being a Londoner, we don’t often do activities like this as a family - we think of them as expensive, crowded and touristy. But given the Covid restrictions, we’ve been trying to see more of this marvellous city we live in  as well as support these venues. And I’m so glad we did! The Covid safety precautions here are great - timed tickets make entry seamless and it was just so well managed and clean, and smooth and uncrowded - brilliant for seeing everything, especially the crown jewels! The standout bit was just how friendly the staff are - the beefeaters are amazing of course, so knowledgeable and helpful. But every member of staff stood out as being incredibly good at customer service. Even when we left, we got chatting to a staff member who told us lots of gory extra details about the torture methods that happened at the tower - the kids loved it!",Great day out
"October 25, 2020","I am a Londoner who shamefully has never been to the Tower of London so we took today to visit.  It’s an incredible place with so much history and well worth a visit.  We hired the audio tour and it was well worth it, also the staff are always willing to answer questions if you want to ask.  There were absolutely no crowds which is a shame for the finances but fantastic for visitors as no queuing!",Fantastic 
"October 25, 2020","Booked tickets on the morning of visit very easy. Due to covid it was a lot quieter then I've been before but I felt it was better that way. Had time to visit all the aspects that are normally too busy, tho a couple of the attractions weren't open as not able to adhere to social distancing didn't spoil the day. ",A pleasure to visit
"October 25, 2020",On a very wet day and with fewer visitors to London with the present restrictions in place we enjoyed the space and lack of crowding.We have been to London many times over the years but have never visited thinking that crowds  gathering around the Crown jewels.What a joy to be able to visit without the crowds.   The Crown Jewels are spectacular and the other areas to visit within the grounds are so interesting.Should have visited long ago.,Disappointed
"October 25, 2020","I have wanted to visit here for years and I am very disappointed. I feel it's a dated exhibition. Much of this history is not explained in great detail and lots of the written text is repeated. The audio tour doesn't flow with the journey around the Tower. It would be better to have sited numbers which you select at certain areas. This would still enable the freedom to explore the historic building in your own order. The armoury is extremely confusing, the descriptions leave you to guess if anything is original armour or replica. Or if it was actually worn when it was suggested. The Tower has so much history, so much potential and it's really doesn't share this with the visitors as well as it could. Please update it. The staff, yeoman and cleanliness were excellent. Quality of Information sharing let's it down. ",Enjoy the space and sights!
"October 24, 2020","One of the strange upsides to visiting during these ‘Covid’ times is the lack of fellow visitors. If you’ve ever wanted to enjoy the Tower and all it’s history now is that time. We visited today, 11am on Saturday 24th October and enjoyed unrivalled access to many of the towers, grounds and of course the Crown Jewels. To visit these normally requires extended queuing, crowds and bustle with no time to enjoy. Today we could spend as long we wanted admiring royal treasures dating from centuries long past. The ability to stop and chat with unhurried and friendly Yeoman Warders was well worth the effort, they’ve always got tales to tell!Go while you can and enjoy the limited visitors and leisurely pace and progress around the Palace!",Good place
"February 11, 2018","Visited the tower of London in January 2018. At the entrance you will be handed over a map which contains the places and directions you need to take. It's pretty self explanatory. Ensure that you have sufficient time at hand to cover all places as I only had an hour with me (as the tower closed down at 5pm owing to winter in the country). The jewels are a must see! All the jewels that have been accumulated, including the famous Kohinoor and Cullinan diamonds are on display here. Photography inside is strictly prohibited.",Barbaric Political Intrigue!  Don't Miss It!
"January 30, 2018","First time visitors to London  --  DO NOT MISS THE TOWER!  History!  Ravens!  Great fancy costumes!  Decapitaion!  It's all there for the history buff, the architecture buff, or those just fascinated with Man's inhumanity to his fellow Man (and Woman!).  I took the self-guided audio tour, which was worth the money.  The guided tours seem great, too, but I arrived at the wrong time to catch one.  Plenty of pubs nearby to quench your thirst when you're done.",Heritage for sale
"January 29, 2018","We got as far as the price boards for admission.TWENTY EIGHT POUNDS EACH!SEVENTY POUNDS FOR A COUPLE AND THREE CHILDREN!FIFTY POUNDS FOR A COUPLE AND TWO CHILDREN!Well, I don't know about you, but I am just a working man on a day trip to the capital city.I simply can not afford these prices.A lot of our heritage (here I mean ALL of us) is locked up behind the Tower walls.If you want to see it.........PAY UP!",Must do!! 
"January 26, 2018",Tower of London is a must do while visiting. Definitely do the Beefeater tour. It is only 45 minutes and it gives a lot of history. Visit the Crown Jewels while you are there! ,History
"January 25, 2018","Visit to the Tower of London was most amazing choice I have made while deciding what to see during my stay in London. I vote the Tower of London the first thing to see, or if you can see only one thing than it has to be this. ",What a Glorious Place Indeed
"January 24, 2018",Great place for walking around and taking in the scenery.  Admission is included with the London Pass.  Worth it to see the Crown Jewels.  Many buildings here right beside one another to investigate.  London is so beautiful and truly the best place to visit in the world.  Had a memorable time.,LONDON TRIP 2016
"January 22, 2018","The whole experience was simply fantastic. everyone in London is so friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. the tower of London is a must see. your a bit overwhelmed but at the same time excited. I visited this in April 2016. ( so i would suggest visiting in April. and I did not visit in 2017)",Fascinating experience for kids - GO EARLY!
"January 19, 2018","First thing - if you aren't in line before 1100 for the Crown Jewels then think about going a different day - we got there at 1045, stood in line for 10 minutes and went through in a non-hurried, non-rushed manner - even got to circle back on the moving walkway to view the jewels from both sides - by the time we came out at 1145-ish, the line had, without exaggeration, multiplied by 10! It was already spilling into the courtyard. Go early, do the jewels first. then take the kids on the Beefeater Tour - my boys (13 and 9) loved all the bloody stories! It is a fun, informative tour.",Australians visiting family in UK
"January 19, 2018",Very good. The Beefeater (Yeoman) free tour is a must. Our guy was great. Very informative and entertaining. Used the 2 for 1 entry you get with a rail ticket. It was very quiet the day we went. ,Simply Fantastic
"January 18, 2018",Allow ample time to get around this gem. It's been 22 years since I last visited and still in awe! Couldn't find the dress up for a photo opportunity for the kids as had done in years gone by,Excellent Day Out
"March 13, 2018","Having watched the tours of the Tower on the Internet, the tour in person was great still. Our guide was Yeoman Sergeant Rob Fuller, a solid Ex Navy Chap, with great whit and humour, keeping your attention all the way through, this stunning site.  It was busy, but saw everything I wanted, great insight into both national and international history.  ",Surprised
"March 4, 2018",I had a free Day in London and thought I’d walk to get a picture of the tower. I ended up paying for the tour of the grounds and really enjoyed it. It was a bit pricey but the tour was interesting and seeing the Crown Jewels was cool. I would recommend this as a destination if you have time in London.,You have to go
"March 4, 2018","I had not visited the Tower since I was 7 years old, and was very favorably impressed.  I went on a cold day around 3:30pm during poor weather....and it was the perfect timing.  There was hardly anyone there, so I could go through the crown jewels twice with zero waiting.  I also enjoyed the armory in the Tower itself, and strolled along the walls, stopped by the chapel, and visited the old mint.  All this in what felt like a very leisurely 1.5 hours.  Super enjoyable to wander the grounds and enjoy the views over the Tower Bridge, etc.",Beefeater tour
"March 3, 2018","Knowledgable tour guides, amazing sites, terrific stories. We had an amazing talk in the chapel, the queens buried there and the reasons why. Well worth a visit. Don’t forget the 2 for 1 vouchers online!",Something you shouldn't miss
"February 28, 2018","Such a place to visit. Honestly, I was going to skip this place during my visit in London, yet I visited since I had free time in between my plans. I am so glad I visited. Amazing architectures gives you to experience London's historical atmosphere. The place was bigger than I expected and very stunning to see. View of the Tower Bridge from this place is another scene you can definitely enjoy. Make sure you give yourself enough time (i.e. about 2-3 hours) to tour this place and also check out the place from outside after the sunset.",The jewel of London.
"February 24, 2018","A visit to the Tower is a must. Located at the heart of London, you can take a 15 minute cruise from Westminster to reach it. It is almost 1000 years old and has rarities including the awe-inspiring royal jewels. I am sure you might not have seemed so much of gold and gem jewellery earlier. But it closes at 4.30 and you need at least 2 and a half hours to fully get a feel of it. So reach there in time. The entire staff here is Anglo-Saxon. No coloured or black people.",Go.  And make sure you do the tours.
"February 20, 2018","Second time visiting, still haven't nearly covered everything this amazing place to offer.  This time went for one of the tours by the Yeoman Warders which starts at the moat every half hour and ends in the chapel where Anne Boleyn is buried.  Do it.  They have a fantastic and detailed command of the history of the place and will deliver it each according to their own personal, highly entertaining and memorable idiom.  These folks tell a cracking yarn!  I've seen video of one of them holding forth and it was one of the funniest speeches I have ever seen.  YW Anderson today was no less talented - by turns hilarious, gory and tear-jerking, always genuinely interesting and informative.  There are interactive re-enactments in the grounds, random 'prisoners' roaming around who are happy to be waylaid and questioned, and the Warders throughout, inside the buildings and out, all of them super-friendly, entertaining, evidently in love with their jobs and and  extremely knowledgeable about everything from Jack Ketch to the eye-watering ablutory arrangements in the White Tower.  Impressive collection of weapons and armour, interactive exhibits for kids of any age, even delicious food in the cafe. This is a brilliant day out.",A must see
"February 18, 2018","We visited the Tower of London with the tour, but is unnecessary to do so. A wonderful place to see the crown jewels, and walk around.",If you love history.... or sparkly things- this is a cracking day out.
"February 15, 2018","A thousand years (and more) of history on display here, and winter, in term time, seems to be the perfect opportunity for a visit since there are no crowds, no queues and you can linger looking at the Crown Jewels for as long as you like with no hassle.Take one of the wonderfully non-PC tours with the Yeoman Warders, they are hugely entertaining and our guide (Spike) was very funny.",History books coming to life!
"February 15, 2018","1) You MUST do the Beefeater tour. 2) You MUST allow yourself enough time to walk around slowly, read everything, take it all in and ask questions.  3) This was the highlight of our week.  This is the thing you can't skip.  If you have only one day, pick it over the Palace.  It's just FASCINATING.  ","A must visit, lots to see"
"January 4, 2018","We loved this place, lots to see. So many towers to go through, one tower had actors performing it was very interesting. Plus you must go to see the crown jewels, lovely once in a lifetime type of thing. Lots of history, very educational.",Well it is everything you expect!  Amazing venue
"January 1, 2018","It was April, and with the weather crisp, this was still an amazing tour.  We arrived, and were able to get in quite quickly, and found that in about 3 hours, you could do it justice.  All the rooms are amazing, the crown jewels quite stunning and the white tower itself quite cool.  The Line of Kings is neat.",Worth the visit
"December 31, 2017",A place which you can spend half a day. This is the place you should visit if you like history. A nice place but be prepared for the walking and stairs. ,Must see with teens in London
"December 31, 2017",I think all 5 boys thought this was the best place we visited.  Plan on at least 3 hours.  Take your time but beware the ravens.,"Yeoman Warder Laurence, best guide ever. "
"December 30, 2017","We came specifically for this tour and were not disappointed. Informative, funny, fast moving and Laurence (forgive me if I spelt your name wrong sir) was the best. It's a must do for anyone visiting. ",Great stronghold
"December 30, 2017","We visited the Tower of London in October in a Friday afternoon. The queue was quite small, we bought the tickets and enter the stronghold in no time. The entrance fee is quite overpriced for what it offers, i.e. 24.8 GBP, however at the tickets office they will charge you a small donation, without asking first if you are willing to pay for it. Just tell that you do not want to donate any if you like so.The stronghold is well preserved and there are free guided tours at certain hours. You can visit a small coins museum, the crown jewels, an infantry museum, and the white tower with certain weapons and armors. You can have fun spending couple of hours visiting the stronghold and learn about its history, however you may be disappointed if you expect in great collections of art items, pictures, weapons or armory. Also the furniture is quite poor.I recommend the visit, although the entrance fees is overpriced.",The Ravens are HUGE!
"December 29, 2017","Great history, wonderful gift shop, amazing crown jewels, great tours and the ravens are enormous and a must see!",A must not miss destination if you're at all interested in history
"December 27, 2017","The Beefeater tour was the best part...they're engaging and passionate about sharing what they know with visitors. Even with rain / sleet, it was well worth the visit. The White Tour housed armor from through the centuries. ",Fun for All!
"December 24, 2017",Highly recommend visiting the Tower of London and taking the free Beefeater tour. Extremely entertaining at the same time informative. Even the young ones will stay entertained with the Beefeaters. The Crown Jewels was very impressive as well as the additional collections spread throughout the property. While this tower served a purpose many years ago it still houses 150 residents that include the Beefeaters who are decorated ex-military. While the ticket price is a little steep it is worth the visit. ,not so much fun for disabled.
"December 20, 2017","Great Place,, with lots of history that lifts you up in a historical vortex,So many stuff happened here, and so many people, high and low, passed trough here.",Glorified violence and propaganda as well as dull - will never go again
"August 18, 2017","I can honestly say I was truly underwhelmed/bored by the whole experience. The Yeoman Warder had a prickly disposition and a wry sense of humour - though with the large crowd and his rapid verbal pace, I could neither understand nor keep up. He took particular relish with the story of executions, beheadings and a severed head sewn back on - though peculiar & interesting, it's in questionable taste to glorify this for amusement/whatever sick purposes one has by getting a kick out of the macabre. Very touristy - waiting in the queue would've been worth it had there been anything of actual substance inside the towers. I didn't appreciate seeing all the artillery and drab slabs of information in microscopic text (talk about the lack of visual aesthetic) and got the vibe the British were somehow advocating/proud of their efforts in the war (when is that ever a good thing?). The crown jewels were not much to behold either. 1 star goes to the novelty moving travelator - it was the best part despite feeling like I was in a sausage/cattle factory. I truly regret wasting my time here (even more than the hole burnt in my hip pocket from the admission fee).",One of the highlights of our trip
"August 18, 2017",You can not come to London and not  visit the Tower of London.  Arrive as close to opening as possible and head straight to the crown Jewels so you avoid the lineups later in the day and then head back to the beginning.  Do not miss the entertaining Beefeaters story telling who will take you along on a historical journey as well as share funny antidotes.  Thoroughly enjoyed checking everything out.  We spent almost 6 hours here and worth every minute.,Buy your tickets online and have a great time
"August 18, 2017","To avoid the line, buy tickets on the web, pick up, and walk right in. The Tower was my favorite touristy thing to do in London. ",Lots to see and good value
"August 18, 2017",we bought our tickets in advance so cost for family to get in was very good compared to similar prestige locations. Team there were very good from the guides to the Yeomen... they have loud voices!! Obviously the Crown Jewels are fascinating but lots more to see and simply look at and imagine a thousand years of history... its all well presented and informative and not too commercial!!  ,History at its best!
"August 18, 2017","I wanted to visit the Tower of London ever since taking some English Civilization classes back in college and our professor got me so interested in English history and especially in the Tudor era. We reached the Tower and I was a bit scared by the long queue, but it moved really fast. Do not miss the Yeoman Warder guided tour! They start every 30 minutes on the left hand side right after the entrance and last about an hour. Clive, our guide, was so amusing, entertaining and offered so many valuable information about the Tower and its rich history. It is definitely the best way to take in all that the Tower has to offer and the only way in which you can step inside the Chapel St. Peter ad Vincula.",Join the Yeoman Warder Tour!!!
"August 17, 2017","One of the best sights to visit in London.  What made it special is the Yeoman Warder tour.  They start on the hour and half hour; you wait in the moat area for the Yeoman Warder.  Ours was a boisterous, bearded Yeoman Warder and he was fantastic.  The tour is only an hour and I wish it was longer.  Best of all, the tour is free, included in your ticket admission.  So be sure to take advantage and join a tour. Tower of London is quite a large area so you can easily spend 4-5 hours there.  The longest wait was the line to see the Royal Jewelry but the line moved quickly so not so bad.  The armory display is really cool; my teenage son enjoyed that a lot.  We had lunch in their cafe restaurant and quite surprisingly, it was quite good.  ",Living history!
"August 16, 2017",A stunning place full of history. The Crown Jewels are on display and they alone are worth the price of admission. ,7 Days in London
"August 16, 2017","Just one of the many wonderful sites to see in London, it didnt overly work for me personally but the Crown Jewell's were a sight to see and its a short distance to many other London attractions.",Wonderful and includes a free Beefeaters' tour too!
"August 13, 2017","We arrived soon after it opened and went directly to the jewels as recommended by Rick Steves and tripadvisor.  What a great move, no lines!  We then went on the 10:30 Beefeater tour and by the time we got back to the jewels building it was packed.  We were also lucky enough to watch the changing of the guards in front of the jewels - it was terrific!",It takes a full day to see it all.
"August 12, 2017",There is so much here. Arrive early and plan to spend the day wandering around and taking it all in. Get to the Crown Jewels early and don't be set off by the long lines. The cue moves quickly.,Of Course You Must Visit
"July 7, 2017","We took the Yeoman's tour (aka: Queen's Guard, aka: Beefeaters). They are all former British Military and live on premise. ""Shandy"" was our tour guide but I've heard positive things about all of them. Engaging and humorous even on a very hot, summer afternoon. Fascinating history about how people were buried within the tower site. The Crown Jewels and the history behind them should be on your agenda as well. We went into the White Tower built in the 11th century. It's really a museum to British armaments throughout history. What really fascinated me in the White Tower was St. John's Chapel, built into the 2nd floor by the Normans. Just didn't expect it and its history is interesting (to wonks anyway). The food at the Tower Café was good and we walked the ramparts. Well worth the learning you'll receive.",Landmark of London. A lot of History. Must see. White Tower is my favorite.
"July 7, 2017","Buy online tickets and go early because it's get crowded. The headsets work perfectly and without them you miss a lot of important information.  You may need 4 hours or more to see everything. The best in my opinion is the White Tower where there is  armory and games and be prepared to walk up a lot of stairs. The Crown Jewels exposition has long lines and it goes smooth. We learnt about the History of the Tower of London over the time, the animals imported, the life of kings, the insurrection, troops training, execution of spies, etc. We missed the torture chambers.",STILL THE BEST
"July 5, 2017","When in London, there are few experiences or places that can evoke such history and images of both death and life, medieval style , as the Tower of London does. As a complex, it is as beautiful as it is imposing. There is for Susan and myself, no other historical property in London that delivers so much value for money as this venue does. Plan to get in with a 2 for 1 entry of course, and plan to enjoy at least a half day here. Do see the Crown Jewels and do a Yeoman Warder tour if you can. The whole of it all should be seen, as it is not a cheaper entry. Get in before 2 pm in that they will close off sections at about 3:30, leaving you with just the glorious central White Tower to see and tour. This is of course the best part of the visit and is the place where so much history unfolded, you cant avoid the sensation of seeing these things of memory and lessons past pop into reality before your eyes. It is an exciting place to see and photograph, and even the areas around the complex by Tower Bridge and the Thames are wonderful to hang around at. The Ceremony of the Keys is awesome and having seen it 4 or 5 times, I am sad to see they put it online for tickets over the mail in requests of the recent past. This has put us all on a ridiculous waiting list of 2 years, so good luck seeing it now.  The Tower is a must see and do item, one can never tire of it.",Love it
"July 5, 2017","Get there early to really enjoy it without the crowd. Beefeater tour is free and great, but it is crowded in the summer. ",Go early 
"July 4, 2017","What a great day. Go early or at least within the first hour. Take the tour, it's included. Don't get too close to the ravens and of course, the jewels are stunning. ",Beefeater's Tour and Crown Jewels the bomb!
"July 4, 2017",Tour guide opens your eyes to the history and brutality of how England was ruled by dictators for centuries. Crown Jewels to torture chambers..you will see luxury and slavery life styles. The Beefeater tour guides provide insight and humor to a medieval era where heads were removed at the whim of the king or queen. Do this tour!!!,A Walk Through History
"July 2, 2017","I highly suggest getting the London Pass before visiting London.  With the pass, you get in a special line and get into the Tower quicker.  The first thing we visited was the Crown Jewels.  Luckily, we were one of the first ones in the building and got to spend time with the jewels and wasn't rushed.  I highly suggest getting a tour by one of the Beefeaters.  The Beefeaters has so much history about the Tower and took time to answer questions.  Spike was a wonderful guide.  The views of the Tower Bridge and the River Thames are wonderful from the Tower Walls.  This is a must see in London.",The highlight of any London trip
"July 1, 2017","I doubt anyone would possibly consider skipping the fabled Tower while visiting London for any tourism-related purpose. Expect to spend at least 3-4 hours there, plus another hour for an optional Yeoman tour and, alas, some extra time for the ticket line (the latter can be severely decreased by booking online). ",Great story telling 
"June 29, 2017",Make sure to wait for the beef eater guide just inside the gate for the guided tour and storytelling.   Ours was great making storytelling of chopping kings and queens heads off funny.  If there is such a thing.   Lunch was ok at the one place to grab a bite.  Don't get turned off by the long line to see Crown Jewels.  It goes quickly.  We were backed up to the lunch place still only took 20-25 minutes ,Go!
"June 28, 2017","The Tower of London is a must see for your visit to London. Definitely take the tour with the Beefeaters because they give you a real sense of the history of the tower (and they're funny and personable). They'll walk you through the key areas (traitors gate, the chapel, etc.) and tell great stories. You can spend the rest of the time exploring and meeting the ravens at your own pace. Two-three hours will allow you to see almost everything and there are great views of London Bridge. From the tube stop at Tower Hill, it's only a five minute easy walk to the ticket booth.",Loved it 
"June 26, 2017","This was worth very penny to get in. The Crown Jewels were magnificent, worth getting the audio tour as it improved the experience.",Very interesting ! Nice display of the crown jewels too
"June 26, 2017",We had a very interesting visit to the Tower of London. You get insight in the horrors of the history of the Tower. There is also the crown jewels on display. Very interesting. You get to see them up close. It is a incredible to see all the crowns and other things in reality.,"AVOID PRE-BOOKING, but an absolute MUST SEE!"
"June 24, 2017","We spend 4 1/2 hours in the Tower of London, and were absolutely immersed in everything. TIP 1: Get there AS SOON as it opens, to avoid the lines. GO STRAIGHT TO THE CROWN JEWELS, and DEFINITELY do a Yeowman Warders tour. Our Warder, Clive, was so knowledgeable, humorous and informative... to captivate such a large crowd, and keep engaged and entertained is an absolute credit to him!TIP 2: AVOID PRE-BOOKING. You cannot get into the venue with your e-ticket, you have to exchange it for a proper ticket at an additional counter... This line (even at 9am in the morning) was 3x longer than the general ticket booths. Although advertised as 'avoiding the line'... you're not. Rather false advertising.", Best tour
"June 22, 2017","Definitely take the Beefeater tour. Great experience, ends in their private chapel. We had Spike and he explains the history with so much personality. Answers questions amd engages the crowd. Lots of fun. ",This is why it's my favorite tourist attraction in the world
"June 21, 2017","The Tower of London has such fascinating history, and the best way to hear about it is with a Beefeater tour.  Our guide, Mr. Anderson, was informative and funny at the same time, which made everyone (including our teens) enthralled with what he was saying about the blood and gore of executions, dark connections to nursery rhymes, and Royal dramas. I didn't want our tour to end - I could've followed him around all day!  I love the juxtaposition of dark history with the stunning Crown jewels (worth the wait) in a castle right in the middle of the city!",Beefeater tour is awesome 
"June 18, 2017","Tower of London was one of our favorite things we did in London.  If you do nothing else, definitely take the Beefeater tour.  They are very good; both informative and entertaining.  Also, see the Crown Jewels.  We followed the advice of Rick Steves to get to the Tower in the morning at opening.  Then go right to the Crown Jewels.  See the rest of it later, and take the Beefeater tour later.  I think the Beefeater tours go every 30 minutes or an hour.  We had no line for the Crown Jewels by getting there early.  We noted a VERY long line a few hours later while taking the Beefeater tour.I didn't realize until we returned home that I had missed some exhibits and areas that we could have seen.  I had purchased a book from the gift shop which enlightened me to this fact.  Therefore, take your time and try to figure out everything there is to see.  I wish I had looked through my book more thoroughly at the time I purchased it, so I would have figured that out.  Nonetheless, it was a fulfilling visit that I enjoyed very much.",History and fun
"June 17, 2017","Our 2 kids loved the Tower of London (aged 9 and 7).  We ended up staying 3.5 hours which I didn't expectWe bought a Historic Royal Palace membership on the day , gets you access to 6 palaces , and if you do 2 then it is worth it + you get priority queuing.  TOL was not overly busy even though we went around 2pm and it was just after the large crowds had gathered for the 21 gun salute for Queens BirthdayHighlights for us were White Tower, Crown Jewels , and taking part in a humourous re-enactment ensembleNote in some areas you aren't allowed to film or take photos eg Crown Jewels But all in all, it was an interesting , educational and fun outing for the family",Beautiful gem in the city
"June 14, 2017","Neat place to see , especially with kids. There are many storytellers throughput the property and cool things to see",Great Tour
"June 13, 2017","If you go to the Tower, and you should, be sure to go on a guided tour. The guide was entertaining and informative. I was traveling with my college-aged daughter and she liked it as much as I did and she's not a lover of history like her mother. ",Awesome!
"June 13, 2017",Love this place! Got here right as it opened so it wasn't crowded. There's lots of stairs and climbing so if you're not up to lots of activity it probably isn't for you ,"Brilliant,Don't miss this one"
"May 14, 2017",I've always wanted to do this tour but never got round to it.We were on an open top bus run and arrived about 2.25pm.we had prepaid so missed the queue at the entrance.The tour is taken by Beefeaters who are very knowledgeable on the history and the talks are interesting with dates names etc and also funny with the mickey being taken out of the people on the tour.Its all ligh hearted stuff.It lasted about an hour and covers th periods from its first uses up to the present day.Groups ate made up of about 30 people.,"If you have time for only one site to see, this is the one"
"May 14, 2017","We got there early and spent about 4 hours at the Tower of London.  I suggest you see the Crown Jewels first before that section gets crowded. Afterwards, I was hesitant at first but my wife suggested we take the Beefeater tour.  It was great!  Engrossing facts and history of the Tower and England with lots of humor. We saw many, many sites and attractions in London and we both agreed that this was our favorite site during our 5 day visit.",Highly recommend to start the day
"May 13, 2017","My mom and I are in London from Canada and used our London Pass today. We started with the Tower of London because we had read that the lines could get long. We took the tube from King's Cross, where we are staying, right to the tower. There was clear signage that made it extremely easy to get to the entrance of the tower. We did not have to wait in a single line and found there were not very many people there when we arrived around 9:30 am this Saturday. We headed straight to see the Crown Jewels as we had also read that this usually has a long line. We were able to enter right away. It was a little frustrating inside as there is supposed to be no photography but a family that was near us kept pushing their way around and taking photos. This was not the fault of anyone else though. It seemed to be getting busier as we were leaving about an hour and a half later. ",This was a must-see destination
"May 12, 2017",We got in early as it opened and went straight to the Crown Jewels. We normally don't last more than 90 to 120 minutes at a destination but spend a full three hours at the Tower. Loved it. Lot's of history and great information. We went on the free tour and loved the insights about the Tower. ,Interesting
"May 11, 2017",A lot of history. Good visuals of items from history. My 13 year old nephew really enjoyed it as I did.,A must see in London
"May 8, 2017","I love English history so the tower was a must see. We did the Beef Eater tour and it was amazing, even if you are not a British history nut you will enjoy this experience.",must see
"May 7, 2017","You have to go to the Tower at least once.  Kids enjoyed it.  Very crowded on the day we went, long lines and couldn't get close enough to the Yeoman to hear the tour - which is usually excellent.  Buy tickets ahead of time or prepare to stand in line. ",Pleasant Go-At-Your-Pace Attraction
"May 6, 2017","My wife and I arrived to the Tower with concerns that it would be excessively crowded. It was not (Thursday afternoon). We used Rick Steve's London book for a self guided tour. The location is gorgeous. While some attractions were more historic or beautiful, this is a must see location for the combination of interesting information, historical significance, and great views. ",Such a fantastic place!
"May 6, 2017","This is a must see attraction in London! I suggest going in the morning as soon as it opens to beat the crowds. I also HIGHLY suggest joining the Yeoman Warder's tours. They operate every hour, are free, and are absolutely fantastic!",Buy tickets online. Go straight to the Crown Jewels.
"May 4, 2017","Go early. Buy a ticket online, print it out, and avoid the long lines in buying a ticket. If you want an audio guide, you can reserve that online as well. Do it to avoid the long lines. Once you enter, go straight to the Crown Jewels because the lines here can get really long.",The Yeoman Warders are great tour guides
"May 2, 2017","This is a must do attraction in London.  Definitely join a tour by a Yeoman Warder, and keep an eye out for the ravens.",Trip down London history
"April 30, 2017","We (me and my son) had a great time at the tower. When we got in we listend to the wards who learnt us a lot about the history of the tower and the other buildings, with great humor. The crown jewels and the castle ravens makes it a great visit. ",Amazing 
"April 29, 2017","Highly recommended the audio tour, then the beefeater tour, both excellent, would suggest get there early, do the crown jewels first!  Or you are going to que alot!  Then do beefeater or audio tour, but do both, and then go a second day to see all the stuff you could not fit in on the first!  Amazing place!  Totally happy with our visit, and not stupidly expensive!  worth every penny ",A wonderful place to visit
"April 28, 2017",If you're going to London a stop at the tower is a must. I think most people know what the Tower of London is so here are some tips for a good visit:-Go midweek when the crowds will be smaller. -Go early and allocate at least half of the day. There is a lot to see.-Go see the Crown Jewels FIRST before the queue gets too big. -After the Crown Jewels go back to the moat at the entrance and take the Beefeater tour that leaves every 30 mins until half 3. The tour lasts about an hour and it will give you some great info about the tour. It's free. While on the tour pick the places you want to go back to see in detail. - Think about bringing a packed lunch to save money as the cafes can be expensive. ,Amazing history!
"April 27, 2017","Spent 3 hours here and totally worth it! Beefeater tour amazing with James woodcock! He was entertaining, informative and made the history easy to understand. So much to see here !",Filled with history
"April 27, 2017","There's lots to see and do. Little boys will love the armours, knights and weapons and little girls the crown jewels! For grown-ups there's lots of interesting facts and even without taking a tour one can get a good overview.",History and fun
"April 23, 2017",My young boys really enjoyed it as they imagined what it would be like to live 400 years ago.  The armor was a higlight and we enjoyed the reenactment of the 4 groups who attempted to breach the walls.,"Gory tales, history and heritage"
"April 17, 2017","Take the tube to Tower Hill and the ticket booths are a short walk away. If you can, take a tour with one of the Beefeaters in their distinctive tunics and hear their absorbing tales of the past. It concludes in the historic chapel, which is the last resting place of three of Henry VIIIs wives who were executed at The Tower, Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard and Lady Jane Grey.The ancient central tower houses armour and weaponry, but the biggest attraction must be the Crown Jewels belonging to the monarch and including the crown, orb and sceptre used in the Coronation ceremony since the 1600s. Expect to have to queue, but the line moves quickly and once you reach the exhibits themselves you can spend as long as you wish viewing them.Expensive, particularly the new café. For economy take a picnic. The admission is still good value and the attraction is well worth a visit. Expect to spend at least 3 hours to see it all.If this review was helpful, please be kind enough to click the button below.",Awesome tour!
"April 14, 2017",The history is amazing.  The Crown Jewels alone are worth the price of admission.  Recommend getting a Historical London Palace pass to save time waiting to buy aticket.  The Beefeater tour is a must!,Fun History
"April 13, 2017","This was an interesting site, full of history and intrigue. It is easy to leisurely stroll through and choose which areas to visit. Plan on about two hours to see it. I followed a Rick Steves tourbook recommendation and it was perfect. Purchased our tickets in advance on the website to avoid the lines, and arrived early. Start at the crown Jewels and then head back to catch a Yeoman Warder tour which is both entertaining and insightful. After that, view the other sites where the crowds aren't as large.",Wonderful Beefeater led tour of history
"July 10, 2020",I have been wanting to visit the Tower of London for many years but just never got round to it. Me and my boyfriend visited here for his slightly belated birthday treat. We joined one of the free tours and were very happy with it. Our Beefeater was funny and informative and I think slightly overran. He was very passionate about it. After the tour we wandered around visiting the Crown Jewels and was impressed by the collection and the innovative use of a travelator. We also did the tower. There is so much to do I’m not sure we did it all but we did upgrade to membership for the year as it was only £20 more to do so for a joint one. Well worth a trip! ,a good day out
"July 1, 2020","This was my daughters choice for her birthday I wasn't sure I would enjoy it but it was amazing, I loved the role players, changing of the guards, history of the raven, the tower itself with it's sad stories.  I really would allow a day to see it all. ",So much to see and do here
"June 26, 2020","This was a great way to spend a portion of our day. Start with the Beefeater tour to get some information about the history of the area. They're funny and give a lot of details in a short amount of time. There's a little bit of everything to be found here, especially if you find the medieval era, monarchy, armor, jewels, architecture, swords, churches, palaces, ravens, and amazing views interesting. It is easy to spend hours wandering around to all the different buildings and displays. For those with disabilities, there are stairs in several buildings so getting around will present some challenges.",Tower of London
"June 25, 2020","Thoroughly enjoyed the Tower of London. Best to join a tour (Beefeaters give a free guided tour of the Tower every 30 minutes) or read up to understand its history, the symbolism, how it was used (fortress, palace, prison) and the stories of what happened in the various areas of the property. The Crown Jewels exhibit is particularly popular, so the queue is long.",Lovely Historical Place In The City 
"June 24, 2020",Went with my son and early January this year and we were very impressed with the architecture and the up-keeping of the tower plus the Royal jewellery that was in exhibition at the time. It was lovely to see the grounds are well managed m by the resident workers and was unchanged from when the Tower was occupied. We enjoyed meandering through the buildings and passage way. I’ve been here twice but still love it.,Spooky experience
"June 21, 2020","We went here a while ago so bit of a late review. But anyway we really enjoyed this. Absolutly brilliant. Obviously there is history and lots of things to see. Our favourite bit was the guy that was dressed as a Lord and was telling us how his mattress was made. We also got some great photo shots of the skyscrapers in the background, contesting the old of the towers with the modern of the city. One thing that's going to sound really weird is that one of our Party thought they felt a Ghostly presence. Sounds a bit crazy but in one of the rooms we were looking at an alter and then she smelt a rotting body and she had this overwhelming sense of dread. She freaked out and we had to Leave and she refused to return. Then we found out later that the exact spot she was standing next to was where someone was murdered.. Spooky?",Interesting Historical Location
"June 21, 2020","This is an interesting and educational site to visit. There is something for adults and children. Recommend arriving early and purchasing tickets online. If you want to see the crown jewels, GO THERE FIRST! The lines tend to be long. It is worth taking the free large group tour of the site, then I suggest exploring on your own. I loved the ravens!!",great place to visit
"June 20, 2020","I loved the history here. The staff is wonderful, informative, proffesional and helpful. There is something here for all people of all ages and all interests. The other guests were friendly and respectful. As an American I found it interesting to see a UK view on US/UK history.",Very informative tour
"June 20, 2020","We managed to visit just before the lockdown.  It was a very informative tour with Yeoman warder very jovial,and friendly.  We enjoyed seeing the Crown jewels afterwards with well organised queues.  We also very much enjoyed the lunch in the cafe.  A thoroughly enjoyable experience",A lot of history
"June 20, 2020","This castle is great with the guides who live there and they give you free tours because they do it in good will they are great and funny.They tell you the history of London and the tower (more than they make you interpret what they tell) every place to and very good people, the crows are charismatic and pole in one of the towers and two people who interpret the day that the king had, etc.In question it is one of the best things that I have visited and although you are disabled you can go since there are tickets for people in wheelchairs and it is totally worth the price.",Amazing historical site 
"January 6, 2017","Visited the Tower of London on Thursday 6th January and it wasn't too busy. I used my 2-4-1 train ticket offer so it only cost £25 for 2. Started with a free tour at 11am with a fantastic, knowledgeable Yeoman. I was very impressed with his information about the Tower and it made my visit more worthwhile. Then after the 1 hour tour I  spent the next 3 hours taking my time visiting everywhere else in the grounds of the castle. Towards the end of the day I picked up another free tour by another professional,  male staff member in the White Tower which lasted 40 minutes and was great too. There were no queues anywhere, so I think I fell lucky. The toilets on site were great, the grounds immaculate and the cafe had great coffee/cake  (did find the cafe extremely cold).  Highly recommended if you are visiting London. I think the Tower of London is more suitable for older children. As an adult attraction it is fantastic.",Informative-Historical
"January 4, 2017","Definitely worth a visit, large structure - may take 2 to 2 1/2 hours to see everything, crown jewels located here.",buy tickets from London Transit tourist office
"January 3, 2017","We went to the Tower during Christmas holidays. The crowds were horrendous. 30-45 minutes to get in, 60 minute wait once we were in to see the Crown jewels.TIP: You can buy a ticket in advance from a London Transit tourist office (in train stations). This allows you to skip the ticket line (BOTH the line to buy tickets the same day, AND the line to pick up tickets if you bought them on-line or through a third party). Even better, our family ticket was a few pounds cheaper than the regular price. You do, however, still have to stand in the long entrance queue. Was it worthwhile? Yes - the Yeoman's tours are great (funny, informative), the jewels one of those 'gotta see' things, the armoury a delight for kids, Edward's apartments a fascinating look into 13th (14th?) century life, and amazing views of Tower Bridge.",Terrific Tower!
"January 2, 2017","We went between Christmas and New Year which is a very busy time. Best advice is pre-purchase tickets (the dates have 90 days flexibility) and go there at opening time. Skip the audio guides and anything else and go straight to the Crown Jewels. We were in within minutes! The line later in the day was crazy and taking over 1 and a half hours to get in. After the Crown Jewels, double back to near the entry and go on the free Yeoman guard tour. We all loved it. Our guard Bob was informative, engaging and funny. Even my teenagers thought it was fantastic!  After the tour we went to the White tower, still not so busy as most people were in the line for the  Crown Jewels. After that we explored at our leisure and had a nice lunch in the cafe. Definitely a must see attraction!",Crown jewels was the highlight
"January 2, 2017","Aim to go in the morning- it was very crowded during our visit.  There were many queues for ticketing and the crown jewels, and the buildings closed early, around 3 or 330pm.",Must See Attraction
"January 1, 2017","Adult £25 at the entrance but £20 when purchased on line. The £5 you save, spend it on the self guided audio, which gives you the history of the tower. Admission includes access to the royal jewels and tower of London. To avoid the long lines, it is highly recommended that you arrive at  entrance when it opens. Expect 3-4 hour visit. Great cafe. Staff are friendly!",Not recommended
"January 1, 2017","I don't recommend teenagers like me to go there unless you like history because i found it quite boring and the ticket fees are quite expensive so you would be wasting your money if you are not into history. The only place in the Tower of London i find worth seeing is the Crown Jewels.Ethan, 13y.o.",Tradition is awe inspiring.
"December 26, 2016",Signed up for tour via Viator and did first morning. Experienced the opening of tower and the tradition of beef eaters. Caught the Crown Jewels before it became crowded. Lovely experience and grounds.,A must see
"December 25, 2016",A piece of British history that should not be missed. We've been many times over the years and it never disappoints. It's very organized and updated now compared to our first visit over 25 years ago. Do some reading about this landmark before you go. The stories that go with this should not be lost.,Tower of London - History and gore!
"December 20, 2016","As a family of 4 we recently visited the the Tower of London and had a very entertaining trip around this famous historic attraction. Close to local Tubes and buses the sight is easy to access and ticket purchase quick and easy. As its winter the number of visitors was low which made entry and walking around pleasurable. We had a great Beefeater tour guide (RSM Dave) who made the morning very enjoyable and recommend you follow one of these complimentary guides. History and gore is the basis of this visit, so off with his/her head and torture by the rack is the name of the game. English blood letting at its best!","This is a ""do not miss attraction!"""
"March 26, 2017","This was one of the highlights of our trip. When you get there, go see the Crown Jewels first. Then, take the tour through the White Tower (they only had 3 of these the day we were there).  Then, go back to the front and go on a tour with the Yeoman Warder. They start every 30 minutes throughout the day and it was the only way to get into the chapel. Tons of history!",Awesome Afternoon
"March 23, 2017","I'm just going to contectualise this by saying I love the medieval history of London so I'm probably a little biased, but the whole Tower of London experience was awesome!We went on a beautiful sunny afternoon and managed to sneak in just as one of the Beef Eaters (the guide/guard) named Spike was starting the tour. The guided tour lasted about 30 mins and went into the history both the buildings themselves and the happenings within the buildings during the first half of the second century. Spike was a fantastic speaker and we learnt a lot!After that we spent a good few hours having a look at all the other parts of the tower; the Crown Jewels and history of the monarchy, armory (weapons and armor from the year 1000 to now), the history of the soldiers themselves during the multiple wars fought in and by London (again between 1000-now) and simply taking in the views and reveling in the knowledge that everything around us was pretty much the same as it was 1000 years ago.It's a little pricey as far as tours go but I'd highly recommend putting aside a few hours and seeing it!",Absolutely brilliant!
"March 20, 2017","In the over 20 years I have been living in or visiting London I have never been here. In fact, I avoided it as I thought it would be gruesome or some-such. I arrived early, went straight to the Crown Jewels before the crowds arrived and then took a Yeomen of the Guard tour and just wandered through the whole place. It was endlessly fascinating and I'm so pleased I finally took the plunge. I spent an astonishing six hours within the walls. The ravens are supermodels and the Yeoman tour was fascinating and hilarious. A definite must-see in London!",Classic London Attraction
"March 19, 2017","I attended a tour led by a Yeoman Warder and found it very enjoyable. I wish I could remember his name, but all I can really remember is that he was bald and very entertaining (I know that is basically useless information, sorry). I highly recommend going on a tour with a YW because it greatly enhanced my experience of the Tower of London. I learned so much more than if I had just walked around reading plaques.I didn't have to wait too long to see the crown jewels as I went in  February but I can imagine that the line can be ridiculously long in the summer. I'd recommend going early in the morning to avoid the line.A great attraction for all tourists. It's good for families, history buffs, and those that just love British culture.",Online tickets 
"March 18, 2017","We bought our tickets online having seen the terrific queues to buy tickets and missing out in the past. we queued to get in to then be told our paper tickets (which were printed at home) must be taken to the ticket office & exchanged, before we can enter. This was a source of frustration for us and many other tourists. Luckily we were early but I heard some other poor people being turned away as we left when the queue was very long. Buying tickets in advance becomes pointless when you need to wait to get them anyway. ",A shame that you can't take photos of the Crown Jewels.
"March 16, 2017",A fascinating historical site that has interesting buildings and information throughout. Unfortunately photos are not allowed when observing the Crown Jewels. They would rather you buy books than take photos.,"Crown jewels and lots of history, worth the trip!"
"March 4, 2017","Get here early enough to do a full tour either with audio guide or Beefeater (best), we got there a little too late in the day, about 2:30 so didn't get through the whole audio tour after seeing the crown jewels-- they close at 4:30pm (in February when we went.) Crown jewels were spectacular, and it is amazing to walk some of those historical hallways and see the old carved graffiti in the tower walls! ",Must see while in London
"March 4, 2017",Billy the Beefeater was entertaining.  It rained the day we went so he took us to the Chapel and told us the history and was thouroughly enjoyable.  He cracked a few jokes and answered historical questions.  Every member of the staff was knowledgeable and eager to speak in depth about the history and culture.   ,Take a Beefeater tour
"March 2, 2017",What a thoroughly enjoyable place it is. You can spend a day here and still not take it all in. It is steeped in history having served the Kings & Queens of England since 1066. The crown jewels and all of the Queens regalia are stored here and you have to see them to believe them. My tip would be to do a free Beefeater tour to learn more about the goings on here. Incredibly fascinating.,"Well worth a visit , History is Fun "
"March 1, 2017","Our first time on a social visit to the city , this was recommended, and well worth it at a cost of £25 per adult .On a cold Sat morning in Feb , there for the 10 am tour (that's a must with the Beefeaters) and was a real highlight of our short weekend stay . Beefeater Dave made this tour real 'Fun' and a great history lesson .  Next time taking the kids ""Be early or book your tickets in advance , cause even in Feb the queues are long at 0900hrs on a cold Sat morning .",Great
"February 4, 2017",So worth a visit i traveled with my 6 year old so avoided some of the scarier things but still fantastic a lot of steps in parts but it is to be expected. Fantastic views and heaps of history completely loved it,Superb day out
"January 29, 2017",This is great value for money. The Beefeater guided tour is a must. Our guide Kevin was hilarious! There is so much to see and do make sure you plan a full day to see this site in its entirety. The onsite cafe had good choice and the food was reasonably priced. Make sure you dress warm in winter most of the day will be outside or in non heated areas.,"If you pick one thing to do, this is it!!"
"January 28, 2017",We had a great time at the Tower of London. History buffs will absolutely love it. We could have spent all day here. Our beefeater (Spike) was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. This was our favorite thing we did in London.,"Lots of lovely shiny things to see, but lots of history to absorb too"
"January 22, 2017","Lots of lovely shiny things to see, but lots of history to absorb too.  Picture with Beefeaters and ravens - then the gift shop!",Fabulous experience 
"January 20, 2017",Highly entertaining and informative. Our guide Jason Wilcock made the experience enjoyable. Worth the visit ,"History buffs unite! Especially if you relish the love, murder & betrayal of the royals"
"January 14, 2017","The Tower of London was a central location for all of the scandal, murder & promiscuity of the royals & thus, a must-see if you really want to experience London. The entrance fee does sound steep, but it's worth it if you are a history buff...and if you aren't, The Tower of London just might make you one.We went on a cold November day so there were no lines & we could move about the Tower as we liked. We paid for the headsets - $4 - well worth it. When you are done there, take a stroll across the Tower Bridge & then cross back & walk a few minutes to Katherine's Dock for a nice lunch.",What an amazing place
"January 14, 2017",If you're into history or architecture (or jewels) this is a must see!  Definitely wait for a yeoman tour. Their knowledge and presentation are amazing.  We had the good fortune of meeting Yeoman Spike and his wife Lisa  at a pub when he was off duty.  He made our trip to London so special!  These men are the true jewel of the Tower!  Make sure you view the history of the Crown Jewels before seeing them.  Especially note the Cullinan diamond. I had to go back through the Crown Jewel exhibit after my first tour because these diamonds were so big and clear that I completely missed them! the first time.,You have to go !
"January 11, 2017",The Tower is an amazing experience -   suggest you get there early and do the Crown Jewels first - the queue at the end of the day was very very long. We ate at the restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised  at the food choices and the quality. ,Not to be missed
"January 10, 2017","You really can't go to London and not come to the Tower of London, I love this place. The history, the Crown Jewels etc. I really enjoyed the audio guide and if you are a history buff I'd definitely recommend the guide!",Female Yoeman Warder
"January 9, 2017","On a recent trip to London with a friend, I took the tour of the Tower of London again.  While always interesting, this time the tour was given by the only female Yoeman Warder.  What a treat.  ","Beautiful Day, Ruined by ""Mercy"""
"August 21, 2016","My husband and I had spent an amazing, beautiful,perfect day at The Tower of London...until closing time.As we were leaving, he developed a horrible cramp in his hip and had to sit down. Immediately, a ""resident guard"" named Mercy, rushed over to tell us that we had to leave. We explained why he had to sit for a moment, but he didn't care...at all....telling us that he couldn't go home until we left....What? I tried to stall him by asking for a picture, but that didn't work....As my husband and I slowly made our way to the exit, my husband asked about the very young guards...and if their guns were real.""Mercy"", being a total, complete, disrespectful moron says...quote, ""Of course they're military. They're infantry. We don't give guns to anyone and everyone like you Americans do. That's the problem with you Americans...everyone has a gun"".Wow......",Yeoman tour of the Tower of London
"August 20, 2016","We took the yeoman tour when visiting the Tower of London. You do not have to pay extra for this tour, but it is very popular and often crowded. Our guide was Jason Woodcock. He was an excellent guide, interesting and very informative, and full of humour! We really enjoyed our tour with him. Thanks to his booming voice, everyone could hear his insightful commentaries, even though our tour was quite crowded. If you take this tour, allow a minimum of 2 hours to visit the Tower. ",Must visit 
"August 16, 2016","Of the tourist attractions I visited in London, this was definitely among the most worthwhile. The history of this place is amazing. Make sure you get on a guided tour, I could honestly say that the tour guide I had was one of, if not the best I have experienced. They are very passionate and really bring it all to life. ","Nice introduction into the history of London, a must visit"
"August 15, 2016","Very well setup, but of course extremely touristy. It gives you a very nice introduction of the history of London. ",Stand in the site of so much history.
"August 14, 2016","Definitely take the tour, every room has a unique and large amount of history.  The crown jewels are amazing to see in person, they took my breath away.  ",Doesn't live up to the hype
"August 14, 2016","Maybe we didn't enjoy this as much because we were at the end of our stay and we were exhausted but I was not overly impressed. The Crown Jewels were cool but you don't get to view them for long, it seemed like they could have done more with the torture tower and the other exhibits. The Yeoman tour was nice, you should be respectful of these men, they aren't just tour guides! This is an honor position for the men who served in the military. ","You go to the Tower if you go to London, PERIOD."
"August 14, 2016","A must if you go to London! The Beefeaters are part of the pleasure. Ours was extraordinary. Funny, loaded with anecdotes and great historic facts. Of course the Crown Jewels were exquisites. We were there early afternoon and did not have to wait that long, perhaps 20 minutes. There is also a great Fish & Chips just before entering the tower if you are hungry for a quick bite! Melted right into your mouth :) We also bought a few things at the Gift Shop. The way we got there was with the cruise, and we left with the Original Bus Tour. Convenient, and also two different ways of approaching the landmark. ",Weekend at London
"August 12, 2016",Very interesting historical site. Well kept.The Crown Jewels is the main event.A must see in London. ,A wonderful historic place to visit
"August 10, 2016","Definatly well worth a visit, the beefeater tour is a must to appreciate everything there is to see. I would recommend pre booking to avoid the queues",A well done historical site
"August 8, 2016","This is a very well done--if expensive--historical site to visit.  I highly recommend the extra pounds for the audio tour.  You can pick and choose what you se and listen to, and we learned so much more from the tour. We bought our tickets online which saved us standing in line and it was cheaper. We also arrived at opening on a Sunday morning.  Our nearly 3 hours there were quite pleasant; the only line was for the crown jewels (and it went pretty fast).  My teenagers (14 and 16) enjoyed it and so did my mother.  It was good for all generations.  The displays and narration are well done, the exhibits are well organized, and crowd flow is managed. I recommend it. ",Relive history
"August 4, 2016","Loved seeing so much of history in one place.  Did an overview of the Tower of London by taking a tour with London Walks.  They talk about the building get of the tower and all the history that has occurred here, highlighting the places where the prices in the towers bodies were found, where Anne Bolyen and others lost their heads, where the prisoners were kept, and the Famous Ravens.  They leave you to see the crown jewels and continue on your own.",Great experience 
"August 3, 2016",I went with a group of friends and family to the Ceremony of the Keys. The guard who walked us through it was very knowledgeable. The whole ceremony only takes about 30 minutes but definitely well worth it. Would recommend booking this well in advance as it books out quickly and they don't allow very many people on this tour.,Love the audio tour
"August 2, 2016","Purchasing the audio tour guide was worth it. Loved doing the tower at our own pace.  There are group tours by a live tour guide, but it can be very busy and loud.   So hearing the guide can be difficult.  Easy to spend 2 or more hours.  Go 1st thing in the morning to see exhibits and avoid the crowds. ",Amazing History and Diversity of Activites
"July 31, 2016","Returning here after several years, so that my mother could visit as well.  We arrived here shortly after it opened.  We made a beeline to the crown jewels, which was definitely a great idea.  We were able to walk around them a couple times due to the lack of crowd.  Following our visit there, we returned to near the entrance to take the Yeoman Warder tour.  The tour was information and entertaining.  We had a large group of people from around the world in the tour from South Africa to the Americas, and all were included.  Definitely made for a memorable visit.  Following the tour we went through a couple of the exhibits.  I wish we had a bit more time to visit, but wanted to get a few more things in today.An amazing feature of the Tower to me is the diversity of activities.  There seems to be something for every age and every interest.",Yeoman Clive and his 1 hour tour
"July 30, 2016","If you get a chance to have a guided tour while at the tour, definitely try to find Yeoman Clive! He conducted our tour of the Tower at 10 am. He was very informative, loud, engaging, and patient with an unruly, over-questioning child.  Mad props to Clive and the other yeomen who are former military and the queen's body guard!",Historical place 
"July 28, 2016","A great place to explore and learn about history of England. The guards' tours are exceptionally fantastic with the right amount of British humour.  It might sound rather expensive at about 22 £ but if you buy a membership for about 40£ you get free access to 5 royal palaces, including Banqueting palace in London. Or you can try to find slightly cheaper tickets online. Make sure to allocate a long time to this excursion because there are many things to see and several different tours to take part in. You can spend a whole day there and have a picnic in the moat!  ",The Guided Tour is Excellent
"July 27, 2016","I was lucky enough to enter the Tower of London grounds just a few moments before a free guided tour began.  My guide spoke loudly, knew how to lead a large group, and told a story of the Tower of London in an entertaining manner.Women seem intrigued by the Crown Jewels.  I found them uninteresting, but it may be worth waiting in the long line just so you won't feel that you've missed anything.I liked the White Tower, which had many displays of arms and armor.",Give yourself plenty of time
"July 27, 2016","We went as a part of a morning tour which was great to get your lay of the land, but we found ourselves wishing we had more time.  The beefeater's intro is short and good.  They tend to point you towards the crown jewels, which was neat to see (and like the fact they have a conveyor belt to keep the gawkers moving along), but we wish we would have hit the white tower up front as there were so many levels and a lot to take in.",Just as good second time!
"July 22, 2016",Visited this attraction only yesterday having been here 14 years ago. It was just as enjoyable this time with two of our children. Fantastic tour guide Dave the Beefeater was our guide and as before the Beefeaters make great tour guides of the tower. Big number of visitors but no queuing. So much history to digest. We spent approximately three hours at the Tower of London as it was a beautiful day a must see when in London!,Excellent 
"July 22, 2016","Started off with a Yeoman Warder tour where we were guided around for about an hour by the excellent Jaise. It was an entertaining and informative tour and left us in the middle of the tower grounds just outside the Chapel. Continued on with the arms exhibition inside The White Tower, then on the the Crown Jewels and finally ended it with a bit of a walk on the walls. I'm not much for jewels but the arms display was impressive - don't miss it, and don't miss the Yeoman Warder tour either. Definitely one of the more interesting things to do in London. ",A Must Visit
"September 17, 2016","Not only is the Tower amazing, but the layout, the guides, the maps, the tours... it's so well organized and efficient and detailed.  The audioguides were fantastic, and I spent 4 hours wandering the complex without every losing interest (or getting lost). A tremendous font of history, culture, religion... anyone who is Anglo must visit- so much of our nation's history is tied up in this one area. Tip: get there early right when it opens.  It gets more and more crowded as the day goes, but at 9am it was the best!Second tip: listen to the Beefeaters.  They are amazing men with great storytelling ability.  You will be glad you did!","Amazing, make sure you do the Yeoman Warder Tour"
"September 13, 2016","An amazing place to wander around. The Crown Jewels are just spectacular, although be prepared for a very long wait. The queue was long but well worth the wait. The shops have the usual souvenirs as well as some beautiful although over my budget items. The ravens are great and well worth a visit. I cannot recommend highly enough a Yeoman Warder Tour. If you are lucky enough to get Billy the Beefeater you will be in for a treat. He is funny, informative and highly entertaining and I could quite happily listen to him for hours, make sure you bring your best smile as he takes photo's of you to put up on twitter! ",Played a major  role  in English  History
"September 12, 2016","Even if  you  are  not  a follower  of  English history, walking  past  the Traitors  Gate as you  enter  the  Tower  of  London  is bound  to  have  some  affect on you. Reflect  on the number  of  people  who  entered  through  the  gate  and died  there. The  huge ravens  strutting  around  the  grounds, the presence  of  Beefeaters  and Queen's  guards helps set the  tone. The  Tower  was originally  a  castle, which  became  a  jail. It was built  in  the  9th  century  but  has been  well  preserved.Be sure  to  take  a tour  with  one of  the  Beefeaters. Their knowledge  of  history  makes  the  Tower  come  alive  and  embellishes what  you  already  know. While  the  price  of  entry  is a bit steep $34.USD, there  is  no  extra  charge  for  the  tour. Make  sure  to  visit  Beauchamp  Tower  where  many  were  held  before  they  were  executed. Anne  Boleyn  stayed  here. There  is  graffiti  on the  walls  left  by prisoners. They  have  created  a  circular  ring listing  those  who  lost  their  head  outside  Beauchamp  Tower. It used  to be just a stone  spot  marked by a sign  The  chapel  can  be  visited  only  on a  Beefeaters  tour. I was told  to  join  in with  a  tour  if I  wanted  to  go  inside. I wanted  to  spend  extra  time  looking  at  the  Crown  Jewels  so I  stepped  off the  conveyor  walkway  used to  shuttle  people  past  the  jewels  and took a  second  ride  on the  other  side.There  is  an entire  building  filled  with  armor, weapons  and stories  about  those  who  lived  in  the  Tower rooms. You  can  spend  a long  time  in this  building  alone. I think  you  have  to plan  on at least  2-3 hours  at the   Tower  of  London. I believe  that  admission  might  be  part  of  the  London  Pass. Since  I was  here on a bus  tour, I didn't  research  that. This  is  my  second  trip  here and  felt  like  I  learned  more  on this  trip. It is  a  very  important  piece  of  English  history.","History, Beauty and Ravens"
"September 12, 2016","This is a beautiful introduction for foreign visitors to the rich history of Britain and the monarchy. Situated along the Thames a stone's throw from Tower Bridge, the Tower of London is a series of towers, many of which are connected through a perimeter wall. Do plan to spend at least a couple of hours to ensure you have the chance to visit several of the structures.  Tours are offered by yeoman warders regularly throughout the day and should not be missed. The Crown Jewels were worth seeing, but I loved that many of the structures were open to the public. One can walk virtually the entire perimeter along the wall encompassing the compound. There is a raven master and several ravens maintained on the grounds, often visible to the public. If you plan far enough in advance (a very long time in advance) you may be able to obtain tickets to the key ceremony, which is held at the end of the day when the tower grounds are locked and night guard is posted. Several yeoman warders (aka Beefeaters) have Twitter accounts where they share gorgeous pictures of the grounds. One of my favorite places in London! A word of caution, be prepared for significant crowds during local school holidays!",Must for History Buffs in London
"September 12, 2016","This is a must stop for anyone interested in medieval london. The White Tower in the middle is almost 1000 years old. The Crown Jewels are here and the exhibit that houses them has recently been redesigned to be much more interesting. Its full though like everyday, so do yourself a favor an order at ticket online so you don't have to wait so long in the lines. And skip the beef eater tours which actually run to like 100 people and just do the audio tour. Totally worth it. ",Bursting with History
"September 9, 2016","This is probably the oldest building in the world that I've been in. It's hard to picture all the history that took place at the Tower of London. The Crown Jewels, the Ravens, the Beefeaters are a sight to see.",My Favorite Attraction in London!!1
"September 9, 2016",Make sure you take to tour with the Beefeater Guard. It is very informative telling about the horrible things that happened here hundreds of years ago yet the guards/guides are so funny and entertaining as well. The crown jewels are there at the Tower. If you are interested in seeing the jewels with no crowds try to get there early and head to see them before taking a tour. Also go hungry because they have an amazing and delicious cafe for baked items as well as lunch. Highly recommend eating there.,Take a trip to the past
"September 8, 2016","Honestly, I know it's one of London's biggest attractions.. But for good reason, it's fantastic!Read up on some history, and the Tower of London is a who's who of London's heritage.A few tips- do get a tour from the beefeaters, makes it very entertaining, and they'll point out things you'd normally miss- try and catch the last tours to avoid heavy clouds.. The last beefeater yoman tour is at 3:30.. We went on the 3:15 tour and it was perfect.. After the tour was done, the crowds had thinned and you kind of felt you had most of the castle to yourself, and had time to see the other attractions.- bring a lite snack, find a park bench and make yourself a little picnic.. We did, and it was the perfect way to take a rest, enjoy the sights, and the beautiful grounds before catching some of the big highlights- do check out the crown jewels, and tour the inside of the white tower.. Both are worthwhile.Happy touring!    ",A must see in London
"September 6, 2016","Fascinating place. It was nice that they sold student tickets as a lot of the attractions don't do that. Well worth the money. There are tours by the beefeaters every half an hour. They deliver an interesting and informative tour of the tower and our tour was delivered by a Yeoman Warder called Spike I think. He was excellent and kept the tour light and funny. Your ticket includes a free tour by the beefeaters, entrance in to see the crown jewels and to other areas such as the white tower and the tower walls. It is a very interesting place, not too expensive for the tickets and a must see in London. One of the best tours in the city",Must for all visitors
"September 4, 2016","Join the hour tour, it was an excellent overview of the Tower history.  Guide made the tour interesting for all ages,  Jewels shouldn't be missed.  Wonderful way to get acquainted with London history.  Note: This is for able bodied visitors.  We were traveling with an older relative who had trouble with small stairs.  ",A few tips for enjoying one of the world's iconic places
"February 22, 2016","The Tower of London at £24.50 is one of the more expensive attractions in London and definitely one you would want to include if you've purchased a London Pass. With the pass you get avoid the lineups at the ticket wicket and go directly to the entrance. Also if you take Hop on Hop Off bus that's included in a one day London Pass you get a great view of the Tower of London as you drive across the Tower Bridge from Southwark.The other alternative is to buy your ticket online which will save a few pounds. Make sure to do it far enough in advance that it can be mailed to you, otherwise you'll waste time in line picking it up at the ticket office. The last alternative is to simply show up and buy a ticket at full price, but expect to queue up. Approaching the Tower of London from the Hop On Hop Off bus stop you get this great contrast between the new and the old with The Shard, the tallest building in Western Europe in view behind the Tower.I wish I could give some good advice on the best time of year or day to visit the Tower of London, but things have changed dramatically in the last few years with the explosion of Chinese tourists. While there are going to be a lot fewer visitors in the winter months, in all likelihood the tower will be inundated almost anytime you visit. Usually getting there at opening time (9:00  Tuesday-Saturday, 10:00 Sunday and Monday) is the best advice. Lot's of people suggest immediately rushing off to see the Crown jewels, but unless it's totally insane, that seems too much like a Disneyworld ploy.Once you are inside there are more choices to be made. You can a) just explore the place on your own - not recommended b) join a free guided tour led by a Yeoman Warder - that's a Beefeater to most of us or c) rent an audioguide for £4. The guided tours last one hour and are definitely not to be missed. The Yeoman or in at least one case Yeowoman, are funny, irreverent and informative. You'll definitely hear things you won't hear on the audiotour. However, there is one huge caveat - the number of people on the tour is not restricted so that sometimes the crowds are so big that it is next to impossible to hear the guide unless you are aggressively prepared to elbow your way to the front. My best advice is to go to the collection point for the next tour, which is right after you enter, and see how many people are waiting. If the number on the tour is twenty or less, go for it, but more than that will be problematic. The guided tour does not include the Crown jewels or the White Tower so you can do those after the tour. Even if you decide to skip the tour make darned sure you get that obligatory picture with a Yeoman.What's the big deal about the Tower of London anyway? Well think of William the Conqueror, Richard the Lion-Hearted, bad old King John, Henry III, the boy king who reigned for fifty-six years, Edward I (aka Longshanks, the Hammer of the Scots and anyone else who got in his way), Henry VII the winner of the War of the Roses and of course, perhaps most famous of all, Henry VIII. These were the winners, but lot of bad things went down here as well. Two kings, Henry VI and Edward V as well his little brother were murdered here. Anne Boleyn, Catharine Howard and Lady Jane Grey all lost their heads inside these walls. The list of famous prisoners is legion - numerous Scottish kings, William Wallace of Braveheart fame, three saints including Thomas More, Thomas Cranmer, Sir Walter Raleigh, Guy Fawkes, Samuel Pepys, William Penn, the future first prime minister Sir Robert Walpole and even Queen Elizabeth I. And it wasn't just a prison in olden times. In the 20th century Irish patriot Roger Casement was imprisoned after the Easter Rebellion, numerous WWII German spies were shot here and Rudolf Hess was brought here after defecting from Hitler in 1941. Among the last of the prisoners held in the Tower of London were the infamous criminals, the Kray twins, held not for being murderous thugs, but for dodging the draft.I mean if there was ever a place where the saying, ""If only these walls could speak"" was appropriate it would be here. And actually, in a sense the walls do speak through the graffiti that has been scratched into them by hundreds of unfortunate souls.The audio guide provides five distinct tours including the Norman era, the Medieval times and the tower as a place of punishment and execution. However, even before beginning the audio tour you are bound to notice that the outer walls of the Tower of London facing the Thames is maybe the best spot in the city to get a good shot of the Tower Bridge, arguably the most recognizable bridge in the world. The conquest of England by the Normans is arguably the most important turning point in British history. Never again would England undergo such a transformation, despite efforts by the Spanish, the French and the Germans over the centuries (although in the interests of accuracy the Dutch kind of did it through the back door in 1688). Prior to William's conquest England had been a regular doormat for the Celts, the Danes, the Saxons, the Norwegians, the Scots, the Angles, the Jutes and of course, the Romans. The English were the Toronto Maple Leafs of fighting forces. Anyone could beat them.William decided to change that and it started right here in the Tower of London with the construction of the White Tower, which I suspect most people confuse with actually being the Tower of London, when it's only one part, albeit the most recognizable one. Nobody had ever built such a huge fortress in England before and it became an immediate symbol of dominance and strength. Note in the photo attached the wooden stairs that go to a second story entrance. These could be removed if the place was attacked. The medieval portion of the audio our focuses on the reigns of Henry III and his son Edward I who between them ruled England for almost a century. The two preferred apartments in the outer portion of the tower to William's White Tower and today you can see a replica of Edward's throne from whence he dispensed justice and presided over the development of English Common Law.This is but a sample of the many things to be seen in the Tower of London including Henry VIII's suit of armour, the spot where two of Henry's wives were beheaded, the infamous rack used to torture prisoners and of course the Crown jewels. Don't even think of passing up the Tower of London on a visit to this great city.",Great history trip with young children!
"February 16, 2016",Visited for the 3rd time and this time with my young daughter. She absolutely enjoyed the experience especially the Young Explorers bit whereby they get a small booklet and they have to talk to the different characters around the Tower of London to answer several questions. Fun filled activity and at the end they earn a small prize. ,Got to see Dave
"February 16, 2016",Very nice place. You will see the queen's juwelry and henric the v th clothing....The nicest thing is too take Dave's tour. It is a real standup comedy show from one of the queen's officers. Real english humour.,Worth a visit
"February 1, 2016","This place is certainly worth a visit, especially for first timers to London. The crown jewels being the highlight. ",Beautiful!
"January 25, 2016","Loved this castle, great place to visit!  Honeymoon vacation to London and had to visit this castle.  Tour was great but hate that we couldn't take pictures inside some of the buildings.  Great outdoor space for taking pictures of the city.  Must visit if you're in London.",Take the Yeoman Warders Guided Tour!
"January 23, 2016","Must do when in London!!! It is great for people of all ages. I particularly loved seeing the Crown Jewels exhibit. When you go, make sure to take the Yeoman Warders tour. They are very knowledgeable and have a fascinating history. It is way better then just listening to an audio tour. As an FYI- they are not tour guides, they are highly trained and respected military members who have each served more then 20 years, so treat them accordingly.  ",London Pass Helps!
"January 10, 2016","The lines were not bad, but the London pass does help you bypass the crowd. Yeoman's tour is an excellent way to hit the highlights. In the Crown Jewels, if you want to linger, best to step out of line and let the crowd eddy past.",An interesting visit at a castle
"January 9, 2016","Whether you are interested in jewelry (crown's jewels), knights and Armour or the architecture of a castle building and the history behind it, the tower of London provides an interesting attraction whilst at London and does not disappoint. Arrive early to avoid the crowd and join the free walking tour for a great introduction into the tower of London. I was lucky to be able to have a humorous knowledgeable and engaging guide. Next up go to the busiest attraction the crown jewels before the crowds start to increase. Although the crown jewels didn't excite me as much as I thought it would, others may find the jewels very interesting.Check out the remaining areas of the castle in the order that interests you the most based on the introductory walking tour that you attended.",Crown jewels and the yeoman warders are great
"January 7, 2016","Steeped in history, a must-see place on any trip to London. The trip to the Tower of London is made even better by talking to the yeoman warders throughout the tower. They have great knowledge and background and very willing to share their history with the place, the history of the pieces, the buildings and so on.  If you join one of the bigger groups they take around, they're very witty as well",great place to visit
"January 5, 2016","Good and informative place to go to learn some things about the history of London.Didnt join the beef eater tour, and roamed around on our own. Informative plaques to tell the story.",One of my favorites!
"November 2, 2015","This is one of my favorite places to visit in London.  From the impressive view of the outside to all the buildings inside.  We bought our tickets online, to avoid waiting in line there.  It wasn't too busy in October, so seeing the crown jewels wasn't a wait.  ",THIS PLACE IS AMAZING
"October 28, 2015",I never went to the Tower of London on my first trip to London and so this time I made sure I didn't miss it and it was the first place to visit on arrival and it didn't disappoint. It was great. If there is one thing you need to do in London it's to visit the Tower of London.,Worth the time to see!
"October 26, 2015","We took the self guided tour with audio handsets. I think that the guided tour by one of the Beefeaters would have been better and more informative, but it was still so cool! It was alot larger than I expected and there were alot of stairs so I got a good workout. There are amazing views of the London Bridge from the towers.",Getting to be very crowded-but well worth the trip
"October 20, 2015","I had been to Tower of London 3 times and the best way to see it is on your own (not on a tour) so that you have a whole day to really experience it.  I took my 8 year old son and spent the better part of 5-6 hours there which allowed us to see all of the museum areas as well as listen to the Beefeaters tell their tales of the outside grounds.  We have gotten 2 very good Beefeaters who were very funny and they actually seemed to enjoy the tourists as much as we enjoyed them.  If you find that you can not hear the tour guide then maybe wait to get with another group to see if better. You can find them about every 15 minutes. The crown jewels are a must but the other museum have spectacular displays of weapons, armor and other artifacts that are so interesting to young boys and I rather enjoyed it too.  We also took this tour with one of the day long best of London tours that incorporated a lot of London in one day.  This allowed us to go into the Tower of London prior to actual opening to the public and we got to see the crown jewels right away with no wait.  The downside to this is that you only scratch the surface of all that the tower of London has to offer and you don't get to see much more than the crown jewels.  The Tower of London is a must see if you go to London but is best seen on your own time frame.",MUST DO IN LONDON!
"October 20, 2015","Tour to this place is excelent to learn about medieval bloody London. If your are going, you should do the tour guided by a Royal Guard (Befeatter), it is an experience you will never forget, they are all excelent Showmans. This time we did the tour with Dave Phillips and he was excellent.One free tour and this are the two things you should do if you only have one day in London, afterwards you can keep adding things.",Definitely should be on the list
"October 13, 2015",Definitely worth a visit for the history and the sights.  For us (family of 2 adults and 2 teenagers) the highlights were a) the guide who made it interesting and fun for both adults and the children b) the crown jewels and c) the walk on the walls for great views and photos of Tower Bridge.,Go early to the Tower and avoid the queues
"October 7, 2015",All I expected and more - so clean.  Best time to go is early so we didn't have to queue anywhere. Don't need audio guides as map and information extremely helpful.,So many layers of history all in one place.
"October 6, 2015","Plan to give this amazing place a full day. There is so much to take in and enjoy. The school groups had the right idea, bring lunch (or plan to eat in the nice cafe), rest up on a bench and keep going. There is something for everyone, from the beautiful jewels presented along with their symbolism, to the grim and grisly stories associated with the prison. We were able to take our time, wait a few if there were groups, and study everything in as much or little depth as we wished.",Heads will Roll  - but there's more
"October 2, 2015",Beyond the morbidly fascinating history that everyone knows  - the beheading ordered by Henry VIII of his wives #2 Anne Boleyn and and #4 Catherine Howard - there are so many other important historical events that happened on this site. It helps to read up      so you have some understanding of how and why this magnificent set of buildings (including a chapel) have morphed over the centuries. (check wikipedia - so easy and fast) If you don't like history or don't see it's application then better to visit Harrods.,Give yourself plenty of time
"October 1, 2015",The Tower of London was really great and I only wish we allocated more time for it. We did an audio tour which was worth it but took quite a bit of time. I would say half a day or so would allow you to see everything. The Royal Jewels exhibit was entertaining and I'm really glad none of them were in use during our trip. Same with the torture devices ha! ,Well worth a visit............
"February 19, 2020","We spent a great morning here - starting off doing the Beefeater tour - a must do!! Andy (our Beefeater) was full of knowledge but also made it all good fun.  There is so much to see - the Crown Jewels were amazing.  It was a cold February Monday morning so we didn't have to queue for anything but I would imagine in the summer there will be quite a bit of queuing.   The Tower of London is so steeped in history, some quite gruesome and it really is worth a visit.",Beefeater Tour with Lawrence
"February 19, 2020","The Tower of London tour was incredible! Our tour guide ‘Beefeater- Lawrence’ was exceptional! We learned so much about the history of the Tower & the Kings & Queens & all the be-headings! Lawrence was so knowledgable, but more importantly he made us laugh!",Step back in history
"February 19, 2020","A guided tour with a Beefeater is a must, the information you will be given is much better than that found in guidebooks. Ensure you have enough time to see everything. ",Nice but expensive
"February 19, 2020","This is good place to visit with so many things to see from past but again this is expensive, ~30 Pounds per person. I would suggest you take the London Pass and then visit it.Do cover Tower Bridge with it, well you can't skip that if you are going for tower of London.",History Galore
"February 19, 2020","If you love history it’s a great place. Was there for a family trip enjoyed our selfs. Wandered around for a couple of hours. The signage was a little different but no issues. Did not use a tour had fun roaming on our own, but had engaging interactive experiences through out. ",Delving into our history 
"February 19, 2020",Fantastic place enriched with so much history and once behind the walls you forget your in central london at times as it's like a world within itself.  I have been numerous times and still very much enjoy my visits and I have also been fortunate enough to do the ceremony of the keys and have a few drinks in the Beefeaters Pub.  Watching the ceremony I felt like I had gone back in time and got shivers in a good way totally immersive 😍😁.  Definitely worth the visit and even walking around outside afterwards is also very gratifying and seeing gower bridge.  I recommend getting a Thames river boat afterwards so lovely 😁❤,A good piece of history
"February 18, 2020","My visit to the Tower of London was both educational and fascinating. It was well organized with something to learn at every  turn, I would advice one gets the audio guide for abit more information and definitely take the Yeoman warden tour which gives a baseline to where to go next. Of course, the crown jewels was a slight to behold and the many towers had something learn. It is a testament to man's ingenuity and engineering feat architectural speaking. One must not forget the piece of history one would learn along the way.",Tower of London experience
"February 18, 2020","We were thoroughly entertained by our Beefeater Shady (aka. Andy). He had a great grasp of the history of this most magnificent ""castle"" (but never used as such!). The Crown Jewels are breathtaking, to say the least. I highly recommend this tour as a starter for first-time visitors. It doesn't take long, and is full of history for those who are so-inclined. Its proximity to the Tube is great (Tower Hill station on the Circle line).",Good experience
"February 18, 2020",We arrived early morning and there were no queues. We had the audio guide which was good and very informative well worth £5.  There is so much to see at we were there about 3 hours. ,So much history in the center of London!
"February 18, 2020","We went first thing in the morning on a busy late July day and we were able to get in to see the crown jewels with no wait at all. This was quite an amazing exhibit to see. We then perused the grounds and grabbed a cup of coffee at the cafe. We then headed out to see a Beefeater tour. While I though our guide was funny, the stories they tell are quite gory and graphic, so much so, we skipped out after the initial speech. This tour is not for the weak-stomached or sensitive-minded. This was disappointing to me because I had heard so much about this tour. We diverted to take a self-guided tour of the White Tower and this was actually an amazing experience I almost skipped. I would say the White Tower is a must see. We only had a few hours here, but there's enough to fill a whole day here.",Definitely worth seeing! Pre buy your tickets online!!!
"August 14, 2015","Definitely pre-purchase tickets online!!!! Huge time saver! We arrived there right when they opened, walked right in, you could see the cattle line barriers set up for waiting periods (outside and inside). There's a sign that indicated the estimated wait time from certain points in the line. Don't miss the Beefeater Tour (every hour). Informative!",Get there early!!!
"August 13, 2015","Get there before it opens to get in line - and once it opens, go directly to the crown jewels, otherwise you could wait 2 hours to see them!  Also make sure to take advantage of the tour (in good weather) or presentation (in bad weather) - that was the best part for us.",Enjoyable day out
"August 13, 2015","I took my god daughter to the Tower of London, she is 11 years old and she loved it and it took me back to my childhood, as she was not born in the uk she was fascinated by it all and loved the history behind it, loved the bloody tower and of course the seeing the Crown Jewels, the whole afternoon was enjoyable and no queuing to get in, only £32 for both of us. I think it was value for money.",They have a family headset for family with 11 year olds and under
"August 12, 2015","We rented ""family"" tour headset which was not widely advertised.  They have a different setting on the same headset that turns it into kids friendly tour.  I have 12 year old and 8 year old.  I did adult tour in the past, but even for me, I liked the kids version better.  We were there in the middle of August and got there around 11am.  Crown Jewel line was so long that we gave up going there.  (We recently went to Rosenberg Castle in Copenhagen and saw Danish Crown Jewel there with no line so we did not line up and wait that long to see something similar).  Armors in White Castle was worth seeing.  My 8 year old hates museums, but he actually enjoyed all the history and the tour.  Highly recommend it!","Packed With History, The Tower of London Really Satisfies"
"August 6, 2015",Liked:  The Beefeaters-led tour.  A tour of the upper floor of the tower.  The Crown Jewels.  The armor (especially Henry VIII's).  Traitor's Gate.  The Royal Mint.Did not like:  The memorial to the people who were executed on-site.  Our meal in the restaurant to the east of the White Tower.,Everyone Knows My Name
"August 6, 2015","This truly is one of the most famous buildings in the world; who hasn't heard its powerful name. Built by our ‘conqueror’ William (who had a rightful claim to the throne of England so could hardly be a 'conqueror'), it was built as one  White Tower in 1066 William stamped his authority on England by building numerous castles; it is perfectly placed on the River Thames and acted as both gateway and fortress to the capital city of London. From here, if you don’t spend all day marvelling at the White Tower and its numerous extensions over the years,the visitor is perfectly poised to visit Tower Bridge, the South Bank and other great London  attractions. The Tower of London claims to be the most complete example of an 11th century fortress palace remaining in EuropeThe list of people imprisoned here is impressive and includes, and you could get to the Tower by 4 main routes•	attempted assassination of the monarch•	assisting foreign enemies •	speaking against the monarch •	or, considered serious at the time, counterfeiting coinsThe partial list is a who’s who of key historical figuresBishop Ranulf Flambard – (the first prisoner 1232)King Baliol of Scotland (1296)William Wallace (1305)King Henry VI 1465The Two Princes - Edward V and his brother Richard, Duke of York (1483)Sir Thomas More (1535)Thomas Cromwell (1540)Guy Fawkes  (1606)Sir Walter Raleigh William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury (1645)1780, prisoner, Henry Laurens (the only American – 1780)Rudolf HessThe Kray Twins 1952If tha is not enough then there is always the Crown Jewels – or especially interesting but little known to tourist The Ceremony of The Keys, a ritual carried out nightly for at least 700 years","Moving walkways, did they use those for beheading?"
"August 5, 2015",The Tower of London has taken on a bit of a Disney-eque style.  The displays are obviously set for tourists and the moving walkway at the Crown Jewels was the giveaway that this is just another tourist stop.,Worth the visit
"July 25, 2015","Very interesting venue. Best if you arrive early and head straight to the Crown Jewels. By noon the queue to see the jewels appears insufferably long, as you have to wait in the hot sun.  They had a great idea at the jewels themselves: a moving sidewalk to keep the flow moving. Interesting knights armor and weapons. Suggest 2-3 hours there. And don't miss the minor attraction just outside the tower; the All Hallows' church. The tower bridge was a gimmick, but the Thames River cruise just outside the tower was convenient. One more thing: the railroad has a 2 for 1 deal into the tower if you take the train into town, or just buy 2 train tickets for 5 pounds total . It will save you the cost of one admission into the tower.",Get there at 9am or be prepared for crowds.
"July 21, 2015","It's a great attraction, and you could spend all day there, but the crowds get overwhelming, so get there when it opens.while visiting last July, I asked the Yeoman when is the best time to get here? His reply was ""December"".  Otherwise he said, get here when it opens at 9.",Step back in time and finish up in Bling City
"July 19, 2015",Join a Beefeater Tour - every 30 minutes. They give you some very interesting facts - god only knows how they remember every beheading... We left the tour after and hour and went on our own little walk about before joining the 25 minute queue for the Crown Jewels - this was very quiet compare to other days. Felt like a magpie in the Crown Jewels. You walk into a vault - 3 feet deep safe door. There are diamonds and gems the size of grapes and plums. De Beers can't even value the priceless collection some of which dates back to the 1600's. You could easily spend the day walking around. Cost of attraction was £24.50 at the site but you can probably get it cheaper on some discount websites. ,Costly Boring ripoff !
"July 17, 2015","Went on a Sunday. Way to busy, too much walking, torture chamber is farcical ! Don't get me wrong the main tower is full of great armor & so on but to me it just showed what shear wealth Kings & Queens lived in comparison to their people of the time.The queue for the Crown jewels was at least an hr & half long so didn't bother.In summary £35 for 1 adult & 1 child to wonder round an overrated attraction , forget it.If you are really into the Towers history buy a book !",Fascinating & Engaging
"July 15, 2015","Going to the Tower of London was a great experience. Though lots of people go there just to witness the crown jewels, there is a whole lot more to see and learn about than just that. There are tours that are complimentary with the entrance ticket, which were really great. Though the tour was fascinating, we ended up breaking off the group because of the many, many people going on the tour who made it hard to hear the otherwise loud man's voice. The crown jewels were absolutely intriguing, with a certain mystery to them. It was a really pity that they didn't allow photographs, because I bet a lot of people - like me - would have loved to share these photos with there friends and share their experiences. There are also many interesting buildings inside the province to explore. If you plan on going, you also have to plan on spending your whole day. That should be fine, though, because of the many cafés. You must go!",Dont miss this!
"July 15, 2015","I thought it was a tower...it was a whole city.   Took all day t see it all   It was fantastic--what history!   Don't go to London without seeing this.   Be prepared for a lot of steps.   And don't miss the Yeoman tour, it is awesome!",Beautiful 
"July 14, 2015","What an amazing historical place! So much to take in! The beautiful buildings and Crown Jewels make this worth visiting. It is very busy so you need to be prepared to queue for the Crown Jewels, but it is worth the wait!!!! It is easy to spend 4 hours here.",One big queue
"July 13, 2015",The queue to see the crown jewells was massive - waiting times of at least an hour and a half judging by the speed it was moving and the main tower was also very busy.  Poor value for money as we couldn't return again on the same ticket to see the crown jewells at a quieter time.,See the Crown Jewels and have a tour
"July 13, 2015",Very interesting group tour is included with admission. Very funny and lots of history.  Quick line to see the Crown Jewels. ,Don't do it if you are short on time
"July 12, 2015",I was really excited after seeing a documentary on the tower but it was pretty disappointed. We paid for no line tickets and there was no line. The only cool thing was the crown jewels room. Don't think its worth the money,A great afternoon with kids
"July 11, 2015",This was one of the best days - our son loved the whole experience and we did too. Lots and lots of stairs in all directions do be prepared for that. The site does not have lifts that we could see. ,Tower Of London
"July 11, 2015",Its another classic building of London. Must visit if you are going for 1st time. For all types of crowd. No Entry fee.,On a crowded summers day we visited the Crown Jewels
"July 8, 2015","The Tower of London is one of the United Kingdoms World Heritage Sites.  Renowned for it Beefeaters, the keepers of the Tower, its ravens, and its association with the execution of notable and less notable persons; it is today the repository of the Crown Jewels.  Sponsored by diamond merchants De Beers, there is a magnificent multimedia presentation that precedes an exhibition of the swords, orbs, scepters and crowns that are the symbols of office of the British monarchy.  Less well known is its role as the warehouse of the royal armory, and while paintings of Henry the Eighth depict him as a large man, his suit of armor confirms both his size and majesty.  The tours conducted by the Beefeaters are fascinating and entertaining, as for many the Tower of London remains their place of residence and worship.Visitors to London should not miss the opportunity to visit this World Heritage Site.",Great for everyone
"May 30, 2015","So much more than the ""tower"" itself, this expansive collection of buildings and exhibits covers the Crown Jewels, Knights in Armour and much, much more.  Enjoy a ""Beefeater"" tour if you can, we found it too crowded to be very enjoyable, but the rest of the visit was well worthwile.",Inaccessible in a wheelchair
"May 30, 2015","Obviously this is a very old site and you wouldn't expect ramps everywhere, however the whole site is cobbled from the entrance gate in and the 'access routes' are narrow, uneven and cluttered with benches and bins. Unless your wheelchair is good at negotiating cobbles - most get stuck and nearly tip over - do not visit unless you can get out and walk. Jewel House good once we finally got there, getting back to the exit was really hard though.",Don't miss even if you have a few days.
"May 30, 2015",Really beautiful and historic brickwork layout well preserved and you can see where the moat was etc. Well kept you can get around easy but if you are seeing the Crown Jewels would suggest you arrive early before there is too much of a line.,get thee to the tower
"May 30, 2015","This is not a cheap tourist attraction (almost £50 for 2 people) but I would say it is worth a visit.Get there early and go and see the crown jewels before the queue builds up (some people have queued for well over 1 hour) they are well worth a visit- but not sure about a long wait.The armouries is good, henry the eighth and other well known monarchs armour on display.The bloody tour and the tower torture are lacking, the torture tower has 3 items on display and some people had to queue to see these (not really worth the time).The Anne Boyelyn reinactment is good to watch- very entertaining and the characters are mingling with the crowds before and after performances for photos.I would recommend getting an audio guide (£4) this made the visit more enjoyable/informative.",The Say was Sunny
"May 29, 2015",Best way to take pictures of this building is in the sun. Easy to get to with the Tube Tower Hill Station is the best stop. You walk out and look across the street and there is is. Grand and Majestic waiting for you to visit.,A must see
"May 29, 2015","Loved it. A must see. Dont miss the crown jewels, very interesting. Best to buy the tickets ahead of time, but we did not experience a line at all. It was quite easy to get in.",You can feel the history!
"May 24, 2015","Even though we visited on a slightly misty, rainy day, you could feel the presence of history here.  It is amazing what was built on this site so many years ago.  How difficult life must have been for those that worked here or were imprisoned here. There is much to see and soak up as you learn more about the Tower of London.  Don't wait until late is the day to arrive, get here early so you can spend the day!  Plenty of activities to keep you busy.",Must See
"May 24, 2015","If you are a history buff, or just interested in medieval or English history, this place is a must see.  Loved the Henry VIII armor and Bloody Tower.  But, the best part is the Crown Jewels, they are breath taking...  Also, try to follow a tour guide as they will enhance your visit and explain what's what.",A great history 
"May 22, 2015","When you get inside, take the beefeater tour around the castle, you get a lot of information. Then take a walk to the vault and see the Crown jewels, and then walk around the castle to see all the small corners. There is so much information given to you in an easy manner that you easily can spend half a day there without getting tired. ",rubbish
"May 17, 2015",awful they don't give you a map and no tour so your left to wonder and to cramped and busy not good for kids either ,Beautiful Tower of London !
"March 25, 2015","We decided to go to visit the Tower of London with 2 friends . Visit was pretty good because we had a guide, Billy , with excellent skills in history and he knew what he was talking about . He made the visit going so fast and interesting thanks to his charisma and humour with his special touch . Tower is very nice and chapel is so beautiful . I recommend to get the free guide for it to make the visit better . It is must see in London . X ",Get there early to avoid the crowds
"March 21, 2015","Fabulous architecture, great history, good workout, great Yeoman storytelling, really getting there by boat, and the most fabulous jewelry collection in the world. Get your tickets in advance !",Wow!!!
"March 21, 2015","Aside from being one of a kind structure in England, I'm really amazed of its historical background...Really amazing!!!",not cheap but very nice
"March 20, 2015",The audio guide was very helpfull as english is not our first language. It was very interesting and instructive to understand part of the history oficial the United Kingdom. Luckily we saw groups of children with their teachers visiting tais important landmark. Do not miss it!,Worthy of admission price
"March 13, 2015","The guided tour - included in admission - is good.  After you do that, there are several good historical displays throughout the castle which you can self-guide on.  Spent almost two hours here.  Tip: go up on the wall in the SW corner, and go all the way around from there.  ","Must see for castle, history and artifacts fans"
"March 10, 2015","Tower of London is a historical complex which houses, among others, the British crown jewels, the over 1000 years old White Tower and the place of execution of Anne Boleyn and a few other historical personas. It's a place filled with hundreds, if not thousands, of stories so rich, that you can just feel them in the air. There are a few tips that would have helped us plan our trip, had we known them, so I listed them below, so that you can learn from our experience and plan your visit more effectively.TIP 1: Buying ticketsTickets are quite expensive, as they cost around 25 pounds. There is a voluntary donation of around 2.5 pound included in the price, so if you wouldn't like to donate, you need to ask the cashier to deduct it from your price.TIP 2: Selecting your guideIf you'd like to use a guide book, you can buy it for 5 pounds at the till. If you prefer audio guide, you can rent it inside of the Tower, also for around 5 pounds. There are also some guided tours and performances - you will find the list and the starting times on the leaflet that you will receive with your tickets. We took part in two of them and they were very interesting, especially the tour with the beefeater, who had a gift to engage the crowd and tell stories from the many years that passed within those ancient walls. At the end of the tour, he also explained that beefeaters are not quite usual tour guides and that to become one you need to go through quite a hassle - make sure you stay till the end to hear this story.TIP 3: Planning your stayWe thought that one hour will be just enough to walk around the complex - how much time can you spend in an old tower? Well, it took us three hours and we could have stayed longer. All the tours and stories were just so interesting, that with each and every one, we just wanted more, so depending on your interests, make sure you secure enough time.Tower of London was one of the highlights of our stay in London it was definitely time well spent.",Wonderful in every way! The highlight of my trip!
"March 5, 2015","Take the time to explore this magnificent museum. Guides were fantastic and informative and so friendly to Americans. Crown Jewels, knights and artifacts were elegantly and effectively showcased. A must do in London!",awesome way to spend a day
"March 4, 2015","While on a ""hop-on-hop-off"" tour of London, it was mentioned that ""anyone who speaks the English language...owes some part of their history to this castle""....  to be there and to walk in the same area as so many famous (and infamous) people was an awesome experience!  We did not go on the guided tour given by the Yeoman....but we passed them several times and they, as well as the tourists they were talking to, seemed to be having a really fun time!  We sat on a bench with one of the ravens and we did most of the sites that are there to be seen.  While we could have easily stayed the day, we decided to save this visit for our last day in London so we only had a couple of hours.  While I do feel like we ""got it all done"" it would have been nice to stay and linger over some of the exhibits.  Having gone on February 15, right at opening time...I feel it was not as crowded as it usually is.  In fact, upon leaving...the line to get in was three times longer than when we first entered...so keep that in mind.  I believe the crowds can be large in the Spring/Summer....requiring a lot more time to cover as much ground as we did in the Winter....  There are clean bathroom facilities inside the castle, however I did not notice any place that offered food.   The crown jewels are great but my favourite part was just to be on the ""green"" with the Ravens and just looking at the castle itself.",Wonderful historic site!
"March 3, 2015","The tower of London is a must see. The Beefeaters are right off the liquor bottle! They are very friendly and helpful. Then there are the crown jewels, absolutely marvelous, a true collection of royal jewels from Queen Victoria's tiny crown to the jeweled scepters. What a display. After that you can see the actual block where Ann Bolynne got her head chopped off along with other torture devices. Just too many to mention. If you are in London, you must not overlook visiting the Tower of London!","Born Londoner, but still a must visit attraction"
"February 18, 2015","I have passed The Tower hundreds of times in my lifetime, but I went inside the walls for the first time last November when guiding a friend around London. The poppy installation was outstanding and very thought provoking. From my point of view The Tower was the highlight of the all the places we visited over 4 days. I will go again at some point this year, and will take my time and spend the whole day there, and if there is a guided tour available I will pay the extra. May I suggest getting a boat from Westminster Pier to the Tower, spend a worthwhile time there and then take a No: 15 bus back to Trafalgar Square.","A Must See, but Tricky"
"May 16, 2015","The Tower is a must see, but it is not an easy visit.  Buy your tickets in advance and skip the long, slow ticket lines.  Go EARLY to see the Crown Jewels; if you don't go early it chews up the entire visit.  After the Jewels, seeing the rest of the Tower takes at least two hours.  The audio tour is average, so combine your audio with lectures from the uniformed ""Beefeaters"" for more information. It always helps to read up using a guide book in advance.Right behind the ticket booth (outside the Tower) there are a few sandwich shops that are packed and dirty.  Walk past these one more block parallel to the Thames and you'll see several more that are clean and not jammed.",Worthwhile tourist trap
"May 14, 2015","I had been to the Tower of London back in 1987. The only significant change is the addition of actors giving period performances. Kids will probably really enjoy the performances. There is an enormous amount of history here.  Exhibits are interesting and well laid out. It will take a half a day to get through everything. History buffs will love this stuff. Casual tourists might burn to after a couple of hours.  I took a year of British history in college and had some background and understanding as to the importance of this place, and the people and artifacts displayed. My wife has little interest in the difference between sixteenth century armor and seventeenth century armor.  Two hours here was enough for her.",What have they done??
"May 9, 2015","Very expensive to get in.  We went to the Tower of London about 5-6 years ago and thought it was terrific.  We took our nieces this time as they were keen to see it.  Very disappointing.  Instead of being able to see what it was like walls had been plastered over, rooms were full of information boards and television screens.  Gift shops, gift shops, too many gift shops.Included in the admission was a ""voluntary"" donation.  If you did not want to pay the donation you had to actually state so.Would not be taking anyone else there.",Go Early; Explore it all
"May 9, 2015","What can I say that a million people haven't said about The Tower of London? It's amazing. It's incredible. And it embodies and immortalizes centuries of utterly fascinating British history.Get a tour from one of the Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters) and consider if that's all you have time for, or if you want to go in-depth enough to take advantage of the audio tour that also is offered. The audio tour is good (and it has optional ""extras"" in addition to the straight tour). Through it, you'll get a thorough introduction to areas that the warders don't visit, so it's not a bad idea to do both.Tips:* Buy tickets in advance* Get there early in the morning* Head to the Crown Jewels Exhibit first* Then take the Yeoman Warder tour* After that, if you have time, pick up the audio tour device and explore the interiors of buildings, the open spaces, etc.* Consider visiting The White Tower (the central building) next, and then the side buildings afterwards* NOTE: The audio tour does give info on The Crown Jewels, so if you think you will be getting it the device, pick it up when you get there.",History +++
"May 4, 2015",Great place to visit for history my 3rd visit there and still haven't managed to see everything . I went with a elderly father and there are a lot of steps for a elderly person to manage but you can do it slowly ,Good place to learn about some of British history
"May 2, 2015","Really good place, if you wish to learn a bit more about British history firsthand. Authentic furniture, cold ancient walls, and great stories brings this place on the top of London attractions.",Not been in a Long While !!!
"May 2, 2015",Just amazing History of my Country !!!! And got a Boat back to Westminster from Tower Pier.........which was an awesome experience in it's self !!!,STAMPS
"May 2, 2015","Whilst we had an enjoyable visit to ""The Tower"" we just wanted to make others aware of the stamps.  We purchased a book of Tower stamps to send postcards to relatives/friends in the UK.  Having asked if the stamps were okay to use and were told yes, we were really disappointed to find out that when received by the receipients, a charge was made.  Apparently the stamps are not for UK use.  When we contacted the Tower about this, whilst very polite and pleasant, we were told to take it up with the Post Office. Just a word of caution, the stamps aren't cheap (£1.00 each) plus the postcard plus the surcharge incurred by recipients make the pleasure of sending postcards a very expensive activity.",A must see for the London visitor
"April 30, 2015","Great tours, plenty of room to explore--this is one of the best Historic Palaces of London.  Get there early before the crowds and tours arrive for the best experience.",Don't miss this tour
"April 30, 2015","The tickets provide a yeoman warder - a knowledgable guide w more than 22 yrs of service in the military - he provided an extensive tour - with fantastic info - it lasted 45 min which was perfect to then visited the Crown Jewels ( on the property / the knights and armory museums - the other parts to this "" village"" - don't leave London without this visit! ",Great day out
"February 16, 2020",Fascinating insight into the gruesome & brutal history of theroyals and royal visitors at the Tower. The weather was appalling sadly and much of the tour was outside so we got soaked but the day was still very worthwhile. The Yeomen / Beefeater tour guides were very entertaining whilst at the same time delivering detailed accounts of history. Recommended! ,Absolutely amazing 
"February 16, 2020",If you love history The tower is a must.  We opted to wait for the guided Yeoman tour which was amazing. Our guide was very informative and hilarious. Unfortunately I don’t remember his name but he was brilliant. It is so impressive. The Crown Jewels exhibit is a highlight along with the white tower. You do need about 3 hours to see everything There is so much to see and it has a lovely cafe you can stop at for lunch or a snack. The food is good quality and reasonably priced. One of the highlights of our London trip ,Great Experience
"February 16, 2020",Really enjoyed this visit it was amazing and I learnt so much. Cannot believe you can get so close to the crown jewels.  Interactive session at the end if the white tower section was the kids highlight.,Good day 
"February 16, 2020",Good day out. We were there nearly 3 hours. Plenty to look at. It was raining when we went. Staff friendly. Though I am English and go to London a lot this is the first time we had been. Would be great for kids,Family visit
"February 16, 2020",Went here when they had the Prisoner escape re-enactment which the grandchildren loved and still talk about what they learnt from it. We booked our tickets in advance and ended up spending the whole day there as there was so much to see.,Fun day out
"February 15, 2020",My family had a nice time visiting the tower. It is a little difficult to navigate with a stroller so my husband and I took turns checking out areas which were not stroller friendly.,"Wonderful trip, Tower of London bought to life by Yeoman Warder"
"February 15, 2020","We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to The Tower of London today.   It was amazing to see the Crown Jewels up close.  There is so much to see and do.  Our highlight was the great tour by John, the Yeoman Warder.  He was very knowledgeable, telling us fascinating stories about the history of the Tower.  Highly recommend.",Busiest day of the year at the Tower of London!
"February 15, 2020","We booked our visit for Sat Dec 28th as we had only 5 days in London — turns out it was the busiest day of the year, with 20,000+ visitors!  Booking the tickets online saves money but it does lock you in to a specific date and time. No issue for us. Our beefeater guide—Yeoman Warder Steve—knowledgeably delivered history with wit and style, but our tour group was enormous, which at times made it difficult to hear him. We explored the buildings and enjoyed the various guides and displays (White Tower, Bloody Tower, prison, torture chamber) but found the narrow, winding circular stairways a challenge for 2-way traffic.The queue to see the a Crown Jewels was over 2 hours long, so we gave it a miss.  We easily spent 4 hours at the site, and could have lingered longer. Tower Bridge is adjacent—we walked across it numerous times but did not pay to tour it—and there are some spectacular views for photographers.It is worth doing some research in advance so you can strategize what you want to see if you are a history buff and you don’t have a full day. Highly recommended!",Worth a visit with a London pass
"February 15, 2020",We had a London pass and this was included it was worth a visit. Enjoyed the dragon the most. Don’t like to think of the money wasted on the Crown Jewels over the years when some people don’t have even a roof over their heads however very informative place and nice to see.,A full day of living in by gone days
"February 15, 2020","Firstly before you look at anything join one of the guided tours. Informative, humorous and scary at times it’s something every visitor has to do. The Beefeaters who lead the tours are all exceptional, very knowledgable and really friendly - but don’t mess with them!!!Lots of things to do - I think you need at least half a day, if not more, to visit it all. The best part is obviously the Crown Jewels themselves but that’s simply one part. There are lots of steps though- not too sure how well an elderly or less abled person may cope. If you can manage steps though do visit. Another wonderful attraction right in the heart of London",Wonderful Historical Building
"September 5, 2014","We had an amazing day at the Tower of London and you could of spent all day there.  It is worthwhile paying for audio for a self guided tour.  The queues were long for the Crown Jewels but moved quickly and well worth the wait.  The poppy exhibition was beautiful and represents British soldiers lost in WW1 (888,246 ceramic poppies will progressively fill the Tower's moat).",Don't lose your head or patience
"September 4, 2014","Fabulous day spent at The Tower despite the crowds. Best advice I can give is to wait for the free tour with a Beefeater. (they are every half hour in summer during peak time, maybe not so frequent at other times) Our guide was Crawford, he was fun, informative and made the history of the Tower interesting. Also worth the wait to see the crown jewels.",An essential if you're visiting London
"September 3, 2014","Of all the places we've visited in London this summer, the Tower of London is one of the places that we enjoyed the most. This monumental historic place is loaded with history, and there is something truly impressive about walking in these settings. The audioguide is highly recommended, as it greatly enhances your visit and lets you know more about the history of this place. My advice is that you get there as close to the opening as possible (10 in the morning) and get in line for the Jewels of the Crown exposition right away, because the queue can get awfully long ! That way, you'll be able to take a walk through the rest of the Tower afterwards and won't lose any time.",The Tower of London Remembers Exhibit Not To Be Missed!
"September 3, 2014","I am not even British and I cried when I saw this once in a lifetime, amazing installation! The immensity of this work of art and the red poppies spilling out from the wall is a sight to be seen. It is a somber reminder of the blood let by the thousands who gave their lives.....thanks to all the volunteers who ""plant"" the 880,000 ceramic red poppies daily!",Real slice of history
"September 3, 2014","The Tower of London is about as iconic a site as you can find in London if you are a history buff.  It seems the very walls breathe British history.  We walked in just in time to see the Beefeaters march past, which was cool. Loved walking through the various towers and seeing how things must  have looked centuries ago.Lots of people there, but that is to be expected. The views of the Tower Bridge looming over the old fortress were fabulous. It is a bit pricey, but it seems like just about everything is pricey in London these days.",Tower of London
"September 2, 2014","My limited knowledge of history said ""executions at the Tower of London"". Boy was I lacking in knowledge. The Tower of London is a vast walled property like an estate. There are definitely execution areas including an archway from the Thames into the prison area but there is so much more. Also many steps and circular stairways to maneuver. ",Tower not Terrible..not Tremendous either
"September 1, 2014","Ok in a nutshell: I totally wanted to be drawn into the long history of the Tower itself here. What I didn't know and got was something more compartmentalized as to broad bits of history of England. Now that's not all bad; but in the way it presents I kind of felt as if it was a tourist destination akin to Epcot center with more unrelated history particles grouped together without any rides. The Tower of London complex is roughly 13 acres with multiple buildings and exhibits throughout. It has the remains of the tower and genuine other period buildings set amongst some grassy park-scapes with the river to one side. It sits slightly lower from certain street levels and entrances and you can occasionally get a glimpse of the modern buildings and London skyline construction as backdrops from within the site. Although they have done a very good job of limiting that issue, you do really do feel you are back in a gothic built castle and time period.Yes, the Crown Jewels are there and that should be your first stop as there always seems to be a Q. We wanted to see them first; so we lined up right about noon and it took us about 25 minutes to get in. Once in; you go through second and third line-management distractions with some video shows and historical tidbits up until you actually get to the jewels. Absolutely gorgeous and amazing! But what doesn't do justice is the people mover conveyer belts that go past them. One can understand the need to move people along, security, the safety of the jewels.... But gliding; albeit slowly past the jewels on belts makes you feel quite mechanical and processed in the matter. Especially after waiting up to 50 plus minutes to get to see them.But then you always get to say, as we wanted, ""I saw the Crown Jewels"".There are other displays and exhibits set up through out the compound, all dealing with either historical aspects of the Tower center itself, or England's growth and expansion. We found the English small coin ""minting "" exhibit and museum  quite nice although almost hidden in a tiny building once into the main entrance.There are a lot of steps up and down and the majority of the compound is very and I mean very rough bricked cobbles and often uneven surfaces. It is also on a hill, so those with bad knees and walking issues you will have quite a rough go of it. They do have accessibility guides and wheel chair rentals. But with the exception of the main ""square "" and access to the Crown Jewels most of the rest of the complex, Exhibits, and entry points are extremely difficult to navigate and access at all. If it's not narrow steep staircases (towers as you would expect) it's tiny doorways, stairs and wood stair cases everywhere, and cobblestones with gaps, that would jar anyone in a push chair or wheelchair right out if it.  Both wheelchairs and strollers bounce terribly. Do be careful!Visitor facilities are abundant, benches in the outdoor complex more like the ""square"" amongst the main buildings were plentiful; and peaceful, grassy, tree-d areas always a step or few away for a nice park feel. You can watch the Tower ravens picking through the grass. The occasional cart for ice cream or treats could always be found on the next turn (tres ""Disney-esq"" again) although with Beefeaters ( do take a tour with them) and proper English actors entertaining the visitors you knew you were in London no questions.Lastly, the moat or what was the moat is currently splayed with hundreds of ceramic red roses which look amazing. A tribute to all the servicemen in the UK, it is quite stunning and blankets a large area of the moat region on all sides of the outer wall of the complex. Looking down from the streets above it looks like fields and fields of real red flowers, almost a ""wizard of oz"" or Monet poppy field visage, and is quite impressive. Think that is there till Nov of 2014Overall this seems a fair place to visit (I'd make it 1/2day or less as the kids will get restless) and the Crown Jewels are the stellar attraction. The complex is also right on the riverside with City Cruises right next to it, so if you do the Big Bus tour or similar you usually get a Free cruise with them, and it's an added perk to walk through the gift shop upon leaving the Tower complex and hop on a free cruise back to center if town and Westminster pier.I appreciate the history of the Tower but found it and the compound more broken up than I expected as far as a linear history lesson, with too much of too many little things covered. So for that fact plus the big inaccessibility issues I could only give it a fair rating.","Disappointed,nothing great about this - Skip"
"August 26, 2014","This is my first review on TA. I have to admit I visited this purely based on TA reviews and ratings. I left the tower feeling I have missed something / seriously disappointed. There is no guidance from staff or anyone there. It was raining and was told there is no guided tour because of rain. The place is big with several towers. There are long queues everywhere and the amount of time you spend on queue to enter a tower is more than the time you spend inside it. I spent 40 mins in queue for ""Torture tower"" and its basically one small room with 2 weapons - 5 mins inside. The ""crown jewels"" is over hyped and prepare for 1 hour queue on outside - and when you enter - its exhibits of jewels and crowns - there is nothing jaw dropping - you can pretty much imagine how these would look like - its OK on the whole. The next tower is ""white tower"" which is basically exhibits of armors, weapons etc. There are couple of cool things like faces of kings, a dragon and a lion - but that's about it. There is not much of an ""experience"" more of seeing exhibits.I did not have beefeaters tour - Infact I was lost as there is no guidance on what to do and what is provided as part of attraction. I spent on whole about 4 hours (door to door) and 25 pounds on just this attraction and left feeling disappointed and that missing feeling. There could be more in there, but there is not much guidance to explore it the best possible way.Bottomline - Avoid it to save your time and money.",Poppies
"August 25, 2014",Went to see the remembrance poppies. Outstanding! Well worth a visit. It is a fabulous sight.  You don't have to go into the attraction to view the poppies.,"Just want to see poppies, its free"
"August 24, 2014","The poppies exhibition is completely visible without entering the tower, so if you want to see this amazing display, and I recommend you do before it goes 11th November then it wont cost you anything. You can see the  888,246 poppies project one for every life lost in 1914 war as a work in progress as the volunteers carry out this great project.If entering the tower itself you can save by booking on line but be aware that the receipt states to present this to group bookings, a little kiosk alongside the other pay on the day kiosk which does open until 09:50, 10 mins before opening and large queues already forming. The staff are efficient though and work the queues checking everyone in the right place. My family ticket enabled me to take my receipt direct to the group entrance by traitors gate without exchanging for a ticket and was a fast track route.I recommend heading straight for the crown jewels display on arrival. We did this and was able to walk straight the the main display of crowns without queue. 15 minutes later the queue was already out on the courtyard and after 30 mins passed open time the metal zig zag barriers were full.",Poppies At The Tower
"August 4, 2014","We just went to see The Poppies. Each one represents a life lost in WW1. Very moving and very beautiful to look at, and free! There are about 100000 there at the moment but by November there will be 860000. We will be back again to see it finished.  Well worth a look at. Gorgeous.",Brilliant place to visit...and wonderful 'Beefeater' tourguide!
"July 28, 2014","We had visited a few years ago but, with new foster children who had never visited London before, decided to go back. Our tickets we prebooked via another website, and it averaged £10 per person (well worth it). The entry queue was about 15 minutes (we visited end July 2014), but this included the security bag checks. We were immediately caught up in the 'Beefeater' tour on the bridge - the crowd was very large, but the guide was impressive, fun, included lots of stories and projected his voice well. It was a great 'quick run' around the grounds with introduction to the history, before being able to spend a few hours going around at our own pace. The guide even pointed out the best 'route' to take to avoid the longer queues. The majority of the Tower is as you would expect - an ancient building, with lots of rooms, stairs and history. This is not a 'tourist attraction' so other than the guides, don't go if you want to be entertained or led through room by room. The crown jewels were beautiful, and reading there history etc added to the impact - we queued for about 15 minutes to get in (have waited longer for a bus personally, so not bothered), which was mainly due to the numbers being managed, so it wasn't too crowded inside and we were able to spend as much or as little time as we wanted looking at everything. Other areas generally include staged 'rooms' or historic/timeline displays, but our kids thought it was amazing and had loads and loads of questions about kings and queens, who died and when.....The only negative we had on the day was the restaurant in the old armoury - for 2 adults and 3 children to eat a sandwich and a drink cost over £50 so recommend taking your own food/drink, or wait until you are outside the Tower.",Amazing
"July 22, 2014","My boyfriend and I spent 4 hours here and still didn't want to leave but had to because we had a schedule to keep. There is so much history here that you need more then one day to take it all in. Not to mention the gorgeous grounds and castle. If you like history that delves deep into kings, queens, knights, torture, executions, royalty, jewels, armor, battles, and life of a Londoner through history this place is for you. I would go back in a heartbeat.",One Of The Top Attractions in London
"July 17, 2014",You can learn so much of History when you visit  Tower of London.  Allow sufficient time for the visit. It is recommended that you start early in  the morning when the Crowds are thin. Crown Jewels are the Star Attraction and you visit it first so that your time is saved. The exhibits are well explained and you learn a lot. We spent nearly four hours and you could spend the whole day visiting the Towers as it has much to offer. An enjoyable visit.,A must see
"July 14, 2014","If you are going to be in London, you must visit the Tower of London.  It is easy to get to (by tube or bus), and you can take a tour given by Beefeaters.  Unfortunately my son did not have much patience and my husband is hard of hearing, so we simply wandered the place on our own and read all the posted information we could.  Do not be discouraged if the line to see the Crown Jewels is about a mile long - that line moved incredibly quickly, and the jewels are definitely something that should be seen!!  The place was beautiful, and the history incredible.  We had a wonderful time there!",Great site
"July 4, 2014","Great place to visit. Get there early and see the Crown Jewels first. We did that and were able to walk right in and look leisurely. Later, the line was very long. Next, take a Yeoman tour. They are great and then you can look more closely at things that interest you after the tour.",Cool- but have a plan!!
"June 18, 2014",Buy your tickets the day or 2 before. Just tell them what day you want to come. The ticket window opens at the same time the tower opens..... So if you buy them in advance- you can get in first thing. Get there 15 min before opens- get in line to go in. Go straight for the Crown Jewels. 20 min after it opened- there was already a line to see them. ( there are signs directing you). They are lovely and should not be missed. After the jewels- join a beefeater tour ( they start by the moat) or walk around on own. It's fun and bigger than you think. We spent 3 hours there and had a great time. ,A dark tower of history!
"June 8, 2014","We were so glad to buy the London pass. Again we skipped the long lines and saw this fabulous castles, learned about the history, executions and learned about the castles' history.  The Queen's jewels were beautiful.  Hint:  go early and get in the line for the jewels first!",Excellent in every respect
"June 3, 2014","It was throwing it down with rain and I was a bit put off by the entry price of £22 per adult, but it was worth every penny! We spent all day on site, there was sooooooo much to see and do! Lots of interesting exhibits, helpful staff and nice short tours around the main sights.  The Crown Jewels were a real treat! On the practical side, lots of loos, cafés and shops ..... Great day out! ",Overpriced and boring
"May 27, 2014","Not a whole lot to say, flushed 20£ down the toilet just to see another heavily commercialized watered down medevil attraction. There wasnt much in the way of sights, just a few plaques and armor suites, I think thr crown jewels were the only interesting feature of the place. Save yourself the time and money and go shopping instead.",The Crown Jewels and the Yeoman Tour
"July 1, 2013","Buy your tickets online, go to the desk to pick them up about 20 minutes before they open.  When the gates open, go straight to the Crown Jewels before the crowds, then go back to the entry to catch the next Yeoman tour.  The Yeoman tour was very entertaining and one of the highlights for our trip to London.",Take the yeoman's (Beefeaters) tour when you go
"June 29, 2013","I saw the Tower of London back in the 60's so I was happy to do it a little differently this time.  We did the yeoman's tour first and our yeoman (Mitch) was very informative and the tour was a lot of fun.  It gives you a more personal insight into the Tower(s).  Oh, and here's a tip - the answer is 20.  Trust me.  Afterwards we quickly toured the white tower.  I say quickly because we weren't interested in spending a lot of time looking at medieval hardware, etc.  We then toured the tower where Sir Walter Raleigh had stayed (the Bloody Tower I think?) which was of interest since I'm from Raleigh.  If you go up the stairs then be warned that they are very steep and narrow.  We did not look at the crown jewels.  The line was over an hour long and I'd seen them before.  Note:  We bought our tickets at the Traders Post store, which Rick Steves said can be faster when there are lines.  We got a senior discount as well.",DO NOT miss this!
"June 20, 2013","The Tower of London is an amazing place, even in the pouring rain! We purchased the London Pass which would have allowed us to skip the queue but we were there right at opening (9:00am) so we went right in.I would highly recommend going early and heading straight for the Crown Jewels in the Jewel House. We went directly in and were able to spend a good amount of time admiring the jewels ad reading about them. By the time we were finished, the lines to get in was incredible!We took a Beefeater Yeoman tour (free) and he was so good at giving out information and was a stitch to listen to. The tour ends in the Royal Chapel next to the execution site where Anne Boleyn and others lost their heads. The history of this site is truly amazing.The White Tower with it’s armor and weapons display was incredible. The Bloody Tower which contains the executioner’s block and ax and other means of torture. Sir Walter Raleigh’s apartment was there and the staircase where the Boy Princes remains were found. Sounds gory but that is what history is about.",Fun Day out!
"June 9, 2013","My boyfriend and I visited for the first time as adults in May 2013.  We did feel a little guilty about going to a castle without the kids, but it was nice to take our time and read things rather than being rushed along to get to the ice creams at the end!There was a long queue for the Crown Jewels, but it was worth it.  It was good having the guide too, as we read a few interesting facts in there! Overall, it was a great day out and we are looking forward to going again with the kids when they are all a bit older and will be properly interested in history!",Incredible
"May 26, 2013","If you appreciate history, this is a must see. Off all my travels, this was one of the most incredible sites I have seen. Just fabulous. The Yeoman tour is very historical (and accurate). The crown jewels are stunning. And any Tudor fan will appreciate standing in the very spot that Anne Boleyn was killed. This is a must see.",Tower Fantastic - Yeoman Warder Mark outstanding!
"May 18, 2013",A first time visit for us & our 9 & 5 year old children. Blown away by the place. The significance of the history really hits you. Mark Anderson was our Yeoman Warder tour guide and he is just outstanding. Comic timing & repartee brilliant from start to finish. Hussar! ,A cold day at the Tower
"April 24, 2013","Visited London the first week of April, 2013, tthe coldest Easter season in 100 years. So we bundled up and took off. The Tower of London is not to be missed. Took the great advice from others in this forum, went early  and headed straight for the Jewels, while everyone else was waiting for a Yeoman Tour. Even on this cold day there were a good bit of people. Got in without a  wait viewed the Jewels at leasure then went back to catch the tour. The tour is free and fantastic !  Expect to spend 2 and a half to three hours. BY the way, there always seems to be a long line at the tourture display. Like everyone else we joined in. After the longest wait of the Tower we viewed a rack. This would be the only thing I would skip. You can always look up a picture of this torture device on line. In Short, The Tower is the must see for a first timer.",MUST SEE IN LONDON!!  Do the tour with the Beefeater
"April 12, 2013","It's a little overwhelming.  You buy a ticket and people try to sell you a tour book or an audio guide.  They barely mention that real beefeaters offer tours that are included in your ticket.The tour is a MUST!  You will truly miss out of you don't take it.  It lasts 1 hour.  The coolest part?  A Beefeater must have at least 22 years of military experience, still be active military, take a written and oral exam and then show military skills before being hired.  Only 37 Beefeaters in England and they are considered the Queen's personal body guards.  They LIVE in the tower and guard it every day.  So, one of the Queen's personal body guards is your guide.Definitely give yourself at least 3-4 hours to see everything.  While the line to the Crown Jewels may seem ridiculous you should know that it takes about 25-30 minutes if it is filled all the way through the ropes.  Not too bad if you are into a lot of gold and diamonds.",Sadly disappointing and carelessly set out
"April 4, 2013","After happily paying the extortionate entry fee, I was incredibly excited to finally visit the tower of London. As a self-taught history buff, the tower has always topped my list of visits and after visiting as many castles in the UK as my free time would allow, it was finally time to visit the king of historical sites. To say I was disappointed with the experience would be an understatement. The outside is certainly imposing and broods with promise. However, once you get past the hideously modern entry gates, you discover that the history of the castle has been stripped away or locked away and all that remains are bare walls unadorned with information, exhibits or even tapestries! The guide book contains some information which may help the visitor to apply history to the bare buildings but is of course impossible to read while trying to navigate the crowds and towers. The main attraction for me was the history, the buildings and the church. The church was closed to visitors and the buildings were stripped bare and consequently interchangeable. We came across the tower where the Duke of Clarence was drowned in his barrell of wine entirely by accident, hidden under some scaffolding. The crown jewels seem to be the main attraction and although mildly interesting, are only seen briefly after huge queues. It felt as if the tower was more interested in getting your money than educating or entertaining its visitors.Whoever curates this historical site is at best struggling with huge expectation and few resources. They should try paying the visitor fee and viewing the site as a history enthusiast and they might review its presentation.",To many steps
"March 26, 2013",Not disabled friendly to few ramps and cafe closes to early no order in crown jewels display people pushing every way spoiled it for us,Don't skip it
"November 7, 2013",We skipped the tower on our first London trip. This time we went and loved it. The tour was good and the sense of history amazing!! The Crown Jewels were a highlight. ,Excellent; plan on at least two days
"September 28, 2013","This is an incredible experience to learn about the history of Great Britain from the standpoint of its monarchy.  There is so much to see, from the guided tours by Yeoman Warders (commonly called Beefeaters), to the Crown Jewels, there is so much to see and do.  The Yeoman Warders, who are not tour guides, but part of a centuries old tradition of being part of the personal bodyguard of the monarch, are informative and entertaining.  The in-house cafeteria is also worth a visit, whether for a cuppa to warm up on a cold English fall day, or for a plate of traditional fish, chips and mushy peas.  If you want to truly enjoy the experience, and see everything, then you should plan on at least two days at the Tower.  Enjoy!",Bring History Alive At The Tower
"September 24, 2013","Will capture the imagination of medieval and tudor history lovers, jewel lovers, and castle lovers.  I live fairly close to the Tower and it is one of my favourite London landmarks. I think tourists sometimes imagine it will be a huge tower but it is actually a sprawling castle set on the North Bank of the Thames and is right next to Tower Bridge too.Tips: Take a Yeoman Warder Tour and hear the history of the tower through their lively re-tellings. Another way of getting the most out of your visit is if you pay attention to the information placards dotted around all over the place. Also, if you are a resident of Tower Hamlets, take some proof of address and ID with you and you can get into the Tower for just £1 rather than the usual ticket price! (Check online first to make sure this offer is still valid.) Leave plenty of time for your visit as there is a lot to see and learn about (I recommend 2-3 hours.)Things to Visit Inside: The White Tower Exhibition, THe Crown Jewels Exhibition, The Water Gate (where Queen Anne Boleyn was brought into the Tower by boat before her execution.)Location and Amenities: Tower Hill station is the closest tube station. Amenities outside the Tower: There as some cafes and a fast food restaurant (KFC) near the tower (by the ticket office) as well as a couple of Starbucks cafes. There is also a variety of good restaurants 3 to 5 minutes walk away in St Katherine Docks (ask for directions as these are on the embankment level, lower than street level, so not immediately visible from the streets around the castle but they are very close by.) Once you are inside inside the Tower there are toilets and cafes.Nearby Attractions: Tower Bridge and St Katherine docks. Also London Bridge and the London Dungeons are in this vicinity so if you plan on visiting those, maximise your time by doing so on the same day.",HALT! Who goes there!
"September 17, 2013","Love love love the Tower of London!  What a fantastic spine tingling place this is!  Not only is this the home of the Crown Jewels my friends but has to be home to some of THE most important historical moments in British history.  I recommend a self guided audio tour which is at your leisure and of course you can press repeat on those all important facts! Go the extra dollars for the audio - you will thank me later!  Allow at least two hours for this attraction, you can get lost listening to all the stories and dont forget to check out Traitors Gate and the bloody tower with spooky stories of torture!  Take a photo with the ravens which are kept at the Tower Grounds - as the story goes, if there are no Ravens at the Tower of London then the Monarch will fall!",Should be called Tower of Queues-not for young children!
"August 25, 2013","I love history and was so excited to go to the place where so many historic British events have happened but I was very disappointed.  The queues were terrible, to buy a ticket we stood for so long in the pouring rain, at least half an hour and then the young 'lady' at the till selling the tickets was so rude and unhelpful I was tempted to just turn around and say forget it.  I found most of the staff quite sullen and considering where they are working and how many International people they meet, they really do give a miserable impression of this great historic site to the public.  DO NOT TAKE YOUNG CHILDREN!  I saw so many crying children in pushchairs, they looked totally fed up, the stairs and 'landscape' of the whole place is completely unsuitable for babies and buggy's!  Yes some parts were interesting but the sheer volume of people just made the experience disappointing, you are pushing up against hoards of people and waiting and waiting in queues! The cafe is pure chaos, never want to go back there again.  Oh dear I'm trying to remember the good bits, the crown jewels, those 15 minutes looking at them were memorable but I will never go back again.  The ticket was so expensive and for what I paid the experience just not worth it, I wish I had gone to the Victoria and Albert museum instead and that's free.",Don't be too early
"August 8, 2013","I love the Tower and have visited it multiple times.  On this last visit though I learnt something useful for future visits.  Don't be too early.  the bonus is that there aren't queues to get in early, but the very very big downside is that the first Beefeater tour of the day is too large for you to hear your Beefeater if you're at the back of the queue.  Later in the day there seem to be less folk waiting for tours to start.",A great family day out. Steeped in history.
"August 6, 2013","We just fancied seeing the Crown Jewels. We knew the rest of it and thought it would be just another castle to stroll around. How wrong we were. We took advice from earlier reviewers. We arrived at the gates at 9am. The queue was about 50 deep ahead of us. We did as was suggested and made a beeline for the Crown Jewels. It was great to zip straight in - no queues - saunter about, study stuff, see it then go back and see it again. All without the clutter of other people crowding you out. The room where The Queen's Crown is has a moving floor on both sides. This would be to keep the hoardes moving when it gets busy. Which as we found out was just as we exited the building. The next piece of advice we were given by the same reviewer was to take the Beefeater's Walking Tour at 10am. This would allow us access to St Peter's Chapel which you would otherwise not be allowed into. Our Beefeater was Mitch Jones a cunning Welsh linguist who made the tour incredibly humourous and knowledgeable and interesting and he was playing to old folk and kids alike. There is no extra to pay for the tour but you will be asked to donate alms inside the Chapel so take some coins. After this we were free to roam about as we wished. By the time we finished our tour the queue for the Crown Jewels was now hours long and looked incredibly uncomfortable. Thank you to the person who took the trouble to give that initial advice which we took.My advice to you would be to take a portable picnic and carry water bottles enough for you. The prices are high being a tourist venue and London. We ate in the café and a meal of soup for me, cod n chips for the kids and a sandwich for the wife came to around £30.00 The food was really nice and very filling, (even the soup). But if you came on a budget my advice would be to bring a picnic. A bottle of water (very small) is £1.60. You will find plenty of benches dotted around to sit on.The White Tower houses an amazing museum of historical armour and weapons. It is my final ""must see"" at the Tower of London. We got there by tube train. We were there from 9am to 3:30pm and paid £58.89 for our family of 2 adults and 2 kids below 10yrs old - this included the guide book which we only had time to read when we were out and back at the hotel. I can heartily recommend this as a """"Must See"" part of your visit to London.",Favorite
"August 4, 2013",6 and 9 year old and wife and I loved it.  Make to get there by tube then get tix at the shop by the tube stop.  Get there when it opens and go straight to the Crown Jewels which can be seen in twenty minutes.  If you get there later you will wait in line with a few hundred of your closest friends.  Then go back to the entrance near the moat to get a free beefeater tour- we had a marine fellow who was great.  That great tour takes an hour.  See if you can catch the changing of the guard who march right through the crowd- awesome close up opportunity.  Then white tower for 45 mins.  Then wander randomly to some of the side rooms.  Brilliant time.,Love love love it!!!!!
"July 2, 2013","I don't know how you could say anything negative about this incredible historic venue. The Beefmaster's tour was fascinating and set the stage for the remainder of the visit.  The Crown Jewels had a long line but it really moved quickly. Unlike other museums, this one can be enjoyed even with crowds.  The history is incredible, the grounds were immaculate, the gift shops were lovely. I wish I had more time to spend here. Teenagers and hubby enjoyed it just as much as I did.",Busy Venue
"July 2, 2013","Fabulous Venue but too may stairs in the White Tower , Queue for the crown jewels was around 30 mins long, Good beefeaters very knowledgeable. 1 Lemonade & 1 Bottle of Pepsi £4.30 bit steep as the lemonade was only a small cup not a bottle or can  ",Beware of the voluntary donation
"March 19, 2013","I am sure others have stated this here before. I admit I did not check the reviews prior to visiting this attraction. After all it's the ""Tower of London"". it was more a MUST do than a WANT to do on my list.I was positivley surprised, by the effort they put in and the tour they offered was worth the hefty entrance fee.But beware the entrance fee they charge per default includes a ""voluntary donation"" if you do not wish to donate you have to ask explicitley for a ticket without donation. Which I did, because I am the persone who voluntary donates, just not if forced to do so!To be fare it wasn't a problem at all. I just had to reveal myself as a non caring person who does not which to support a cause that's not clearly stated. Because all they say is that it is a donation not whatever for it is used.They'll give you a big thank you on your ticket though. My friend got one. She wasn't to happy, because she didn't realize she actually volunteered.",Day Visit to Tower of London
"February 15, 2013","Day trip on the 14th February 2013. On arrival at the entrance i asked where I could get tickets. A pair of guides said ""Up the hill"". Then they continued their own conversation. Most of the guides had a similar attitude. The crown jewels and the Royal Armouries displays have been reduced in size significantly, since my last visit. Very dissappointing. Not much to see around the site. A few cannons dotted here and there. The guide, a Yoeman, gave loads of statistics and if you interupted his speil, which was obviously a standard patter, he got annoyed.£45 for Two seniors and one child. Certainly NOT value for money. A very dissappointing visit.The ticket price also gave a ""Donation"". to what? i never found out. And certainly no option to opt out. Dont bother going","More than just jewels, a thousand years of English history in one place"
"January 13, 2013","Went with my seven-year-old, and we both had a fantastic time seeing how the history of England progressed, with the Tower playing an integral role in so many events. Whether you are a first time visitor to London or have lived here all your life, everyone should see this at least once. Worth every penny. My tip - take a Thames river cruise from Westminster Pier and arrive by boat, just like the many people in history who arrived that way, never to leave...","Wonderful day out - allow time, pre-purchase to save queueing"
"January 12, 2013","Had originally arrived at the Tower at 14:40 (having spent more time than planned at the wonderful HMS Belfast) and contemplated a quick 2/3 hour tour, but wasn't convinced if that was a good idea. We spoke to the cashier who rightly advised us to come back the next morning, and also recommended we pre-booked on the internet, as that allows you to collect your tickets at the Group bookings cashdesks, which have considerably smaller / no queues. Great tip if you're limited for time and want to avoid the long buy-on-the-day queues.The Tower tour was great. We didn't follow the 'guides' as the crowd around them were enormous. Instead we took a couple of audio guides and a map. Yes, the masses of visitors is hard to handle at first, but providing you're patient you get used to it.   I recommend you visit all of the different areas of the Towers as they all have a different story to tell. In the end we spent around 6 hours there, taking our time and letting our girls see everything they wanted to. ",great to visit
"January 5, 2013",it's about 30 years since I last went and it's transformed for the good in every respect - you could spend a day there - i was there for half a day with my 15yr old son - very well done indeed,Wow!  It's fun being a tourist!
"December 23, 2012","We were completely blown away by this place.  Expected to be there for an hour, hour and a half - we were there for FOUR AND A HALF HOURS!  The most amazing place ever,  We hired headsets, which I would highly recommend, which made the whole thing so much fun.  The players who walk around and play out scenarios were brilliant and very atmospheric.  I would very much like to go again to relive things and to see what I'm sure I must have missed,",Headless body found in topless castle.
"December 21, 2012",If you have time for only one attraction in London this is the one.The tour is included with your admission and begin every half hour on the hour under the main entrance archway. The tour guides are the famous beefeaters ( yeoman warders ) who mix history and humor in entertaining fashion and leave you wanting for more when they depart. Once the tours are over you have all day to explore the Crown Jewels and the many towers which populate the grounds.A must see in the bloody tower is the medevil torture device called the spluge of the joo.,Walk the Roman Wall around Roman London
"December 17, 2012","Start at the Tower of London, and follow the route of the Roman Wall back to the River Thames near St Paul's Cathedral.Try going to the Museum of London, 150 London Wall, London EC2Y 5HN and visiting the Roman exhibition. Use this as a starting point to walk the Roman Wall, parts of which still remain in buildings, much of it uncovered due to Blitz damage in World War 2. The Wall extends from the Tower of London, around to St Paul's Cathedral. In the 1980s the Museum of London put up a series of information panels on the route of the walk but these have mostly been vandalised so you will need to do a little research in order to find the route. A good place to start is at the Museum of London, which is halfway around the Roman Wall route.There are some serious treasures on the route, not least of which is the Roman Colisseum in the basements of London Guildhall - amazing exhibition! However, for me, walking the Wall gave me a much greater understanding of how London developed - almost all of what we would now know as the City of London was within the Wall, and helps one to realise what a compact and small place London really is (or was)!!",Really pretty poor day out
"October 31, 2012","I took my family to the tower of London yesterday and had pretty high expectations of the day out. I had got the 2 for one tickets which still rather confusingly worked out at £46 for the four of us even though the family ticket was £56. I was expecting queues in the place given how popular the place was and they were substantial although actually moved relatively quickly. We went straight for the Crown Jewels tower first as that had the largest queue and it would hopefully be easier after that for other towers to visit.Once we made it into the actual tower with the Crown Jewels it’s a conga line event through largely empty rooms with only the barest nod towards any information or context of where you are. Getting into the actual room you are then on a moving pavement that takes you past the main case with the jewels in it. I would say that they are beautiful and well light but you get all of about 60 seconds before you are at the other end. There is a moving pavement on the other side but the place is seriously packed and you are competing with the hordes that are streaming in to get a second glance at them. Once past the main cases there are several other smaller exhibition cases with other artefacts in them including a beautiful punch bowl that you could almost swim in, but again there are so many people it’s hard to actually spend anymore than a minute at the cases before you’re swamped with people pushing in wanting to see. After leaving the Crown Jewels we went to the tower that had the torture exhibits in it. Again there was a queue but this was relatively small and we got in to the room in about 10 minutes. Once inside there were only two actual things to look at and one of them was a replica. We spent all of about 30 seconds in the room before going back out.Once we left this exhibit we decide to leave the Tower and go for something to eat. I asked my sons, aged 11 and 14, what they thought of it and they both said it was pretty boring which I have to say I agreed with.Overall my impression of the place is it is set up more for crowd control rather than actually showing off the exhibits or providing an entertaining and value for money day out. The torture museum was spectacularly bad considering both the history and also the amount of these types of artefacts that are still in existence. Given that the Tower of London has got to be one of the major tourist attractions in the whole of the UK I was astonished a just how bad the place was and how it was set up.",Not really worth £20.90 to get in ... spend your hard earned quid elsewhere
"October 20, 2012","The only attraction that sparked the slightest interest for me were the crown jewels. I was absolutely captivated by the sparkles that I kept leaning forward to get a closer look since I'm blind as a bat ... only to knock my head against a very clear & Windex clean glass window. My girl friend was wondering what the heck I was doing leaning so close until she heard a loud clink sound. Lucky no one else heard or saw & we pissed ourselves laughing. THAT was the highlight of this attraction. And that's all.The torture tower was a snoozefest & I thought whatever big rolling pins they had to stretch & rip apart limbs was like a sun bake in the beach. For the ultimate torture equipment, the Germans & Hungarians know their shiet. Go visit Bran Castle, not only is it more historically interesting & hauntingly beautiful, but its conveniently located in Romania so you can explore the rest of this fascinating country! I like London for its food, shopping & architecture, but most of the main attractions ... dear god! Not worth your $$ nor time. (Unless you are big on English history). Overall, I spent £20 to headbutt the crown jewels. Hmmm ... impressive. Next! ",Beefeaters are a feast
"January 7, 2012",The Beefeaters are a feast everyone can enjoy - even vegetarians! They know their stuff and convey it well and wittily. The Crown Jevels are an absolute must and a triumph of both content and presentation.,Much more than expected
"January 7, 2012",Busy and expensive to get in but very historical.  Could easily spend a day there if interested in British history.  Would have preferred a tour option that gave less detail.,Real London History
"January 7, 2012","Take the tour, that way you don't miss anything.  I visited over 50 years ago and it still has the charm and magic it had for me as a child.  Well worth a visit","You can feel the history, it almost feels wrong to be wearing 'modern' clothing."
"January 7, 2012","Go early in the day because you'll likely want to spend an entire morning or afternoon there.Take a guided tour by one of the Beefeaters (just wait inside the gate with the crowd, they come every 15 minutes).  This will give you an overview and point out some of the more well-known areas (Traitor's Gate, The White Tower, Crown Jewels etc).Then take some time just to wander about.  Start at the White Tower (don't forget the souvenir shop in the basement).  There's armour, weaponry, a room decorated in the Tudor style, including the sounds and smells (yes, smells) of 'yore'.Most of the walls allow you to walk on top of them, giving you access to numerous rooms and cells as well.The Crown Jewels are also housed here and definitely worth a look.",Tower tours

"January 5, 2012","Briliant place to visit. It's an all day event. It's like going back in time. One sees  how the nobility lived compared to the solders, serfs and the like lived boct in the 1600's",Crown Jewels Dazzling
"January 5, 2012",While in London my niece and I went to the Tower of London for a visit.  We saw the Royal Crown Jewels  (lots & lots of them)!!!  Other fascinating features of the tower include the dungeon torture room of course - essential to any medieval castle life.  Another legendary thing we had heard about but needed to see for ourselves were the crows of the Tower of London.  They are huge!!  I have never seen birds like these and we made a video of them.  They are truly majestic.  The Tower of London is on the Thames riverbank and you have a very nice view of London Bridge and the river.  You will be very glad to see this World Heritage Site.  Don't miss it!,Back into history
"January 5, 2012",Any history buff will love to step back in time at The Tower of London.  The displays are always great and the Crown Jewels are worth a visit.  Much of the display at The Tower revolves around the ugly part of the violent history of England but it is part of the growth of humanity and should always be remembered.  We should all know about the past so we can appreciate the present. ,What a sight to behold
"January 5, 2012","History buffs, and those who just like interesting places, people and things, prepare to have a blast. Cant think of anything negative to say. Do were comfortable shoes, and be prepared to walk up hills and stairs.",just brilliant!!!!
"December 10, 2011",well worth the money to visit. we arrived in time to get a tour of the tower with one of the beef eater guides and he just brought all the tales to life i was mesmerised. the place is totally fantastic and a trip i will not forget. seeing the crown jewels was amazing and the ravens too. just brilliant!!!,A Great London Experience
"August 4, 2011","Throughly enjoyed our visit.  Be sure to allow yourself enough time to view everything, at least 4 hours.  We took a beefeater tour to start and them followed the audio guide throughout the site for the remainder of our time.  The line for the crown jewels was quite long on a Wednesday afternoon but it moved along quickly, so don't be put off.  The crown jewels and beefeater tour were the highlight of the visit.  We purchased our tickets in advance on their website and skipped a bit of queue time.",London's Premier Historical Site
"August 1, 2011","As an annual member of the Royal Palaces, I've been to the Tower of London three times in the past 12 months. Firstly, on a sidenote, I recommend visitors to get off at Monument tube station opposed to Tower Hill. The monument is a 300+ step column that was erected as a memorial in the wake of the Great Fire of London in 1666 and offers some great views of London.The Tower of London is a magnificent castle that is perched on the River Thames next to London Bridge. During my first visit I did the guided tour which I recommend for first-timers as it is conducted by one of the resident Beefeaters, is entertaining, informative and witty. I'm not usually a fan of guided tours but at this particular attraction I found the information relative and engaging. Within the grounds there are a number of different sectors to visit. The newly launched Beasts section is something of a disappointment even if the information is quite interesting (apparently Henry VIII kept a Polar Bear on the grounds!). The two highlights for me are the crown jewels along with a bloodline of heritage of the royals, videos of the various royal weddings and the jewels used at the royal ceremonies including the Queens crown etc. The second most fascinating part is the armory used by Henry VIII and other royalty that it remarkably well-kept and intricate in detail. There is a lot of showcase of weapons and armory with fantastic design. The grounds are also host to a war museum, the bloody tower, the site where Anne Boleyn was beheaded, the prisoners tower with preserved inscriptions dating back hundreds of years, the superstitious ravens (rumour has it that the tower will crumble if they ever leave) and other bits and bobs. All in all you could spend an entire day here and it would be well spent. One of the top attractions in London and offers so much.",Ensure that you have atleast 3-4 hours to really enjoy this...
"July 29, 2011",This is one of the must do's in london..... lots of history and stories are there about his place and the best place to heat them is to take the warden tour...Do make sure that you spare good 4 hours for this attraction as you would need to wait for 30-45 mins in the queue for the crown jewels and the warden tour is 1-1.25 hours long. You need to take time out to see the rest of the place yourself.Dont forget to get a glance of the Tower Bridge right next to the Tower of London....,Ceremony of the Keys
"July 25, 2011","A must do and it's FREE! Each night at the Tower they have a ceremony that is the traditional locking up of the Tower of London and has taken place on each and every night, without fail, for at least 700 years. It happens at 9:30 pm and they only let about 40 people take part each night. You have to write away for the tickets but they are free and it is a really interesting ceremony with lots of pomp and tradition, as you would expect! It's mice to be there without all the crowds of the daytime plus you are seeing something that really not that many people know about or have done. The address to get tickets is on this website http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/WhatsOn/ceremonyofthekeys.aspxand they recommend having 3 or 4 alternate dates that you can come.I highly recommend doing this if you can while you are in London. You won't be disappointed!",EXCELLENT DAY OUT
"July 15, 2011","We visited the site on Monday 11/07/11 arriving around 10.30am we had booked tickets via the internet which we collected from the information centre at Tower Hill so avoiding the queues which had already formed at the ticket offices. Entrance into the Tower took only a few minutes, the security staff searching bags at the entrance are obviously bored with their jobs and need an atitude change but the rest of the staff are helpful and readily supply information and help wherever possible.The Tower is full of interesting items and historical facts and its well worth following one of the outlined tours around the castle.Allow yourself a good few hours to see everything properly, but be aware as the days goes on the crowds get worse, so the earlier you start the better.Plenty of places to sit down and relax on a fine day.Great value for money if you enjoy history.If you want a good photo of the Ravens get your sandwiches out they will soon find you !",Don't miss out! The Tower is a must!
"July 5, 2011","My husband, myself and our three university aged children were on a once in a lifetime family holiday together from Australia. The Tower of London was a highlight of our visit to London! We all loved  soaking up the atmosphere. The ghosts of famous historical figures of the past such as Elizabeth 1, Anne Boleyn, William the Conqueror etc seemed almost to be standing amongst us! What amazing history!  We all loved our visit and want to come again!",Plan To Stay At Least Half A Day
"June 27, 2011",We originally budgeted only a couple of hours for this site but spent more than half a day here! The size of the tower is immense and the history is very well presented. You must take a beefeater tour! The cafe here is also very good. Their sausages are the best ones we had in England!,arrive early and beat the crowds
"June 21, 2011","I arrived at the Tower of London at 10am and had no wait to buy tickets or see the crown jewels, which were astounding. The armory display in the White Tower was interesting as well but the highlight was a tour by a Beefeater with a keen sense of humor. I had a great time and would recommend a visit when coming to London.",Where the medieval story books came alive!
"June 13, 2011","This place offered such an amazing look into the English medieval past. Our beefeater tour guide was very knowledgeable yet hilarious! Part of the time we were with the tour guide, the other part we explored the different towers on our own. The Tower of London is situated next to the famous London Tower Bridge so be sure to capture your photos from the Tower facing the Bridge! Each of the towers served a different purpose and I was most fascinated with the White Tower (main one) and not to mention the tower that houses the crown jewels of the past English rulers! We stayed in Russell Square and took the Tube all the way out to Tower Hill and it was an enjoyable (somewhat scenic) ride. This is a must in London!",Great way to spend a morning!
"June 13, 2011","We were able to take a Beefeater tour and visit the Tower of London complex in a few short hours, however if you are super interested in the armor displays you will want to give yourself some more time.  Loved the Beefeater tour, in fact our guide was the Raven Keeper as well!  He was great.  The Crown Jewels were awesome, however I was disappointed that there weren't any tiaras on display.  One tip! We purchased a Historic Royal Palaces Joint Membership which allowed us free access to Tower of London, Kensington Palace (which we ended up not visiting due to the awful reviews), Hampton Court Palace, among others.  This saved us money (or at minimum broke even), however it's worth the money even if only visiting 1 palace---we skipped all lines completely and walked right to the final ticket gates, showed the card, and walked right through. You also get a souvenir book and a 10% discount at gift shops.  Highly recommended to do this!",Absolutely Fabulous
"August 27, 2023","Absolutely  fabulous .. I went with my family and young Grandchildren. I had visited the Tower many many years ago and it really didn't disappoint.. We had an 11 am entry and thought we would have a long wait for the Crown Jewels, but we were so lucky and although we joined the queue we waited around 10 mins before getting in.We then went back to join the the next tour which is in my opinion is a 'must do' .. we had the amazing Andy Terry who was a wealth of information and held the audience with a mix of comedy too!Make sure you leave enough time to see it all 4-6 hours is what I would suggest.  It is quite costly with a large family but you can shop around for discounts, we used the 'lottery days out' vouchers through British Heritage.We are steeped in so much History and it is wonderful to see the Tourists in awe of what we are lucky to have here.","One of the ""must do"" activities in London -"
"August 26, 2023","Definitely take the free tour!  The Warders are knowledgable, and funny!  The Tower is a ""must do"" for anyone visiting London for the first time.  The line-up to see the Crown Jewels appears very long, but the new system they have - it moves quickly!  There is SO much to see, and after you have heard the info - everything makes much more sense & is more interesting. ",Must See When in London
"August 25, 2023",I consider the Tower of London a must-see. The main attraction is the Crown Jewels but the history of the palace and the tower is fascinating as well.,Crown Jewels Did Not Disappoint!
"August 14, 2023",I had always wanted to visit the Tower of London and was thrilled when I had an extra day to do so. My main objective was to see the Crown Jewels and I was not disappointed!  What a fabulous venue to be immersed in history.,Must See-Allow 3 hrs.+
"August 11, 2023","I last visited Tower of London in 1970. Vastly updated with enhanced visitor opportunities and greater access since then. The self-guided aspects are A+, extremely informative; begin with the Beefeater tour First,as orientation. Staff in period costumes stay in character so one feels immersed in the historic period. Do not stop your visit with a quick trip to the Crown Jewels! Take advantage of everything!Clean, safe, and fantastic in very way.",Highlight of our London visit!
"July 29, 2023","Our entire family found our tour of the Tower of London to be one of the highlights of our visit to the city this summer. So much incredible history.We booked our tickets in advance on-line and made sure to arrive on time for the Yeoman tour, which made all the difference. Our beefeater was very knowledgeable, funny and entertaining. The entire visit took more than 3 hours and frankly we could have stayed much longer, exploring the various chambers and taking in the spontaneous ""plays"" recreating past events.Don't visit London without visiting the Tower!",Interesting & Macabre Bit of History
"July 28, 2023","Purchasing and using the tickets through Tripadvisor went smoothly. They just scanned the code at the entrance. We went on a rainy Saturday morning around 9:30-10 and were concerned when we saw lines formed, but it turned out to be mostly tour groups so we walked right in with our tickets. The yeoman tour was very entertaining-highly recommended! We hit the crown jewels right after which was busy but we were still able to get up to the cases to see the exhibits, maybe waiting a minute for someone else to move on at each spot. A significant line formed at the jewels by the time we exited which was after 10am. The white tower, bloody tower, and torture tower were also interesting if not a bit macabre. My 12 and 15 year olds found the experience interesting enough and maybe even soaked in a bit of history! We spent a little over 2 hours but you could easily spend more if you do the audio tours and read all the plaques, which my kids did not have the patience/energy to do.","Amazing tour by Beefeater Mark, lines go faster than they look!"
"June 23, 2023","We had an awesome visit to the Tower, and it sure didn't hurt that it was a gorgeous summer day. Our Beefeater Tour was given by Mark who was clearly concerned about whether we would say nice things about him on TripAdvisor. He needn't have fretted; for a decorated military man, he nevertheless nearly missed his calling as a raconteur and comedian. Clearly a well-chosen Yeoman Warder and an absolute treat for us to lead off our visit.Since it was hot and sunny and our kids are young, we groaned a little when we saw the line for the Crown Jewels exhibit stretching all the way down the hill; we joined the line back by the Cafe entrance. Shortly after we got in line, it got moving quite fast. At one point we passed a sign stating 20 minutes from that point to the jewels, and it was barely ten minutes; by 20 minutes, we were well into the jewels exhibit. This was our experience throughout the visit; while it was indeed crowded, all of the lines moved quite well and we didn't wait a long time to visit any of the buildings or exhibits, use restrooms, purchase meals or snacks, etc. Also they don't actively manage the size of the tour groups; the Beefeaters somehow manage to do their thing with whatever size mob shows up and follows them around, and yet - it works.For us, there was so much to see and do at the Tower that we spent most of the day there. Glad we didn't buy a London Pass because it seems tor really get your money's worth out of it, you have to make it to 2-3 of the attractions each day. I definitely feel like we got a good value and then some with our Tower of London standalone tickets and would not have liked feeling rushed to get on to the next London Pass site.",Great way to get some English history.
"June 5, 2023","Such history in this little place.  Be sure to go on the Beefeater tour to get the big overview.  Very good story tellers.  After the overview, take a deeper dive into the White Castle and other interesting spots.  You can easily spend half a day here.  There really is no way to see the Royal Jewels unless you go first thing when the doors open.  By noon, the line to enter see the jewels is just too much.",Terrible experience
"June 1, 2023","There were so many people blocking everything, you can’t see any signs so I didn’t know pictures weren’t allowed. I took my phone out and got a five minute lecture about how i was told THOUSANDS of times about it. Not a single person told me on my way in. Sorry your colleagues don’t take your job as seriously as you, crazy lady! I wasn’t arguing and immediately put my phone away but she felt this offputting lecture was necessary. I get you hate your job and life, but don’t take it out on people who are here for the first time and don’t know every one of your royal rules. God forbid someone photograph your pillaged jewels, colonizers!! ",You need a whole day here
"January 18, 2020",This is our 3rd trip with the kids in the last few years and but each time we only spent 4 hours there. You need a full day.You can get caught up in the Dinosaur and Mammal exhibitions but these should be done at the start of the or the end of the day when it’s quieter.I still haven’t explored the Darwin section of the museum which is the most recently built section.The robotic T-Rex is not accessible at the moment and this is a good feature for the kids. The queues to get in can be be big midday but these take around 20 minutes usually.,"Great during school, awful during holidays"
"July 28, 2020","I love this museum and have been going here periodically since a child. It's a really fun day out however...Do not, under ANY circumstance go during school holidays. It goes from being 5 star to 1 star. It becomes horribly overcrowded and you will spend hours queuing, starting outside just to get in. You will not be able to move about freely and are just shuffling along inside a mass of people.This may actually be one thing that coronavirus improves.",Great Museum to wander.
"May 17, 2020","The Natural History Museum in London is a great place to visit, for any age. There are wonderful displays of huge skeletons of dinosaurs and huge sea life plus models of a number of extinct creatures like the Dodo. As well as the permanent displays in various galleries there are always special exhibitions and on our last visit, we loved seeing the display of wildlife photographers – great photographs. Entrance to the Museum itself if free but one may need to pay for entry to the individual exhibits. There is a very good on-site shop not only for souvenirs but great books, DVDs and other resource materials. There is an onsite café which, frankly, was a huge disappointment, you’d be best to eat out in our experience. You need to allow around two hours at least to sample the delights of the Museum, longer if you visit one of the exhibitions.",Outstanding wonderful museum 
"February 28, 2020","This stunning building is well worth a visit, with so much on offer to view there is something for everyone to enjoy!My favourite part was the 78 stone monkeys carved into the arches of the ceiling. The disabled access was brilliant through out, lifts to upper floors (3 floors in total) We came from Manchester and it’s nothing like we have currently in a way of a museum! My husband, 7 year old son and 9 month old daughter, so we had a buggy. went on a week day and it was still busy but we didn’t feel it was over crowded.It’s free to enter, (donation is asked) we bought the £5 child booklet they had on offer with everything to keep your kids entertained while exploring the museum! And we made a donation for the Map for a keep sake. The dinosaur exhibit is by far outstanding! It was brilliant!! It’s by far a MUST SEE!The public toilets were good and clean and baby change also had a private curtained room for breast feeding. The cafe was in a lovely room to the left for the entrance, the staff was brilliant and very helpful! The lady who served my husband and son was so lovely making them a hot chocolate with marshmallows and costs were reasonable. Plenty of seating and tables also.They also have large shops we went into the dinosaur souvenir shop and had fun looking at the items.And the large museum shop which we couldn’t resist picking up a few souvenirs for us and the kids. Again the staff were very friendly and we would defiantly plan a visit again!  ",The history of the planet 
"March 1, 2020",This i a must visit especially if you are visiting London not very often. You will probably need day to discover the hidden natural treasures of this museum but i would strongly recommend to spend a whole day for the first visit. In most areas its free of charge entrance. Highly recommend. ,Not Enjoyable
"January 31, 2020","Visited on Saturday 25th but this was not an enjoyable visit far too crowded and no control over queues,especially bad in the dinosaur rooms instead off allowing so many in at the time, half way through a worker was shouting for everyone to keep moving meaning you could not stop to view any thing, the amount of people made it very unsafe. Was glad to leave. Maybe they should think about a charge for entry.",New Years Day visit
"January 1, 2020","After visiting London numerous times we decided that we had to visit this museum on our recent trip & I’m glad we did.We got in early (not long after they opened at 10am) & I would advise you do this to miss the massive crowds that line up outside in the cold.There are many rooms to visit & the big ticket items (dinosaurs) are on the ground floor, but make sure you make your way upstairs to the other rooms/exhibits. This museum is free which makes it even better, especially when you are trying to escape the cold! ",Dated museum
"January 4, 2020",People often rave about this museum but it tends to leave me a little cold.  The displays are very dated and the layout of the museum leaves you feeling it is cluttered.  Disappointed that the Wildlife Photography exhibition was so expensive (and not free).  ,Interesting day out.
"January 1, 2020","It's rare to find something cheap to do in London with kids, how about free! It's free entrance to the museum however, some exhibitions may have a fee. Loads to see and do around the museum.  Plenty of eating places. You can take your own lunch and have it in the picnic area.",Natural History Museum winter fun
"January 6, 2020","We visited the Natural History Museum after seeing the Victoria & Albert Museum across the street. There was over 1+ hour wait to go ice skating at their rink located on the side of the building. Despite the wait, the crowds gathering were in a festive holiday mood and the atmosphere was great! After ice skating, we went inside the museum and saw the oceans and space collections, among other things. The addition of the ice skating rink made this museum worth visiting - not sure I'd return again any other time of the year.",Dated museum

The exhibits are fascinating and so varied, plus there is plenty for younger visitors too. It is easy to spend hours wandering around the museum and as entry is free (recommended donation only) it is brilliant value and a must-visit attraction for those in the city.I don't doubt that I will be back again in the future!",Great free visit
"July 27, 2021",As we visited during Covid restrictions we had pre-booked a time to visit to ensure we could get in. Although we have visited London many times we had never been to this museum and thought it was time we did especially after seeing TV programmes about it.The building is a beautiful setting for these exhibits. The blue whale is the most impressive display and the one most people will remember although the dinosaurs are a favourite with most children and the part they want to see. The museum is divided into different coloured sections to help you navigate your way around. Personally I was not so interested in the rock displays but appreciated the way they had been displayed.During our visit we went to one on the cafe areas. It was nice and open and clean but the as with many places with a captive audience prices tend to be priced higher than any local cafes for a similar standard of food.,Amazing collection
"March 20, 2020","All I can say same thing: This is one of a number of brilliant museums in London, and one of the best I have visited anywhere.  It is free to enter, but donations are encouraged and gratefully received.  It has some amazing collections and exhibitions covering most aspects of life on earth and its history.  They provide the general public of all ages with a very stimulating and thought provoking educational experience.  It is housed in a beautiful old building with generous spaces and elaborate architecture.  Enjoy the special shows, such as the Wildlife photographer of the year exhibition (for a fee), and replenish afterwards in their pleasant coffee shop cum buffet restaurant.copy.",IF I WAS YOU I SHOULDN´T  GO TO THE RESTAURANT
"April 11, 2020",I went with a group of teenagers to London for five days. One day i went to this museum and i had a bad experience because the restaurant was too expensive and the quality of the food was so terrible. After five hours i started to throw up all the food. And the museum was like a cathedral because in there i was very cold. I got the flu and i went to Harrods and i throw up in the expensive bathrooms for rich people. I don´t study biology and i don´t like minerals... so it wasn´t interesting for me. So in conclusion i don´t recommend this museum because is a raste of money and you can buy something more useful in other spots of the city.,Too busy
"March 14, 2022","I haven't been to the museum since I was a teenager in the 80's & really wanted to have a great day out with my kids (between 10 & 23!).However......We had pre-booked tickets (free) which is just as well as there was a sign stating walk ups not available (it was term time I think in London). We still had to queue.Once inside it was in a word, heaving!!The blue whale in the main hall is OK, but not as good as 'Dippy'. Talking of dinosaurs, we headed there first. You are herded through a one way system where the displays are either above you or difficult to read. Full of school groups.We then headed to get an early lunch at the adjacent cafe. We were lucky to get a table straightaway and the food was OK.I can't really remember what else we saw but it was all busy, busy, busy and hardly a mask in sight (yes, I know restrictions have lifted but......).Best bit that I do remember was the Volcano and Earthquake bit, but we got there towards the end of the day and everyone was tired.Not sure I'd want to visit again any time soon. Such a shame.",A Fantastic FREE Museum
"February 13, 2020","Aside from the British Museum, this was on my ‘must do’ list while in London sightseeing. I certainly wasn’t disappointed. The range of artefacts is bewildering. The staff again should get a special mention as they are polite and helpful. The building has a fantastic front aspect and the additional rooms marry perfectly with the grand old structure. The staircase in the main hall was superb and looks not too dissimilar to Harry Potter Hogwarts, which I’d guess they’d come here for inspiration. The museum is nicely divided up for the myriad of natural categories. There are a few areas, such as the preserved specimens in jars, which I came across by accident around the garden and at the back of the building (I think). As with any museum, it is always best to plan your visit to get the most out of a fantastic experience. Use a map and the internet to highlight your ‘must sees’. Don’t forget to donate at the museum as free entry is great, but we need to support these excellent establishments. I had a really healthy lunch while there consisting of chicken, potato salad with broccoli & bean sprouts for lunch with was fresh, tasty and good value for money.","Fantastic, but make sure you book in advance"
"April 9, 2022","This place is a great, fun-filled & educational day out for all the family. Plenty to do & see, & particularly impressive given that it's a free entry! I've always enjoyed visiting, my most recent visit with my 8 year old daughter was enjoyable for the both of us.It's worth noting that you can't just rock up without a ticket if you expect to gain admission. Until now that's always what we've done, so I was surprrised upon arrival that we were not able to gain entry to the museum without a pre-booked ticket (still free, just a bit more of a faff). Luckily I was able to jump straight on my phone & get a couple of tickets for entry a few hours later - & filled that time by grabbing lunch & nosing around Harrods. Just be aware if you haven't visit since befor the pandemic that you may need to be a bit more organised than in previous years!",Probably best on a quiet day
"August 3, 2021","My husband, teenage daughter and I visited yesterday and like other reviewers said there is lots to see and also quite narrow places at times and as it's low cost to get in there were lots of young children who are not necessarily stopping to read all the information and as a result there were times when it was very crowded and difficult to keep any distance from others. There were lots of signs to wear masks but many adults weren't and based on the high volume of people I'd guess they weren't all exempt and this was disappointing as it made for a very uncomfortable experience. Overall it would have been better having less people there and spread out so restrictions on the number of people in each area.",Favourite museum in London
"April 5, 2022","I love the Natural History Museum; so pleased that it’s free entry. Exhibitions are great and informative, there is something for everyone here. Over the years they’ve spent a lot on renovation and expansion but they’ve kept the core exhibits like the fossils/dinosaurs, mammals etc. The wildlife photographer of the year (paid) exhibit is worth going to. Recommend booking a ticket online, no matter what day or time of the week it is busy with yours or school trips. Still love this place though.",Great visit
"August 3, 2021","Was with three under 10’s who was amazed with the museum, we could have spent a week there as there is a huge amounts to see.  If you are a member or patron there is even more to see.  Great for large groups too.  Lifts are available to get other floors.  Places to eat and drink with toilet facilities in two zones.  Museum shops have an array of minerals/ gems and many other items to buy, the gem stones we found are very reasonably priced.  Plenty of staff around if you get lost or need assistance and all are super friendly. Loved the day there and the family too.",Nice Museum - VERY busy
"January 4, 2020","We went as a family to this museum. It was early July, and even though we expected it to be busy, as all the main museums are free, what we experienced was something else. The museum was so busy it was hard to enjoy anything. You had to keep going at all times, otherwise you would get stampeded by people behind you. The museum is beautiful in that there are lots of places and things to explore, however I can't get over how crowded it was.",Nice Day Out In London 
"August 15, 2020","I haven’t been here since I was a child and a friend and I decided to meet here as it’s a great location and I wanted to revisit some exhibits. Due to covid you have to book a free ticket which honestly is a great idea, there was virtually no queues and we got in hassle free. The staff were all really nice and all wearing protective gear. The museum is clearly marked and the sections are easy to follow which made this whole trip unproblematic as we felt very safe. Some of the more interactive exhibits were not open but the dinosaurs and other core parts were open for viewing. A great place to spend a few hours.",Fab day out but bring a packed lunch!
"August 18, 2022","A great day out! Some fantastic exhibits (it was great to see Dippy the Dinosaur back in the museum!) and so much to see. Was quite warm in some parts (partly because it’s an old building, and partly because it was so busy)Despite being very busy, we were able to see everything we wanted to. We spent 4.5 hrs there and it flew by. If we wanted to read and see everything we would probably want to go twice, we were shattered after the time we had been there so we’re very happy with what we had seen but you could spend so many more hours there immersed in different parts of history. Would recommend this as a place to visit for all ages.  We didn’t visit the garden as it was chucking it down with rain so hopefully will see that next time we go but I hear that’s beautiful and there’s lots to see and learn about.Only criticism we would have would be the price of the food in there so id recommend bringing your own packed lunch or going after you’ve had lunch. We paid £15 for two cans of Coke and two cheese and tomato sandwiches. But considering it’s a free attraction, still a cheap day out. I am sure the profit from the food adds to the donations they receive that keep it running and fund the amazing research they do there.",Museum great but magic memories not so
"September 23, 2021","The museum was great, our son loves watching Andy on CBeebies so this was a really exciting trip, we had our photo taken by magic memories, in fairness the photos were good so we chose to buy one which wasn’t cheap £10.. and also paid extra to view the photos online which they said would be emailed to us within 24 hours. Today I received a link to access the photos which is wanting me to pay an extra £7 to “view” each photo online, that’s a slight con since we’ve already paid for this when we purchased our printed photo.. £49 to view 7 photos online is daylight robbery. Ive emailed magic memories and await their response but please be warned.",Great Museum 
"January 21, 2020",We wanted to do something different so decided to visit the natural history museum. The entrance is breath taking and for me the best part of the museum. The building itself is stunning. We did not realise how big the place was and only was able to spend 1 hour here. I would most definitely return and next time with the children as it would be a great day out. A token donation is well worth the experience and I would highly recommend.,Far too busy
"August 5, 2022","We booked on line as requested but there is no point. No checks made and no queue (despite it being about midday) they just let everyone in. Consequently, the museum was far too crowded. It was like being on a conveyer belt of people in many areas, not just the dinosaurs. We just all shuffled along together. The whole museum was overly busy and hence unpleasant.It is also very hot. Whilst this is down to the weather and the museum did have a few large fans around, it is not helped by the cheapest drink being £2.50!The idea of booking a time slot to avoid the infamous queues is an excellent idea and one I hope the museum continues with, but the museum needs to check these bookings and limit numbers to a more reasonable amount.",Entertainment for everybody.
"February 2, 2020","This is my favorite museum in London. The vastness of different exhibitions will suit interest of every visitor, and above everything else, the building itself is a beautiful wonder. Tip for those who are planning to visit, go there as early as possible, as it is getting quite crowded closer to lunchtime.",Favourite! 
"January 1, 2020",One of my favourite museums in London. This was my second visit and first time for my 6yr old. He loved looking around and enjoyed the interactive exhibits. Only negative was that it was really crowded when we visited so it took longer to get around. Would definitely recommend a visit here.,Not an amazing museum but something to do while in London I guess
"July 19, 2021","Honestly, I was expecting a little more from the National History Museum. There just didn't seem to be much to see and given the size of the building I was surprised. The animal and dinosaur section is probably the most interesting but given the size of the building I felt like there should be more to see, especially when a huge section of the museum was dedicated to rocks which I'm sure some people loved but it just seemed odd. I've been to other ""National"" museums and they've been a lot more interesting but luckily it was free so really can't be too angry about it. Stop by if you have a spare 2 hours but I wouldn't go out of your way to fit this in.","Beautiful setting, but far too crowded to enjoy it."
"August 13, 2022","The NHM is a beautiful building with so much amazing history. The entrance hall is simply breathtaking. It is also wonderful that there is no entry fee, so that everyone is able to visit the museum and it’s exhibits. However, this presents a problem…far too many people are being allowed entry to the museum. We pre-booked our tickets as we assumed that there would be a cap on how many visitors would be allowed into the museum at one time. This is could not be further from the truth and it was completely unnecessary as anyone can walk in at any time and we felt like sardines in a tin continuously throughout our visit. It feels like cattle being herded through the exhibits and it doesn’t leave any space for you to explore freely or read any of the information. We visited on a warm day, and the heat was stifling. Although this isn’t something that can be helped in such an old building, less bodies might be a good place to start. We had also pre-booked Dippy, again, a completely pointless exercise as everyone was just allowed to crowd into the room at the same time, and then you can barely see any of Dippy.The cafe is extortionate, £9 for a basic cheese & tomato sandwich, can of Diet Coke & some crisps is simply a rip off. Overall the visit was ok…but I don’t think we’ll be rushing back.","Dino Snores for kids , NOT worth the money"
"January 3, 2022","We visited Dino snores for kids event in decemeber.  We paid around £60 per peron including tickets but the activities done during dino snores were really disappointing. Event was crowded and chaotic.Gates open at 6.30pm but by the time we went in it was nearly 7.45pm, there were only 3 staff to check 100's of guests.Except T-shirt making other activities were not really interesting to kids who had been to these museums many times but were attending dinosnore for first time.You can do most of these activites during day time in the museum for free, sleeping experience wasn't nice.There were 4 activities in total, three in the night and one in the morning which you do on your own.1. Visiting Fantastic beasts portraits around the museum with an activity sheet.2. Making Dinosaur tshirt (you use a coloring pen to draw on a white T-shirt).3. Night trail, we expected more from this, you just go around the museum to find a name about a dinosaur and the instructor was bit boring , it was late, many kids fell asleep.3.  In morning, you will get another activity sheet which you do on your own.Sleeping-Sleeping experience wasn't great, they give you thin mats. There was social distancing here.  Breakfast was not great , one pastry and orange juice , there was no fruit inside our bag.I was intrigued as to why it is booked out but couldn't find any decent review , after reading this I hope you make your decision wisely.Overall it's not worth the money. DO IT during day time for free","Amazing as ever , with a new icon"
"August 21, 2022","I have been here several times , but this is the 1st time since they moved dippy out of the main hall , and brought in Hope the blue whale . Everybodies reaction to the impact of stepping into the main hall , is one of awe and amazement .  I didn't miss Dippy , especially as it is back for a limited time in a near by hall . I strongly advise pre booking for free for both Dippy and entry to the museum , as it is a long queue to get in ",Definitely worth a visit!
"February 23, 2020","We had a brilliant day at the natural history museum and couldn’t believe how great it is given that entry is free! The exhibits are interesting and varied and our children aged 6 and 4 really enjoyed it! Our children were blown away by seeing Andy’s clock and the staircase from CBeebies Andy’s Dinosaur Adventures! The dinosaur hall was naturally and as to be expected, very busy. It could do with being a bigger space so you can view and read the exhibits better without feeling rushed because you’re being pushed around by the crowd or getting in someone’s way. The route round the dinosaur hall is narrow in parts given the amount of people there so you just get pushed along by the flow! However don’t let this put you off, it’s definitely worth it! There is so much to see and do in the museum and the escalator to the volcanoes and earthquake hall is very exciting! There are plenty of cafes and restaurants spread out around the museum with lovely food and refreshments which is great as it means it’s easy to stop for food or drinks at several points during the visit and it spreads the rush for lunch around the museum rather than everyone trying to get food all in the same place. It’s an absolutely brilliant day out, we were super impressed, all enjoyed it and will definitely return next time we visit London.",Fantastic! 
"July 4, 2021",Last minute decision to visit as we arrived in London earlier than expected. So very glad we went. The whole museum is so well thought out and the descriptions and explanations of exhibits are all well done. Staff so helpful. Personally I thought the price of £16.10 per adult was excessive for the wildlife photography exhibition and so we didn't do it but I know the museum needs to make back huge sums of money lost during the pandemic. Liked the idea of the donation stands at the end and being contactless very practical. Recommend to anyone and everyone.,Day out
"April 13, 2022",Fantastic place to visit all of the exhibit areas are very good but if you want to see the dinosaurs- who doesn’t get there early queues were very very long and inside the exhibit it was rammed no control on how many could enter at a time bit like playing sardines. Although free entry you do have to book a time slot have to say way way to many people being allowed in today it does detract from the enjoyment when it’s as packed as it was today. Gift shops also very busy gifts not cheap but then it’s London and I have to say not as much choice as I expected. Managed to get seated in the cafe area but restaurant again packed.All staff were very polite and helpful. Definitely recommend as a fab day out if you don’t have children try term time when it’s maybe not so busy.,Some bits were excellent
"August 22, 2021","I’m a history teacher, so you would think that I would love this place. However, I found some of the displays a bit dated, especially where there was the stuffed mammals.  On the other hand, some parts of the museum were exceptional. Hintze Hall and the giant whale skeleton are a must see. We also loved the collections of gems, minerals and precious stones. We had pre-booked but they were accepting walk-ins too. I did feel that some areas were too crowded and it made it difficult to see some things. The T-Rex skull needs better lighting in the area that follows a timeline. The dinosaur exhibit area was very crowded and dark but it was amazing to see such a large collection.The museum is free but there is a suggested donation of £5, if you want to contribute. We didn’t pay for any of the special exhibits. Maps cost £1 and I really think you need one. There quite a few shops dotted around the museum. Toilets were a little harder to find, even with the map.",Dino Snores - Amazing experience
"January 12, 2022","A small group of us went to the NHM for an adult DinoSnores event - it was amazing and would recommend to others.The event starts around 6.30pm and you leave by 9.30am, during the event there is a 3 course meal, quizzes, talks, films, pop up bar and breakfast.Some of the exhibitions are open including the Dinosaurs and Wildlife Photographer of the year .For the whole event there are up to 300 people, which means that as you go around there is so much space to view things (only about 10 people in the Photography exhibition).A yoga mat is provided, you bring your own sleeping bag and get to sleep under Hope the Whale (although don't expect much sleep!)There were plenty of staff on duty to help find your way around (and serve drinks)A fabulous experience, one I feel quite privileged to have been able to attend.",Day out

"August 21, 2020",We visited post COVID as we were in London to see family.  I was a little apprehensive about visiting at this time.  However tickets were limited and had to pre booked ( essential).  This meant that visitors numbers were limited but gave everyone inside much more space.  There is one way in via a side entrance which is clearly marked from the tube by way floor stickers.  Staff outside were on hand to direct and ensure you did not miss your timed entry.Once inside there was plenty of hand sanitizer spread throughout the attraction.  Food inside was limited but understable.  Every where clean.  As ever the museum never fails to amaze.  Last visit was approx 13 years ago when I lived in London.  We travelled as 2 adults and 1 12 year old.  Highly recommend.,"Too crowded, feel like you're always in someone's way"
"August 29, 2022","I feel a little bad giving it three stars given all of the hard work they do behind the scenes (and how helpful the staff are) but as an overall experience it's quite mediocre.You can't argue with the price (though a donation is always a good idea) but it's quite an uncomfortable experience. It's extremely busy, even on a Sunday, and you always feel like you're in someone's way. Around certain exhibits (e.g. the dinosaur section) it feels more like you're in a flowing river of people rather than a museum you can genuinely engage with.I would advise turning up an hour before they close because it thins out quite a bit then and you can walk straight in and focus on the things you really want to see (like the dinosaur or the whale). I would advise skipping the weaker exhibitions because you aren't going to see anything special (endless numbers of fossils and rocks mostly).Take a bottle and fill up from their water, too. The selection of drinks to buy is quite poor.",A Good Time
"July 5, 2022","I thought this was a fantastic museum given that it was free. It had a nice mixture of exhibits about a variety of topics - weather, planets, gems and more. I think this is more geared towards families, so if you are expecting a quiet museum experience, please know there were a lot of screaming and children running around. I highly recommend visiting Dippy and the gems, as those collections were quite unique. I also would note that I was impressed with how handicap accessible this museum was compared to many others in London. I don't think I would recommend more than two or so hours unless you have children - then a full half day may be warranted.","Overcrowded, too hot, badly laid out and not worth visiting"
"October 30, 2022","What a nightmare outing! Please don’t go unless you’re happy to be roasted alive because of the awful heat, crushed half to death in overcrowded small spaces or suffocated through lack of fresh air. There’s plenty of better museums around the UK that are less crowded, better laid out and with more interesting, interactive exhibits.  The NHM is feeling dated and amateur compared to other museums we’ve visited.We took the grandchildren after having happy memories of at least 3-4 visits when our own children were young.  It used to be a fabulous destination, but something has gone very wrong. To say the museum has gone downhill is an understatement.  It was dreadfully overcrowded, despite us booking timed tickets in advance. It was virtually impossible to view exhibits, made worse by most attractions being in too small areas on one floor, with crowds of people being funnelled through fairly narrow corridors to get to each zone.It’s free to get in, but there are annoying staff at the entrance shouting at everyone to pay a £5 donation for each person on entry. If it was worth it, I’d be happy to donate, but it wasn’t even worth the train fares getting there.We gave up battling the crowds and left after less than 2 hours.  One child was feeling very sick and ill (close to fainting) and the rest of us were seriously overheated and uncomfortable.  We didn’t stop to queue in the overcrowded cafes, nor bother to spend money in the overpriced shops, although we had initially planned to.  The management need to get a serious grip on the situation. We were so disappointed and definitely won’t be back. It’s such a shame that such a beautiful museum has deteriorated so badly, mostly it seems due to poor planning. It would attract far more income from the public if they sorted it out.",The Best museum in the world
"January 23, 2021","If the collection didn't impress you, the building sure will. This is where you can combine your love for nature, science, history and architecture. This magnificent building that looks like a cathedral/palace, has millions of objects that are million year old. From most famous T-Rex, rare animals/birds to some exotic plants whose tiles decorate the museum's ceilings, this is one place that I can never get tired of.We should all be thankful to the father of dinosaurs Sir Richard Owen who wanted the building large enough to display the skeleton of the largest animal on earth, The Blue Whale.And we should also thank him for scrapping the entry fee because in olden times, these super world class attractions were only for the super rich but he wanted everyone to have access and enjoy the natural world.What a nice gesture.",They just want your money!
"June 22, 2021",So my partner and I were going back home and we did not have anywhere to keep our suitcases. When we arrived at the museum (already with our tickets) we were advised that we needed to leave our bags at the cloakroom. Imagine our surprised when a guy there told us that we needed to pay 21£ in order to be able to visit the museum without our suitcases. We said that we were not going to pay and that we would carry our visit with our bags and we were neglected from that choice. So basically they don’t care about you they just care about your money. I did not have the chance to visit the museum and even if I had I would never donate (if they are just like this with bags imagine what they would use your money to).,Never fails to amaze
"January 16, 2022","A firm favourite with tourists or for those who wish to visit this brilliant museum. It is free to enter, but it is worth booking a time slot online as those with time slots get in quicker than those without. Once inside you can purchase a map for £1 which helps you navigate around. There is a lot to see, it is not all about dinosaurs and blue whales! Usual facilities are available onsite and friendly staff are on hand to help if required.",Please charge an admission!
"January 6, 2020","It would seem that most parents here think this is some kind of crèche, letting their children run riot. Just because it is a free space, shouldn’t mean you can let your kids run around shouting. I could only bare to spend an hour hear. Every time I went to read a info board, I couldn’t concentrate due to some of the children around me. I think a small charge, would at least eradicate this problem and if parents were actually paying for something, they might feel their kids should actually be looking at the exhibits. Rant over.",My Favourite Museum
"June 13, 2021","I love this place. I hadn't been for years so when we visited London with some friends we kept one morning free to revisit. It was an absolute joy. The staff are great, every room of this massive museum is stuffed full of great exhibits and superbly presented information and it's free to get in. Amazing. My best experience of 2021 so far. I cannot wait to come back soon.",A Must to Visit!
"March 19, 2020","From the beautiful renovations to the outside of the building to the carefully laid out exhibits the museum makes for a great day out. While we were there there were a number of school parties on a day trip to the museum. They were just mesmerised by the scope of the natural world. Cannot do it justice in one day, there is just too much to see so be selective about where you visit. It has the added advantage that it is free.l",very good and educational
"January 5, 2020",It's free to visit but a donation should be made to help with running costs. So much to see you could spend a full day in there.Big que to get In but well worth the wait in my opinion,Amazing place for children and family!
"November 8, 2022","Simply stunning architecture sets the stage for one of the best museums in the world.I was very pleased to see that Dippy was back in pride of place and I enjoyed the exhibit on earthquakes and volcanoes.I recommend you, it is better to go in the morning when it opens or else there will be many children in the dinosaur exhibition.A great day. 👍🏻",Was in awe of the beauty and magnificence of this museum.
"January 19, 2020","A visit I’ve wanted to make for many years, and was not disappointed. Got to the museum mid morning on a Saturday and walked straight in, but was busy with families excited to see the dinosaurs. Loads to see and very informative and fascinating. Spent several hours wandering around, when we came out about 1.30-2 there was a long queue to enter, stressful if you’ve children, so get in early.",Quite disappointing really
"November 25, 2021","I don't really know what I was expecting, having not been to the NHM since I was a child, but the experience left me somewhat underwhelmed. Yes it's free, I get that, but the experience wasn't what I expected. We are a family of 4 of us (2 adults, 2 kids aged 6 and 9). One of the main issues was just how busy it was. It was absolutely heaving, to the point where I felt uncomfortable, espcecially with the potential to catch coronavirus as so many people weren't wearing masks. This together with the fact it was so hot inside (due to only having fans and no air con), made it a very uncomfortable experience. We were all glad to exit to get some fresh air by the end. One of the issues I have is that despite booking a time slot, it was very obvious that they let anyone in at any time and didn't even look at the booked time. This is why it is so busy. Absolutely pointless booking a time slot! The exhibits were OK, although the map was a bit confusing and didn't explain what was where in each room, so we ended up going up and down the stairs frequently to find specific things.  ",Festive ice skating visit
"November 15, 2021","Have visited the museum a number to times over the years but this was the first time we'd been for ice skating. We'd booked online so had a slot, all very organised, a little bit of queuing but moved quickly. It was pretty busy but it was 5pm on a Saturday so to be expected. I looks beautiful as night falls with the building lit, fairy lights everywhere and a Christmas tree in the centre of the rink. The ice was in good conditions, the little ones can hire the penguins (£6 extra charge). Plenty of staff on the ice to help. There's a carousel, stalls with sweets and a cafe for hot drinks etc. You get 50 mins skating time which is plenty. It's worth a visit as I think this will be the last year the NHM will have a rink.",Visit it for sure!
"January 7, 2020",I visited the museum with my two kids and adore it. The exhibitions inside are amazing especially the dinosaur and zoo area. The blue whale skeleton is amazing and also like that they have a lot of dinosaur skeleton hanging from ceiling. Visit it especially with kids they have a lot to learn. The entrance is free and that's why the museum is too crown from the very morning but if you' re patience you gonna see everything. There is also a shop in the museum and another one close to dinosaur section especially for kids who love dinos!,Average. Not as good during COVID
"August 23, 2020","We came on a flying visit to London and have never managed to brave the queues, so COVID advanced bookings seemed like a great time to book.Booking was free, easy and we arrived in advance as requested to hardly any queues. I couldn't fault the accessibility of hygiene and hand sanitizer.A lot of the exhibits which were interactive were closed, and to ensure social distancing, any exhibits which can't offer a one-way system were also closed off, which included some of the aerial dinosaur walks which get you closer to the skeletons. This was a shame.It was enjoyable, but we hsipped through really quickly and didn't really pause for long at the exhibits. We live in Cardiff and we're surprised that the National Museum there had better exhibits.Good for a quick visit, hard to fault when it's free, but not as engaging as we had hoped and an hour and. A half was plenty for a wonder round. Wouldn't want to come here during COVID with young children who are not of reading age.Good for: a quick visit, adultsBad for: kids, kids who like interactivity, dinosaur fans. ",Not what it used to be
"October 31, 2021","When I visited this museum as a child and then with our children the exhibits were accessible and could be clearly seen and understood.  How disappointing to find returning with grandchildren that  most of the museum is in almost in  total darkness and that exhibits are remote , often hanging from the ceiling rather than at eye level  and with  information boards  often too small and detailed  to be read at a distance.  The mobile  T-Rex mock up was really the only stimulating item for young children.  This museum, has become too crowded, too adult and only really suitable for students, I do not recommend  a visit if you are accompanied by children as it  does not   have  a suitable level of prestation for  them.Too much razzmatazz and not enough thought for  the simple needs of young children. ",Needs air conditioning and better cafe
"June 11, 2021","The dinosaur part is particularly good as is the Earthquake/Volcano area.The rest is pretty much as I remember it as a kid which is fine.It was ridiculously hot in there. Didn’t appear they have air con or if they do it certainly wasn’t working. Pretty uncomfortable walking around in the heat, especially when we are required to wear masks (which I’m not against)The restaurant is a disgrace. The sandwiches were dry - barely buttered - and overpriced, the coffee although made barista style certainly didn’t taste it plus no Coke Zero? What place doesn’t sell the 3 Coke flavours? Far, far too expensive and the range of food very limited.",Always a great day out.
"September 23, 2021",Visited to particularly see the Amazing Beasts exhibition as my kids are big Harry Potter fans.   Really well presented and held their interest for ages.  The museum itself is always great and recommend just to get ahead of the queues and access to the Anning Rooms.,Photography exhibition
"January 2, 2020","Fantastic. I really think everyone should visit this exhibition. It’s really beautiful and really important. Go early as it gets a bit busy in there and there’s not enough room between the photographs so you need a quiet spot to see and read everything. It’s really brilliant though and worth the jostle. The photographers are amazing, and I’m always blown away by the finalists. So good.",Birthday - Day trip
"September 18, 2020","Architecture of the building is amazing,  we were both really looking forward to the visit,  prebooked timed ticket entry, staff very friendly and helpful, hand sanitiser points frequently positioned.Downside which resulted in us leaving earlier than we had planned,  too many mums with pre school children who seem to use it as a crèche,  some displays were very crowded as staff were just letting people in without checking space, and there was no social distancing in places.  Felt unsafe in the dinosaur and whale sections,  staff should have ensured appropriate numbers entered. Children running everywhere and too young to have or maintain any interest in the displays.  Such a shame as love this museum but won’t be back anytime soon!",A good day out but pre-book!
"October 28, 2023","We brought the children here during the summer holidays, so it was naturally very busy, with all the usual tourist traffic in addition to families.  Firstly, I need to point out that you cannot just walk up and go inside (which is how I remembered it). After fighting our way through London traffic and people, we were shocked to find two lines to enter the museum; people who had ""pre-booked"" and people who hadn't. So even though you don't need to actually pay to enter, you will want to pre-book a timeslot to avoid having to queue outside, for over an hour, in the pouring rain, just to get in.... What made it worse, was that when we finally made it to the end of the queue, we were seemingly just waved through without any checks at all.To top it off, once we entered the building, we were met by a sinister looking gauntlet of card machines that we needed to run in order to actually make it into the entrance lobby. With the huge number of machines creating a bottleneck of people trying to get in, it felt like we were almost climbing over the machines just to get past. It was flanked by several members of staff who were also encouraging us to donate. I get they need income, but after queueing outside for an hour just to get in, it felt a bit dirty.This was my first time here since the removal of Dippy. I remembered it being a place packed with wonder and all manner of historical artifacts and on that score it did not disappoint. Needless to say, it was extremely busy, so expect the usual at these types of events; queues to use the toilet, people pushing and shoving, long queues to order food and then no tables to sit at. For us it was an exhausting day.We did pay for an extra set of photos with the children with the dinosaurs in the back ground (green screen type setup). It cost us £20 for a full set of three physical photos, keyring and fridge magnet, as well as digital access to all photos. We considered this pretty good value.So overall, it is an excellent source of information and education about the natural history of our world, for adults and kids alike. Definitely plan to spend the entire day here as it's a large museum and you will likely spend the day packed into the middle of a large herd very slowly moving through the museum.",Trip
"April 7, 2023","Went in the morning we got there earlier than anticipated but we were still allowed in before hand so that was good. There was a big line for those who didn’t already book so definitely make sure to book before hand. It’s super close to the underground station so that’s handy and there’s a lot of museums close together so you can’t really get bored. There’s somewhere that will take your bags and coats if you pay, however it does cost £ so if you won’t want to pay make sure your bag is light. In some areas it does get packed but overall because of the size it isn’t too bad. The food is really good for the price and was very quick considering how busy it was. Found it really nice that there was people who worked there going through some extra information and even had fossils we were able to hold. If you want to do it all in one day you definitely need to be there for opening as there just so much to see. They have a really nice gift shop that has Jurassic Park merchandise which were all reasonably priced. The toilets were cleaned. There is plenty of space for wheelchairs when going around as well that was good.",Spectacular tour of the NHM!
"January 5, 2020","My daughter and I did a Private Guided Tour of the Natural History Museum. We really enjoyed the morning with our tour guide Craig. He showed us many of the museum's treasures and explained in detail why they were relevant. The crowds were massive that day (December 28), especially in the dinosaur area, so we greatly appreciated Craig guiding us from exhibit to exhibit. The museum is so beautiful and I look forward to seeing it again. I highly recommend this tour and Craig!",Wear Comfortable Shoes!
"November 1, 2021","Had a great couple of hours here & really enjoyed seeing the dinosaurs & mammals - everything was so cleverly presented & all seemed so real!The building itself is absolutely beautiful, inside & out - by far the prettiest of all the museums in London.Make sure you wear comfortable shoes as the building is huge & there are are lots of steps to negotiate! There were lots of people there when we visited, but then it was half term week. I was charged £3 just to hang up my coat in the cloakroom, so that was my donation as I thought that was an excessive charge.",Beautiful building
"January 7, 2020","The best thing about it is the building itself.. An absolutely stunning piece of architecture. There is a surprising number of things to do as well as just look at stuffed animals, insects and dinosaur bones. There is a large interactive display about human senses which is very interesting and great for kids of all ages. A museum like this really should get 5 stars but I've knocked 1 off as it gets so busy.. I walked past it on January 3 and there was a 1 hour wait to get in. The day I went was not so bad but even so it was rammed. Try and go during term time, lots of schools do trips there but it is still quieter than the holidays.","Lots to see, really awesome"
"May 9, 2022","Very fun to go to and a lot of things to see. The top floor with volcanoes and begining of the earth has small experiments and things that show you what is meant with the explanation. Very big escalator to the top of the building is also very nice. Make sure to go during the week or it'll be very very busy on Saturday. I went on a Friday afternoon and could walk around in peace. I recommend having some sort of plan how to go through the museum if you want to see everything, because it's really big. Staff was very friendly, some parts were closed or the specific item was somewhere else at the time I was there, but most of it was really nice to see.",Birthday visit 
"October 26, 2020","Great places, a lot to explore, the staff were nice. COVID 19 safety procedures were great.The only thing we were left standing in the rain & cold for half an hour pass our booking time as there were to many people in the museum, I suggest maybe doing a wristband system so everyone gets a fair chance to lot around the museum and unfortunately a lot of bits were closed of but that’s understandable with the current situation. ",Tired and dated
"August 19, 2021","I have been visiting here every few years for nearly 4 decades and other than temporary exhibitions it has not really been updated. The exhibits are tired, and interactive elements are mainly broken or tatty, and the museum just does not offer a 21st century visitor experience. This is such a shame as the science and research carried out by their staff is rightly celebrated- but this is not apparent at all in the exhibits. Queuing for some time in a stuffy and crowded room to see an animatronic T Rex is neither surprising nor educational these days.",Natural History Museum - must see
"January 25, 2020","Visited the Natural History Museum in London, a natural history museum that exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history. It is one of three major museums on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, others being the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. There are many things to see for all ages from children to adults. Expect it to be very busy and packed as people bring their families for a day out here and the entrance is free. ",Dinosnores for Grown Ups
"January 10, 2022","Dinosnores for grownups was a truly excellent event.  We could camp anywhere in the massive Hintze Hall, including upstairs in the galleries, so there was plenty of space for all participants.  The event was run in a very covid-secure way and felt well-organised.  The ticket price included all activities, a drink on arrival, tea and coffee, a really good quality three-course meal and a hearty breakfast to send us on our way.  We were spoilt for choice with the activities, with particular highlights being meeting geckos, spiders and snakes up close, crafting and pub quizzes.  I was pleasantly surprised that we could roam around many of the galleries and exhibits as well.  No wonder we didn’t bother turning in before the lights were dimmed at 3am!",Heartless members of staff
"February 16, 2022","We saved up to take our 3 & 4 year old on their first trip to London which takes 3 hours door to door. When we arrived, they wouldn’t let us in and said we had to pre-book a ticket in advance - despite the museum being free. In my 40 years of visiting the museum I have never had to do this!! The staff on the gate were absolutely heartless, I explained our situation and they still flat out refused. The children were devastated. Appalling behaviour and a waste of money for us as a family.",Fantastic and free London attraction
"April 11, 2020","A fantastic, free and iconic London attraction with something for everyone. We visited with friends (a family with three children under 12) who were staying with us in London. The museum is huge! You could easily spend a whole day here exploring the various exhibitions and learning. So much to see and do. Will hopefully return at some stage and spend some more time. Highly recommend.",Brilliant FREE day out but please donate if you can!!
"August 30, 2021","From the outside the building is very impressive. And on the inside it is even more so! We booked online tickets for 10am and headed straight to the dinosaurs. We explored the museum for 3 hours and could have much easily stayed longer but my youngest didn’t want to stop and actually read anything, he just wanted to flit around and quickly look at each exhibit. Yes it was busy but not over crowded - we were still able to see everything we wanted at our own pace. The museum relies on donations so in theory, the more people they let in per day, the more donations they will receive. So I’m happy it was busy, it would be more worrying if it was not! If you’re concerned about covid then wear a face mask and pack your own sanitiser. All staff members wore masks and were very helpful and hands on when approached. Excellent free day out but please donate if you can!",You'll need more than one day
"January 10, 2020","We visited on a weekday to avoid the crowds and were very pleased we did. Even early on a Monday it was filling up quickly so we went straight into the Dino section as that was our must-see. It was amazing! So much so we almost missed our train home.Definitely allow a very long day, or two, if you want to make the most of this incredible museum.",Well-organized and varied exhibits
"December 14, 2022","This was such a wonderful museum! I really enjoyed the organization of the exhibits and it was free (!!) It was so wild to be able to visit such a great museum for free. They do have an area to tap your credit card to donate, which I recommend so that this museum can be around forever. We were fortunate to be visiting the museum when they had dippy (the dinosaur) on display. There was so much information on the history of dinosaurs and all the fossils were amazing. I was also really impressed with their gem and mineral exhibit. It was so incredibly well organized and the display was set up well.",Overall amazing!
"December 3, 2021","Overall a really amazing experience. Spent 4 hours here! Definitely takes longer than you think and we didn’t even get to see all of it.The food in the Kitchen area was okay. While I was able to have some chicken, cabbage and wedges in the end, staff had very poor knowledge of catering for gluten free and there were very slim pickings. The food itself was ok - chicken was quite dry but not bad at all for £12.Unfortunately huge parts of the exhibits were missing sometimes, each room had multiple areas with signs about the exhibits being removed or under renovation. And in areas the lighting / interactive parts didn’t work or were out of order. However that didn’t sour our experience much at all and we had an amazing overall experience.","It Was Good, That"
"August 8, 2021","I very much enjoyed this trip to the Natural History Museum with my three pals. We hadn't booked tickets, but arrived at 10am to queue for about 10 minutes and then were released into the exhibits (we were overjoyed to find it was completely free!). First stop, the bogs. These were located at various points throughout the venue, which was a huge relief seeing as I was travelling with someone with a slightly weaker bladder. We then went to the Human Evolution section, which was really interesting. There were so many real-life skeletons and reconstructions of our distant relatives. We then went up to the Volcano and Earthquake section - best part was probably the earthquake simulator. We also enjoyed seeing the huge whale in the main hall and learning some more about the planets of our solar system. Another highlight was the gift shop as it provided lots of giggles.My biggest disappointment was the dinosaur section as I found it quite boring (apart from the big T Rex). Good for all the family, free and lots to see and do, which brings this museum's score to a 4 out of 5 on this occasion.",Magnificent building!!
"January 16, 2020","The Natural history museum is not only for children or nature scholars. The amazing building is worth the visit by itself, and remember that the entrance is free!Don't miss the blue whale skeleton in the main hall of the old building, the dinosaurs section, the huge moon replica, the red zone with the earthquake simulator, or the treasures in the top floor, with the moon stone or the first edition of Charles Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"".You can stay an entire day here, depending if you have kids interested in these subjects, or if you are an aficionado yourself.Enjoy!","In a word, 'WOW!'"
"February 17, 2020","Having visited the Natural History Museum in Oxford, this was a long-awaited visit for me, personally.The museum is enflesslely brilliant and interesting. As a FREE site, it is up there with the top things is recommend to visit.The Volancoes and Earthquakes section is truly fantastically executed with an earthquake simulator near the end of this area. We had an excellent level of dialogue between myself and my friend's nephew!The blue whale skeleton is absolutely breath-taking and really dominates any visit in a pleasent way.The dinosaur section is really well done, as well.This needs to be on the top of everyone's agenda when visiting London!",A hugh collection.
"March 17, 2020","In my travels I have come across nothing that compares to the Natural History Museum as a museum of the Natural World. The building is impresive in itself and is seen at it's best entering by the main entance hall where a real Blue Whale skeleton hangs from the ceiling. The mammals hall nearby contains a full size model of a blue whale among it's many excellent exhibits.Other good sections include Human Evolution, and a section for Fish Amphibians and Reptiles and Mammals.Down one of the corridors runs an impressive collection of Ichthyosaur and Plesiosaur (extinct reptile) fossils.And there are there are the dinosaurs. These include motorised moving models of dinosaurs. There is also some fossil skeletons of dinosaurs, this best of which in my opinion is Sophie the stegosaurus. What I think gives Sophie such class  is not her size, she probably was not full grown in death, but the fact the skeleton overwhelmingly comes from one fossil unlike most dinosaur skeletons which seems to be mostly made plaster replacing what is not found in the ground. Oddly Sophie is held away from the main Natural History Collection in the Geology Museum part of the collection.A good feature of the museum is that you are not obliged to pay an amount for visiting you pay what you think the visit was whorth. Which is useful if you do not have time to to have say a £20 whorth of visit.",I just  had to see Titanosaur .......
"October 28, 2023",".....the main purpose of my visit. A £16 exhibition fee but I had pre-booked a timed visit the night before and just strolled in, a short queue into the exhibit at midday but the museum seemed fairly quiet for a Saturday. The exhibit opened a fair few months ago so now you can queue up and pay to see this amazing exhibit. Since the pandemic pre-booking and timed visits seem the orderly way to go almost everywhere and takes the chance factor of getting in somewhere away, there's pro's and con's to that but I made it in and WOW.There are a few information screens to pass before getting to see Titanosaur but when you do it is an amazing moment, similar to when I first saw ' Dippy ' on School visit many years ago.Titanosaur is massive and amazingly 3 or 4 times the size of ' Dippy '. What made this visit unique was that you can actually touch the skeleton of this 100+million year old dinosaur. putting the palm of my hand on one of the thigh bones of Titanosaur was a magic, almost spiritual moment. We've all seen those DO NOT TOUCH signs but here you can. I had a bit of a wonder elsewhere on the ground floor, the ' Hintze ' hall is always a special place but Titanosaur stole the show today.",Interesting but far too busy. Needs restricted entry. 
"August 13, 2023","I hope the NHM takes on some of these reviews as constructive criticism.I love the NHM and I value highly that the UK provides free entry to museums. However, I do think the time has come for the NHM (and possibly V&A and British Museum) to started a ticketed entry system in order to reduce the number of visitors per day. It was far too busy. Not only the queue outside but once inside it was damn near impossible to see anything and explain things to the kids. People just see it as a tick list of places to visit and just crowd to take photos of things without even reading anything. Plus the heat in there!I feel the place needs a refresh. The dinosaur section has proved what can be achieved. If a section was closed to change exhibits and signage many would welcome it.  Doesn't need to be drastic, the plesiosaur wall will always be impressive, but the hyena and Panda look like they are 200yrs old. By all means continue to show taxidermy as it is historically interesting but a better comparison of new science would be welcome. The kids found it interesting. Aided by our knowledge of natural history more than the signs but they tired quickly due to the crowds and the heat. Only saw two sections before giving up as it was overwhelming for everyone. Sort out the crowds and this place will stay a gem. Currently the museums are turning into places to avoid. ",Uncomfortable
"April 17, 2022","We went in the Easter holidays on a Saturday. 2 adults, 3 children and 2 babies in a double stroller. We booked in advance The best experience we had there was the picnic area downstairs which we used as soon as we arrived as it was lunch time. We started out tour at the bugs and walked round ok was a bit crowded, we then got in the line to see the dinosaurs, it was a bit of a slow moving queue but we got in and I wish I never did! We had no time to look at anything as we had NO choice but to keep moving around and follow the path around I had 5 people step over my daughters legs in the stroller to get past even tho I was walking as fast as the flow let me! My children hated it and wanted to leave, they were getting pushed past by grown adults to see a trex they can see from behind them. I didn't blame them wanting to leave and we felt uncomfortable as them, so after an 1hr in the actual museum we left. But the picnic area was lovely 😅 dinosaur theme tables, highchairs there's toilets and baby changing down there definitely recommend taking your own food.",Sadly poor and exhausting!
"February 22, 2022","Very sad to be writing this but a family visit today was terrible!Staff were great but the crowds were horrific, the queues were unbelievable and while visit was stressful and exhausting.Queued for 30mins to get in for our booked time slot just to have non-ticket holders walk straight past and get in before us.Queued for 30mins or more to see the dinosaurs, just to be packed in like sardines, having to shuffle around with hundreds of others.The museum is fine but please explain to me what the point is of having a limited number or time slots to then just let anyone and everyone in.",Need a whole day to explore
"July 26, 2020","A remarkable museum. The displays were great with good signage and explanation provided. We tried exploring the whole museum but couldn't manage it in half a day. The main part which houses most of the displays were very busy while over in the Orange Zone which hosted the wildlife garden, spirit building, and Darwin centre was much quieter. Do pay attention to the building itself as sculptures of different plants and animals can be found everywhere from the columns to the ceiling. To top it all off, entry is free of charge. Will definitely return for a revisit if we're back in London.",Birthday Trip to Wildlife Photographer of the Year Exhibition
"February 17, 2020","The main purpose of our trip was to see the WPOTY exhibition as part of my Birthday celebrations. The galleries were well presented and it wasn't too crowded.We had limited time to see the rest of the museum, but know from previous experiences when the children were younger that there is something to appeal to everyone. Of course, the Cetaceans Hall is not-to-be-missed for the Blue Whale!","No control,  kids running riot. Masks under chins. Not a member of staff in sight. "
"July 7, 2021",This is our 2nd visit to this amazing museum but this time I feel we have been let down emmensley.Making your way around and there is no control over anything. People ignoring the one way system parents letting their kids run riot whilst there busy on the phone or talking away. People walking around with their masks hanging off there faces or under their chin. Nobody around to manage what is happening.We decided to visit the Central Cafe to get away from all the noise and unruly children. No wonder the museum is free because the prices you pay are extortionate. £6 for a baguette which is okay but no basic rolls all fancy. £2.30 for a can yes a can not even a bottle of coke. Bring you're own food and drinks.Why are they doing time slots when I know people were arriving at 10.30 with 11.30 appointments and are just let in.  No order no control a total shambles of an experience. ,Will keep you entertained for a few hours
"July 25, 2021","Visited the museum on a recent break to the City. Having been to London many times before, have never ventured as far as the museum. With Covid restrictions in place we did secure our free entry before turning up just in case numbers were high and we got turned away. Upon entry the iconic hallway is breathtaking with the Great Blue Whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling. The museum is broken down into colour co-ordinated areas so you can navigate and complete sections at a time. We did find some areas more interesting than others though it wasn't fully what I expected. We did visit the on-site cafe whilst at the museum for snacks and a drink. Prices were slightly expensive there but then I do appreciate its a captive market. Overall it was a pleasant place to visit for a few hours however now I've done it once I wouldn't rush back to return. ",Stunning Museum
"August 27, 2020","The family and I visited as one of our many points of interest during our 4 night visit to the capital. Set in the rather boho area of South Kensington, the museum is literally a 5 minute walk from the tube station (Circle, District and Piccadilly lines).An incredible piece of architecture containing some magnificent sights and artifacts, this a place that will keep both young and old engaged and fascinated. Be prepared to use shanks pony though as this place is absolutely huge with so much to see, my feet were in bits at the end of the day. Plenty of local amenities in the surrounding area, parks coffee houses, shops, restaurants and places to rest the legs.Definitely worth a visit.","Some great collections, but design and flow could be better"
"April 2, 2023","Above all, the building inside and out is gorgeous and it’s worth the visit for that alone.  The staff is friendly and the booking process was easy.  The collections of minerals, rocks, and elements as well as the sea creatures I found to be very interesting.  Most of the blue zone and the mammal exhibits feel quite old and physically outdated, including the rooms themselves, even if the information is still accurate.  Stained ceiling tiles and bleak hallways complete the image.  Ultimately it was a positive experience for me but I highly recommend avoiding going on the weekend unless you’re absolutely desperate to go.  I understand more people through the door = more potential donations but the least enjoyable part of the experience is just how incredibly crowded it is.  It would greatly improve the ability to experience the collections if they allowed just 10% less people inside at a time.  Currently you wade through rows and rows of people in tight areas to even get a chance to see something.  There is no organization or flow and thus there are groups moving in both directions, often with strollers, making it impossible to even bypass the more crowded areas.",Fantastic beasts and the wonder of nature at the natural history museum
"October 20, 2021","The natural history museum has some great exhibits, but the fantastic beasts exhibition is ludicrously overpriced and very lame. The obvious movie tie-in elements will interest young Harry Potter fans, but there’s precious little in the exhibition for anyone with more than a cursory interest in nature. I feel well and truly rinsed.",One of the worlds’ best
"December 30, 2022","We absolutely LOVE The Natural History Museum, it always boggles my mind that museums and galleries are free in the UK, but that’s one of the benefits of living and visiting here. We were lucky enough to just by walking by the museum, knew that we had nothing planned for the day and thought why not see how big the queue is… as it was just after opening we were lucky enough to get in super fast and without it being too busy. Please please please make a donation on your way in or around the museum so it can continue being amazing. We spent half a day here and you can easily spend a whole day and then come back the next to continue, there is so much to see and educate yourself with! Some of the displays have become rather dated, and it shows, they need a bit of an update, but the information they provide is still valid and the ‘main’ pieces are well maintained. All the staff are friendly and happy to help if needed, the cafes have tasty food and coffee at decent prices and the shops are very reasonably priced for gifts / toys etc. actually cheaper than some normal stores. The Natural History Museum is a must do.",Too crowded!
"August 29, 2021","Booked our tickets online in advance and gave a donation, which was all easy.  Arrived at the museum and didn't have to queue, which was nice considering it was still the summer school holidays.  The museum building is impressive.  When you first walk into the main entrance, you cannot help but be amazed by the huge whale on display.  But,,,after 2 hours, we'd had enough.  I'm sure it's not entirely the museums fault but I feel they could have done a lot more to keep people safe during covid times.  It was very crowded, especially in the dinosaur exhibition area.  It was a one-way system through a very dark and small area (they have packed so much in to what felt like quite a narrow walkway) and people clumped up together, many with bulky pushchairs, also lots of young kids running around unsupervised and bumping into people, and I very quickly felt rather claustrophobic. So we didn't actually stop to really look at anything in the dino area, we tried to get through the crowd as quickly as possible and out of the exit.  My 7 year old son had also had enough - it was simply too crowded, he couldn't see anything and could never get to any of the exhibitions to really look at anything properly because there were too many people in the way.  Such a shame.  After that, we made our way back out to the main hall and asked my son if he wanted to see more but he did not and we decided to leave.  I've heard so many people say that you could spend a whole day at the NHM, and i'm sure you could....on a nice quiet day without children.  But when it's busy, I personally couldn't wait to get out.  We only actually did the reptile, mammals and dino exhibition areas.  In all honesty, it was more interesting watching the behind the scenes tv series / documentary.  We've come away just feeling a bit disappointed and deflated by it.  We had rather high expectations after having enjoyed the NHM in New York.",Beautiful atmosphere. Disappointed by some aspects.
"March 21, 2020","The atmosphere is amazing. One feels like one is transported back to the 19th century. Well worth a visit. I was disappointed by the dinosaur section. Although the emphasis is put on education, the skeletons are mostly suspended above the walkway and not so easily visible. There is a definite effort to move away from a stuffy old museum layout towards a modern educational experience for youngsters (and adults), but doesn’t one come to this museum to be plunged into the old stuffy, dusty era of the great British discoveries and expeditions? That was just my own personal desire, so I’m not complaining.HOWEVER I was shocked to discover that there was absolutely no entomological section in the museum. There is a “creepy crawly” exhibit which is only educational. I wanted to see show cases of some of the world’s millions of fabulous fascinating insects. It took me a long time to discover there weren’t any, I asked one young employee where the entomological Section was. She said “the what?’. I asked another young staff member the same thing. She said “entomology. Is that insects?” and directed me towards a part of the museum where there were volcanoes. In the end someone told me that insects were no longer on display for the last few decades. Such a shame!",It was ok 
"October 23, 2021","I'm sorry but I really wasn't impressed, for starters when we arrived we were made to leave a small hand luggage bag in the "" cloakroom"" and charged £7 ! They actually weighed the case ! Why ? Nobody is carrying it around ! The other thing was you could leave a pram or buggy for a £3 charge !? Work that one out. Most of the hand sanitizers were empty which was surprising.I understand the museum is free entry, we would have made a donation had we not been stung by the bag charge. ",JUST DON'T GO HERE!!!!!!!!
"August 3, 2021","My wife and I visited last week as the country was starting to come out of lockdown,we had secured tickets and booked weeks before so we thought that the museum would be quiet as they were only allowing in bookingsHow wrong was I ,it was jam packed, we went to see the dinosuar exhibition which was narrow and in a  one way system,there was so many people in this small area ,banging into us,trying to get past us and the flow of people was such that if you slowed down to read or look at the exhibit someone would walk into you . Most people I believe ,like us were attempting to get out of this rat race and were jostling and bulldozing their way through.We never saw anything in this exhibition and decided it was far too busy.Had there been no pandemic and social distancing I would still been intimidated and bullied into leaving.I would suggest limiting the amount of people entering this section, we are patient enough to wait or perhaps be directed to something less busy ( I can not tell you if such a section exsists here as we immediately left)The nearest subway station was closed and we spent longer walking from the nearest open station to the museum than we did inside it.we spent longer waiting in the queue outside the museum than we did inside it.(did all these people have a booking at the same time as us ??)I would not recommend this ""attraction""",Worth a visit if you’ve not been before
"February 2, 2022","Well worth a visit if you’ve not been before. I visited 6 years ago then again more recently, not much has changed in that time. My other half spent hours in the mineral room looking and cabinets full of rocks, I lost interest about halfway through. I suffer from osteoarthritis in my knees and struggled with stairs, also I noticed a shortage of benches and places to rest. The Dinosaur exhibit is always very poplar but it’s hard to look at anything for long because you end being swept away by the throngs of visitors. This area was very narrow in places and claustrophobic. The restaurant offers lunch boxes and hot drinks, it’s really expensive for what it is (maybe be acceptable in London but came as shock to me).",Fantastic
"September 23, 2021","I have visited this museum before and I am very impressed with its management and organisation.  This is a fantastic place to visit and with free admission it has got to be one of London’s most impressive attractions.  Its architecture is exceptionally beautiful.  The interactive learning experiences for children are very accessible but much is to be learnt from all of the display areas.  Facilities are excellent and the restaurant and cafes offer good value for money, cater for food intolerances and offer a healthy range of food.  I shall definitely return again and again.",Great time
"May 8, 2020","I have been to museums all around the world and yes, of course, this is by far one of the best museums in the world. It is also one of the most comprehensive museums I have been to. This is a must see. We went there 3 days in a row just because we kept getting there late during the day and wanted to see everything b/c it was so niceThere is just too many people",A MUST SEE for adults and children alike
"April 18, 2022","The most outstanding natural history museum to see. We didnt event get to any of the paid temporary exhibitions and we spend hours (and could have spend many more) at  the museum. Vast and interactive, with an exciting dinosaur section and a huge minerals and stones section.Do come early as there are queues and despite the free entrance, do consider donating to the museum which is crucial to its sustainability. ",Impressive building with the wow enrance hall
"October 9, 2020","The building itself is worth a visit, purpose built and with lots of fascinating details like the climbing monkeys around the columns. Signs explain why the tatty, faded exhibits have not been replaced due to the delicate balance of preservation and curiosity.  However some are so bad they really should be removed even if not replaced. The dinosaurs are impressive, and without the high numbers being allowed in it is easy to walk around and read the information available. And it’s FREE, amazing, the online booking was simple and we walked straight in at our allocated time .","Fantastic day, here from 10am-3pm"
"November 4, 2021","Visited during October half term with my son, I had Booked tickets for 10am and when we got there the queue was SO LONG but thankfully because we had already booked we where directed to a shorter line around the side. Tickets scanned, quick bag check and we where in. Boy what an amazing place, we spent hours here looking at everything. Stopped in the cafe mid day for a quick drink. Then carried on exploring the museum. My son was in awe at hope and the earthquake simulator. Early afternoon we took a break to visit the gardens where my son did the trail that was on looking for clues attached to trees, I took a break and sat on the bench and just took in the fresh air and quiet away from the hustle and bustle (I have anxiety and crowds often get the better of me, please note my son is 12 and was within the gardens with me at ALL times, he also had his phone on him) the trail wasn’t long but was just what he needed to burn of some pent up energy and to enjoy some fresh air and safe open spaceBack into the museum where the queue for the dinosaurs was finally shorter so we got into the queue and visited the dinos which are amazing. Then up to see the birds and the giant sequoia and then we left at around 3.30 after a visit to the gift shop and another crushed penny for my sons collection.",A Good Welcome Back to Museums
"August 18, 2020","To be frank I rarely write reviews of anything in London since I live here and keep my reviews for my travels, However, in this peculiar year my travels are restricted to London so it seems reasonable to write reviews. I regularly visit the NHM for special exhibitions but here was an opportunity to visit the permanent galleries now finally reopened. You cannot do it all in one go so we visited the birds, the earth galleries upstairs and (of course) the dinosaurs. Book on-line. Enter on-time. Straightforward. Not a place for a specific route except amongst the dinosaurs. Busy there and with lots of children. Lots of hand sanitizer. Cafe open.",So so
"May 22, 2022","Visited with 2 children age 6 and 9. Kids liked the exhibits they saw, but it was really far too busy for any of us to see much at all and it really took away from the magic of the experience of visiting this iconic museum. We had booked timed entry tickets in advance, but no one was paying much attention at all to tickets as we went in and many of the areas were far too busy. Kids were looking forward to seeing the dinosaur area but were really disappointed by the conveyer belt feel to it that prevented them stopping to look as they went through. Less popular areas needed some TLC and the volcanoes and earthquakes section was so hot it felt like you were at a volcanoe. Fabulous that you the museum is accessible to all and free but i think that there are better museums in London that are all free to visit and handle visitor flow much better. We went to visit the british museum the next day and both children commented that they enjoyed it much more than the natural history museum due to it being less crowded. We won't be planning on visiting the natural history museum again.",Great exhibits but bring your own sanitiser!
"August 29, 2021","The museum itself is lovely; the building is magnificent and the displays are some of the best I’ve seen. It’s easy to spend a whole day in here. However, visiting during COVID wasn’t as enjoyable as it has been in the past. I’m not sure the museum itself is responsible for all of this, but I do think more could have been done to make the museum feel safer. This was one of the few places we visited in London where most people weren’t wearing masks, and it was busy. At times, it felt uncomfortable. Most of the sanitiser stations were empty, meaning people weren’t sanitising as much as they should. Lots of children were running wild and seemed unsupervised, which was a shame. I’d still visit here again as I love the museum and the exhibits, but I hope they do more to encourage COVID-safe behaviour.",Disappointing setup
"October 28, 2022","We took a day trip to the museum yesterday, and had booked tickets in advance for a specific timeslot. Initially we were pleased thinking that timed entry would mean a controlled number of visitors in a popular attraction. We couldn’t have been more wrong. First off we arrived early expecting to queue to get in and were waved in before our slot, and were met with instant chaos. There were people everywhere, literally all spaces taken up with people. From what I could see of them, the exhibits are well maintained and interesting, but you cannot get near most of them! At points we were stuck at a standstill with no way forward or back, with no evidence of staff around to control the crowds. We had booked to see Dippy with out ticket, something that is an ‘extra’ but the staff member on the door was waving people in shouting “I am not looking at tickets just go in”. We had planned a few hours for the museum but we left as soon as the crowd would let us as it was deeply unpleasant, uncomfortable and I suspect unsafe. There were families and groups sitting on the floor in front of display cases to have a drink/snack causing people to trip and veer into others, also meaning you could not view some exhibits. Again there were no staff around to stop this selfishness.",Disappointing visit to a probably great museum
"August 18, 2023","My family and I went to London for the first time and all of us were excited about one thing. Mine was this museum. I booked in advance and was puzzled to realize that the entrance was free. When we got there, there was a huge waiting line from where we were taken out immediately by a staff member as we had tickets. For us the entrance was fast and easy, however, the rest of the people on that line must have taken hours to get in.Once in, the first impression was spectacular and I got even more excited. Which, unfortunately, vanished quickly. The museum was so so crowded that it was impossible to see anything. The area where I was able to walk without being dragged by people was actually the gift shop. In my opinion, the purpose of a museum is for people to learn. Well, I learned nothing besides the fact that the building was very very hot. I don't understand the rationale for letting that many people get in. The museum shouldn't be another checkpoint in a tourist checklist and that was what it was. Since everything in London is paid ( even lounge chairs in a park) I don't understand why this museum would be free and dependent on people's donations. From a business perspective, I would say charge the entrance and control the number of visitors. For those who really want to visit despite facing this challenge, book ahead!!",I love this place
"July 16, 2020","I have been to the Natural History Museum countless times - taken as a child numerous times, taking my own children numerous times and this time just with my husband. I never tire of the place. So much to see and learn and done in a great way. The fact it is still a free museum is fabulous. Go go go",Wonderful museum but can get uncomfortable inside
"August 12, 2023","This is a wonderful museum. Many amazing exhibits and my young kids (aged 10 and 6) had a great time. I last went here many years ago before they had a booking system and it was absolutely jam packed then so was expecting it to be a bit less congested having to book tickets. This wasn’t the case, it was still absolutely packed in there and the glorious weather outside meant very uncomfortable conditions inside with no air conditioning in this historic building. We booked tickets for 4pm so an earlier morning time slot would probably be better. Despite the issues it’s still definitely worth visiting.",Awesome place to visit
"August 7, 2022","My sister and I paid a visit to this awesome venue, it started off from when we got off the tube at South Kensington.  We followed the signs for ""Museums"" and was led into a very long underground walkway.  This is impressive I thought as it meant no waking or crossing busy roads.  This tunnel leads to many different attractions and you have to admire the Victorians for their insight in creating this safe and pleasant way to get to where you are going, this alone is a great feat of engineering.  About half way along we turned left at our exit which brings you up into the grounds of the museum.  Wow your breath is immediatley taken away by this very impressive and very large building in front of you.  The granduer and bearing of the venue is very very impressive and it is just a wonder to behold.  The building took seven years to build and you just can't help but think wow.  We entered the museum to a vastly large entrance hall with alcoves along both sides with exhibts in each one.  There are three floors to explore and several areas to eat and drink there is also an outdoor area to just chill and relax.  The exhibits are more than breathtaking and a wonder to behold, it is very hard to comprehend the enormosity of what you are veiwing and that this stuff was around millions of years ago and here you are lookinig at what was on Earth at that time.  The whole museum is very well laid out, very informative and some lovely staff whole are more than willing to either help or impart their knowledge.  The inside of the building is just as impressive as the outside with beautiful brickwork and stone carvings along with an impressive staricase.   I loved the way that in the enclosed cases of some of the artifacts they have been replecated and placed alongside so you can run your hands overthem giving you a sense and feel of the real thing.  There are loads of things for children to turn, pull, answer so they don't have  a chance of being bored.  Of course I must not forget to mention my visit to seeing Dippy, I stand infront of this massive creature and bow to it's magnificance and you immediatey think of the film Jurassic Park and remember their graceful gate as they slowly walk, a massive gentle giant.  I have visited many places in the past but this place imprints a very lasting memory of our world over the millions of years and of those intrepid explorers with their never dying thurst for knowledge and for preserving our past.  My thanks also go to the 300 scientists who are still working hard in the background at the museum still unlocking those awesome parts of our worlds history.  Thanks for a great day out and very impressive and humble five and a half hours of our visit.  P.S if you love expensive jewellery you must visit ""The Vault"" wow these baubles are very impressive.",Wonderful free day out!
"February 18, 2020","Really enjoyed my time in this huge free museum.You could spend all day here alone or with your other half / family.It's amazing with all the things on display from T-rex, Wales and many other things such as diamonds and more! If you are in the area there are another 2 museums next to this the area is a 5 minute walk away from a huge park.",Great exhibits but so busy/hot
"February 19, 2020","Albeit it is half term week so I expected the busy aspect but oh my goodness it was so hot inside, sweltering nearly fainting hot. We targeted the dinosaurs which were a great crowd pleaser with the kids and started on the mamals but had to abort as all the cafes were packed and we were all too hot. I recommend an early morning start we went after lunch. Still one of my favourite museums though!",Great for kids - Titanosaur exhibition 
"July 5, 2023","We visited the Natural History Museum in July 2023 with ours kids aged 7 and 11. Our kids love dinosaurs, so we paid to enter the Titanosaur exhibition. The Museum is a beautiful old building which is impressive in its own right. The day we visited was pretty packed but that's to be expected at this time of the year. We were a little short of time so had to rush through most of the exhibits. We spent more time in the Titanosaur exhibition which was great and the kids loved it. It's quite interactive which keeps the kids engaged. Overall we would recommend the NHM, especially if you / your kids like dinosaurs 🦕!","Nice museum, shame about the cake?"
"July 22, 2023","Sadly I would have given this more stars had it not been for the fact it was utterly heaving with school trips, several at the same time, surely a better suggestion would be to limit one school trip per day so that the general public can enjoy it too, not all of us are kid friendly and would genuinely like to enjoy the museum without shouting/screaming kids shoving past me and acting out. The other thing I was a bit shocked at, was the prices in the café! My partner and I were all set to enjoy a coffee and cake until we saw the price of the cake! Having already spent a ton in the gift shop, I was reluctant to spend £7 on a small slice of cake. We can afford it, but think of the families with several kids, who are on a budget - just two kids having a slice is nearly £15 for cake, that's not even with a drink. We also chose not to visit the new exhibition of the Titanosaur after again seeing the price, for my partner and I to both go in, it would be over £30! for something we would probably spend ten mins in and apparently was more for kids anyway, which btw also cost £9 each..I know the museum itself is free, but this doesn't mean, crank up everything else, everyone should get to learn about animals and life and be able to get a piece of cake without breaking the bank.",Less crowded during Covid
"August 30, 2020","Ok so perhaps the museum isn’t quite as great during Covid. Some attractions are closed and not all the interactive exhibits are available. However, when you weigh this up with no crowds, timed entry, no queues etc I prefer this way of viewing the museum! Last time I came I had to leave it was so busy, so prefer it with restricted numbers. We visited on a Saturday at 2pm and felt like we were the only ones there at times! Felt really safe too. Kids loved it, which is the main thing. Can’t wait to return!",Dated exhibits but worth the visit
"February 3, 2020","It’s beautiful, and worth going to for the building alone. But a lot of the exhibitions are looking really tired and in need of some update. The human lab in particular needs some modernization. The geological exhibits were much more interesting and certainly felt current (maybe its the taxidermy on the biology side of the museum that gives it that dated feel as well). I loved the main hall and the volcano/earthquake exhibit especially, maybe that’s the Californian in me ;)",Grandiose
"January 16, 2020","If you love natural history museums this is the Vatican of natural history, the building alone is an exhibit of exquisite craftsmanship and an honor to all living things. All its exhibits old and new are a treasure. A must see if you are in London.",lovely big dinosaur skeletons
"February 10, 2020",I really like the natural history museum they've got some terrific stuffed animals there and its really good for engaging with kids while also not being totally obvious to adults. all clear and informative. the big blue whale is also a highlight.,Loads to see!!!
"October 10, 2021","A must do if your in London. This place is massive with loads to see,we went at lunch time after already doing plenty of walking around London in the morning and that was a mistake!! I recommend getting there in the morning fully energised because there’s a lot to get around also it gets warm in there so t-shirt is a must. All the displays are excellent to look at and also the the building itself is pretty special to look at aswell. Facilities are very good with plenty of toilets and seating.",Keeping up with the times
"February 10, 2020","On entering, you are met with an amazing escalator taking you up into the bowels of ... well,...  there are volcanoes, magma, earthquakes, And then the rest of the museum. So much to take in but laid out in an amazing fashion so it all makes sense and is so interesting. Such an enhancement from my last visit, too many years back!",Brilliant day out
"January 14, 2022","Amazingly helpful and friendly staff.Great exhibitions. I went with my husband and my 3 year old son and we all thought the exhibitions were informative and interactive. My son loved the earthquake and volcano area in the red zone best. The architecture itself is breathtaking. The different zones are well signposted and the museum us easy to navigate.The only area that was busy was the dinosaur exhibition, the other areas were not crowded at a all.The food in the central cafe was rather expensive but to be expected. The food was good quality and again the staff were very helpful. The nature garden is lovely, even in winterWe ended up staying in the museum for nearly five hours and enjoyed every minute of it.My only con is the heating.  Some areas seemed quite cold, others far too warm and stuffy .Overall this is a fantastic place to visit and I would definitely recommend.","Busy, hot, overcrowded in places"
"November 3, 2022","Maybe things always look better when you’re young but I wasn’t overly impressed.  My seven year old grandson however loved it.  I wouldn’t recommend visiting with younger children - his four and a half year old sister wasn’t interested at all.  Definitely worth booking your entry time slot as we went straight in.  Dippy is currently on display again but I don’t think he’s displayed in the best place.Very, very busy.  Too many people just taking “look at where I am” photos.  But that’s the scourge of all tourist attractions.DO NOT BUY FOOD OR DRINKS IN ANY OF THE CAFÉS.  The prices are extortionate and the quality very poor.  A child’s portion of dried up fish gluons and handful of stale chips cost nearly £7.00.  There are picnic areas so if you can bear it, bring your own food and drink.",Do not go at weekend
"December 29, 2021",Very interesting place with many treasures but trying to study or contemplate the exhibits is nigh on impossible when surrounded by children with parents trying to noisily explain the relevance of the items. Yes I too had children and appreciate the problems. All I suggest if you are not going with a young family do visit out of holiday times and weekends. By the way the cost of food here is considerable for second rate items. Our something and cranberry sandwich had a tiny pink stain which I guess was meant to be the cranberry content.,Highly recommended 
"January 22, 2020",If you have children this is a place to go. The exposition is very well organized and divided among subjects. The dinosaur part is very captivating and the vault is mesmerizing. The museum is free but make donations I am sure they will be very well used!!!,A must do thing in London
"July 25, 2022","We really liked our visit here.  I would strongly recommend booking your FREE tickets in advance as you can skip the queue to the desk which was very welcome.  It was very busy and hot on the day that we were there and in parts it felt uncomfortably full.  This is not really the fault of the NHM as they can only control numbers entering and not where people go.  We did cut our visit short because of the crowds but again that is not a criticism, it was our choice.  It was a little chaotic getting a cup of tea in one of the restaurants but again this would not stop me returning.  The building alone is worth the trip!! It is spectacular so even if you didn't like any of the exhibits you could not help but marvel in the architecture and the atmosphere.  The great hall, the marble, the staircases, the ceilings etc are magnificent.  I have been a few times and I will visit again as it just marvels me.  The actual exhibits are just as impressive but do give yourself a good few hours to visit.  Exit tube at South Kensington and you are right beside the building.  Should be on everyones list of things to do in London - I still cant believe that it is free!!!","A fun, educational and interesting place to visit"
"June 11, 2022","Such a great day out, the fact this place is free entry baffles me, I’d recommend donating if you can to keep places like this open for all to enjoy.Obviously it was extremely busy, but not to the point where it was uncomfortable to move. It was well managed.The place has something for everyone. It has really detailed information for people who it interests if you look for it, but also lots of fun activities and exhibits to interest the younger audience.The cafe was a little expensive but let’s not forget you are in the middle of London.The place was overall extremely clean and filled with friendly staff to guide you and answer any questions you may have.I definitely recommend a visit and also to take your time and learn something new.",So glad it was raining
"February 26, 2020","Hadn't intended to visit but as the weather was so wet, like a lot of people, we needed inside entertainment. So glad we opted for the NHM. Spent a few hours wandering around a beautiful interesting and informative museum. Well laid out into sections so you can miss out bits or double back and do some bits twice. Our granddaughter was fascinated but not overwhelmed as able to take on board all the info. It was half term so very busy but they did stagger entry so didn't feel too crowded. Cafes served lovely food and cakes. Shop was huge and reasonably priced and some great little souvenirs for kids. All in all a great few hours. ","Great day out for all the family, rain or shine. Expect it to be busy & pre book book tickets"
"February 28, 2023","I came here on Saturday, alone, to explore the museum. It is such a great collective of scientific work catering to all ages - it really is great for children and adults alike & explores a range of different topics (ie: animals, dinosaurs, earthquakes, human body, solar system) to cater to all interests. My only disappointments with my visit was that I hadn’t realised there was the wildlife photographer of the year exhibition taking place which was prebookable and so I could not enter as hadn’t bought the ticket. Something I will definitely check and attend in future. I would offer four pieces of advice.1. Book online ahead of your visit. It is still a free ticket when purchased online (with an option donation option) but you’re guaranteed a speedy entrance and bypass the crowds to enter. The queues were massive when I arrived but I walked straight in. 2. Expect it to be very busy. This museum is great and well known, it’s also linked to Sir David Attenborough. It’s a great activity for all the family and kills a good few hours, rain or shine. Therefore it’s always going to busy. Expect that and give yourself plenty of time.3. Do not expect everyone to be courteous. I found this quite frustrating during my visit, but many times people would just walk in front of plaques/signs you’re reading, stand in front of you, push in front of queues, and aren’t polite. I actually saw a group of teenage girls push past a group of people giving way to an elderly man with mobility issues and a walking stick on some stairs to the point where he was almost knocked over. It’s very frustrating but if you’re prepared for it, hopefully it won’t spoil your day.  4. And finally, expect to rack up lots of steps exploring all the exhibits so wear comfortable shoes!",Huge museum; book in advance
"March 27, 2023","There is so much to see in the Natural History Museum! We spent several hours there and only saw a fraction of the exhibits. It was a Saturday morning and there were a lot of families as well as visitors from all over the world but there is room for everyone to see something they will like. We found the fossilised sea creatures particularly fascinating, perhaps because we did not previously know much about them.The displays are well presented and explanations are clear and easy to read. One tip we were given and would like to share: book tickets online in advance. Entry as free if you book in advance or at the entrance to the museum but if you reserve beforehand you will not have to queue up to get in, and the queues can be very long.","Loved it, whale’s pretty cool"
"October 1, 2020",The museum was pretty awesome. However my friends hyped up that there was a big T. rex when it’s actually now a blue whale skeleton- still very cool. However not quite reliving night at the museum to it’s full extent ,Natural History Museum  
"February 12, 2020",Nestled across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum is another marvellous piece of architecture dating back to our ancestors. The Natural History Museum is a wonderful place to take children. As you walk through the skyscraper doors into the entrance way it is a feast for the photographic lens and if your lucky a display of a dinosaur or something that is magical and unbelievable will meet you upon your arrival. I Highly recommend this place when visiting London. Give yourself at least a minimum of 5 hours to visit if not a whole day. Oh and get there early before the crowds ,"Illustration, education amid grandeur"
"January 19, 2020","My wife and I along with my daughter's family with four kids visited this place on a dank, rainy Sunday.  Although busy, this cavernous facility swallows any crowd.  Many, many of the displays are simply stunning.  The architecture of the building is as well.  Kudos to the curators for imparting such a wide variety of knowledge to children and adults alike.",Wild life photographer of the year
"January 5, 2020","As always an excellent portfolio of photographs from around the world. Especially stunning underwater photographs. Terrific pictures of penguins. Some of the photographers went to great personal hardship to achieve excellent images, putting up with extreme conditions in freezing temperatures for days on end to achieve their objective - a stunningly different take on animal behaviour.",Go online and book in advance
"October 4, 2022","The museum has a lot to offer for both adults and kids of all ages. There's a fair share of reading in English involved, so be prepared for that if you're with kids. There's typically a longish queue in front of the building, but if you have made your reservation online - you just walk right past it and show it to the people at the enterance.",Visit the T-Rex
"January 4, 2020","This place is phenomenal. You can see galleries of all kinds of taxidermy animals and insects. They have amazing exhibits on minerals and metals as well. But the dinosaur exhibits are my kids' absolute favorite, especially the animatronic t-rex that roars and stamps it's feet. Such an amazing exhibit and worth the crowds to enjoy.",My favourite 
"January 1, 2020","This place is my favourite museum in London. I visit this place each time I visit london. Love their exhibits of extinct animals, fossils, dinosaurs, birds, mammals, marine lives etc. There are Sections for planetary system, geology, volcanoes etc. All in all I love this place. I would say for anyone with kids over the age of 7-8 years will enjoy this place. Kids will enjoy the exhibits of animals, the skeletons of whale, dinosaurs etc. There is a life size T. rex which is moves and makes noises. Kids love this. Very educational place for both adults and kids. I would always recommend this place. ","Must do the Treasures Museum , many miss this !!"
"September 15, 2021","I have been here many times here and can’t believe I haven’t been up the stairs at the back of the great hall to visit “The Treasures” which are the Museums greatest collections. Such as the first ever recovered fossil in the world that led to the discovery of the Dinosaurs and a Penguin egg that was one of three to survive being brought back by Captains Scott’s mission in the Antarctic. There is also a QR code that you can go to , to get an audio guide for more information on each exhibit. Just phenomenal.",Even better than expected
"January 19, 2020","We were very excited to visit the Natural History Museum of London. First of all, the building itself is gorgeous and a piece of art. The inside is also stunning, especially that blue whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling. We were very impressed with the exhibitions - the mammals, the dinosaurs, the different birds, the stones and other minerals. There are so many things to see, we spent about 2 hours there.",Like Ikea with rocks in.
"April 18, 2023","This place is like a massive ikea but with rocks in it.  The queue to get in was ridiculously long but I had pre booked so that was ok, pleased I didn’t have to stand in the queue.  Inside was just so crowded and hard to navigate and see all the exhibits.  The way finding signage inside was terrible as trying to find the toilets was a challenge in itself.  In the end I just got too hot and irritated by the crowds that we had to leave. Sad to see that the special exhibit that is in the news had to be booked and paid for to be able to see, it was fully booked the day we went.  Will not return.",Lovely museum
"July 7, 2021","Pre booked our tickets (which I think they should keep by the way!) and walked right in. No one checked our bags even though the people in front of us were being checked. Managed to look at all the exhibits which we enjoyed. Even though social distancing was there (signs on the floors and walls etc) barely anyone was adhering to it. We had brought sandwiches with us and went to the dining hall to eat them and it was closed! Both the website and the map said it was open so was a bit put out having to eat outside. Good job it was dry and not too bad as there was only 3 benches. Glad we came, my child had a great time and that’s what matters",Great place (avoid hot days)
"July 26, 2022","Amazing museum, but take our advice and avoid visiting on a hot day in summer during the holidays. Just so stuffy and overcrowded. Booked a time slot but no one seemed bothered about that and the dinosaur section becomes overwhelmingly crowded.",A great place to see history
"February 12, 2020",My kids love going to the museum and seeing actual remains of historic creatures.  As they are homeschooled we see this as an educational experience for them and have become members.  This provides discounts and access to the peaceful Anning rooms when you need a break.,Cool visit
"February 15, 2020","We visited Natural History Museum on 14.2.2020. I must say that average time spent there is 2,5h. Well we stayed for 4 and still skipped some places. I am so happy we went. Time well spent! In cafe behind Hintze Hall were delicious desserts and in shop in geology section you can get various types of stones as tiger's eye, amethyst etc.",The Photo Exbition was a special experience
"March 10, 2020","Our visit to the Natural History Museum was concentrated on the nature photos exhibition. The pictures of different creatures was fascinating, wether marine life, mamals, environment, small and large creatures. One could envisage the pacience in which the photographers approached their subjects resulting in an extraordinary good quality.",Terrible dinosaur exhibition
"April 8, 2022","Parts of the museum are great - the section on earthquakes is really good, and the mammals and creepy crawlie rooms are really well done. But the dinosaur exhibition is awful. The fossils, models, and info are great but it's crammed into what feels like a tiny space with very narrow walkways. Staff make it clear that they don't want you hanging around to actually read any of the information about what it is you're straining to see through the darkness, and it's so unpleasantly claustrophobic that you don't really want to hang around anyway. Honestly, it's so terribly done for what should be the NHM's crown jewel, and what 90% its visitors will be visiting to see. Huge skeletons tower above the walkway but it's so tightly packed in that there's no chance of appreciating it, and the T Rex skull is stuck up on some shelf in the ceiling. Really can't get over quite how badly the exhibit has been put together. Our autistic child had no chance, completely inaccessible to him and the environment was overwhelming in a bad way. NHM should be able to do better than this",Went for Titanosaur exhibition only 
"May 19, 2023",Primarily visited to see the Titanosaur exhibition only on our final day as my daughter was very interested.Over priced in my opinion and the queueing chaos outside would be unnecessary if properly organised. That said the queue did move quickly eventually. The scale of Titanosaur is vast and an amazing discovery. Sadly just another dinosaur to me. I was more impressed with the building!,Wildlife Photographer of the Year
"May 15, 2023","We went for the Wildlife Photographer of the Year with an 11 year old. We thought it was very good but she was bored there was nothing that we could see the interacts with kids. We also spent time in the Dinosaur room, which was great. The photography we have been before a few years back and thought this time lacked a wow factor. I would say its good to go every few years The Dinosaur exhibition I personally would have liked to see more real fossils and not models.","Always a great visit, especially as it’s free (apart from a donation)"
"May 14, 2023","Always a great visit. Lots to see and learn.Dinosaurs are a must!The only gripe I have is the layer of dust on some of the exhibits in the Mammal section. Clearly being missed, not a great show of preservation when can’t even clear the dust.",Great Visit
"May 14, 2023","We really enjoyed our visit found all the exhibitions really good, informative. Well worth the money as it is one of the free London museum. Would visit again in the future",Brilliant
"May 13, 2023","Fantastic place to spend a day, excellent facilities and the exhibits are so well presented, very easy to spend a day here and more",Weekday visit 
"May 12, 2023",It was packed with hordes of schoolchildren and  very hot inside the main hall. The noise was also loud and nowhere comfortable for an elderly person to sit and rest. I decided to abort my visit as it was so packed and uncomfortable.,Amazing Museum
"May 11, 2023",Love his museum although it is quite a tourist trap so gets packed. Easy to find your way around and lots of areas of interest,Good Natural History Museum
"May 10, 2023","This natural history museum has a good collection of dinosaurs, mammals/sea life, and other things related to science.  It's decently sized, though I would say in terms of variety of subjects, other natural history museums (like the one in New York) offer more to see.  It's hard to complain too much since admission to the museum is free.  It can get pretty busy, so make sure if you plan to spend a lot of time here to come as early as you can to avoid the crowds.",Heaving
"May 9, 2023","First off, the artifacts are amazing. No disputing that at all. I could go into detail but my entire experience was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of people that made it near impossible to enjoy. Some sections were just a 4 people wide queue, channelled through sections of the museum with no escape, no possibility to get closer to anything to view. Just jam packed. It was overall a disappointing experience and even my child felt uncomfortable so we just left early. I appreciate it is a free museum but why issue pre booked tickets just to overload the venue","Great for children, frustrating for adults!"
"May 9, 2023","This is an iconic museum, and it contains myriads of wonderful exhibits, but it is an ordeal to enter without pre-booked entry or membership and survival of the fittest once inside. It's great that so many children are being introduced to the world's wonders by their brave parents, but for other adults, browsing the exhibits is all but impossible. It feels like total chaos inside and accessing displays is a time-consuming challenge. Museum staff are probably delighted by its appeal, but for older adults it is not really worth the angst. We did get some brief reprieve on the World Wildlife Photography exhibition. This was well presented and engrossing but relatively expensive to enter. ",Skippable
"June 3, 2023","Visited on a rainy afternoon after hearing the museum was a “must visit” but was quite disappointed. The building is stunning but if you’ve been to a natural history museum anywhere else you sort of know what there is to see. There are some exhibits that have some cool elements but it is so big, busy and difficult to navigate with unhelpful signage that it takes hours to find the best things. If you’re only in London for a short visit, skip this and visit one of the many other museums instead",Great museum
"February 2, 2020","This is a great museum. Our 7 year daughter loved it. We arrived just after 10 on Saturday morning and had no problem to get in straight away,no queues. It started to get much busier after awhile. We spent 4 hours there,but you could easily spend all day if you wanted. Taking to consideration that it's free of charge I highly recommend it to families with young children.",Photographer of the year  
"March 2, 2020","Visited again after many years, and still in awe of the amazing entrance hall and intricate decor and stone work this beautiful building has to offer. We visited the Photographer of the year exhibit. Though a little pricy for what it is, it was still worth the hour spent reading into the story of each photo.Recommend if photography is your throng ",My favourite place in the Country
"August 19, 2022",I could spend many days in this place if I lived in London. I visited on a a very warm Sunday which I think is the best time as parking is free around the Museum. My daughters loved it lots of things to explore but our favourite was Dippy the dinosaur. The building is magnificent inside and out and is well looked after.,Just a museum.
"January 6, 2022",Average as far as museums go.Was a fun time looking at the dinosaur exhibit. Fair few things in this museum just don’t work due to covid and the interactivity is at a minimum.Fun for educating the younger generation though.Probably wouldn’t go back.,Become a member
"October 25, 2021","Visited the Wildlife photographer of the year exhibition. It is well worth becoming a member of the museum as you get free access to any exhibition that is on. You don't have to queue to get in, you get discount off anything you buy and there is also a quiet members area to get a quiet drink and a bite to eat.The Wildlife photo's were incredible as brilliantly displayed. I have never been into photography but this has made me want to revisit this exhibition every year from now on.",Excellent Attraction 
"October 30, 2020","Visited with my 14 and 9 year old sons. They had a ball exploring all the exhibits, especially the dinosaurs and the red zone which is about how the earth was formed. Loads to do, although most of the interactive parts are removed due to covid. Still a great day of fun and education  ",Natural History day out
"August 4, 2023",Everything is so dark and dated. Not enough seating in museum.Cafe seating very limited scramble for chairs.Only one WC near  cafe. Long queues.Very hot.Animated T_Rex brill as well as the two small furry ones.You must book a time on line it’s free and you jump the long queues to enter. However even though it’s free with a voluntary request for a donation inside you are met with a gang of staff pressuring you to cough up. Quite intimidating and put me off making a donation.The exhibits need brightening up and rethinking.Glass boxes after boxes of thigh bones is totally boring for children.,Good but very busy and hot
"August 25, 2022",The museum has some really interesting facts but today for us was far too busy and unbearably hot to stop and have a proper good look at anything.  The dinosaur bit was so hot and you where just getting pushed along. Maybe I would go back not in a holiday period and when the weathers a bit cooler,A must do
"February 24, 2022","Wow.Loved every minute.Very informativeLots to see and doImpressive fossils, bones and history of themKids everywhere were kept interested.Plenty of cafes, gift shops were resonable priced.Free entry though had to book at half term.",Fantastic museum
"August 24, 2022","Beautiful museum, so much to see and do inside.  We visited during school summer holidays which we knew would be busy, but it was a little too busy to enjoy and extremely hot inside.  I'm not sure if the museum would have off-peak season but if you can go during this - I'm sure it would be far more enjoyable.",WOW!!! Just Amazing!!!
"March 31, 2020","You would have to spend all day here to see everything. It took me 2 hours just to see one section out of four, I didn't even dawdle or read everything. There was one section that I just skimmed through quickly. This place has exactly the kind of stuff I was looking for. I did make time another day to go back and see a little more but as my trip was almost over I couldn't see everything that I wanted. This museum is great for kids and adults. I would say this was the best museum I've been to in the UK and Europe.",Book ahead and watch the weather
"August 10, 2023","This was a return visit for us, this time with younger children as part of our group. Booking ahead was definitely worthwhile as we were able to walk straight in and past the long queue standing outside on a very hot day. Choose your entry time wisely. We went at 1.30 pm and it was very busy. The building is very impressive but it isn’t air conditioned. There are some big fans in some places but these did little on the day we went. The hot day and number of visitors made the museum very uncomfortable in the most popular areas and  it got too much for the kids. We didn’t get round everything on this visit unfortunately but the main hall and dinosaur exhibit were hits.","This place is great, but far too many people."
"March 8, 2023","I love this museum, it's been my favourite for a long time, hence the overall score. Unfortunately, I hardly get to go anymore, despite living nearby. I have ASD, which in my case comes along with a lot of sensitivity to sound, and ADHD, which means that the tiniest of these sounds prevents me from processing anything else at all while it's happening. I'm not at all good with crowds, either.I used to be able to deal with this sufficiently enough to still visit regularly - in fact I had a membership for a while. But there are just too many people now - kids in particular. The scream and they shove and they block everyone else out of everything, and what used to be a mildly uncomfortable experience that I could tolerate well enough to still enjoy the museum has become an unsurpassable barrier.I understand that money is tight and free places are more popular than ever before, and I understand that a lot of kids love dinosaurs. And I truly don't want those kids to miss out. But there are just too many people let into the building at the same time. Multiple huge school groups every day during term time weekdays, and a flood of parents bringing them otherwise. It isn't just the kids either, there are too many people in general. As a neurodiverse person, it's just not possible for me to enjoy this space anymore.It would be nice to have a day here and there set aside for those who struggle with things like this, especially as dinosaurs are a particularly popular special interest for autistic kids. Booking in advance only to control the numbers, maybe? I really do miss being able to go. - My last visit was far before the earliest date I could select here, and I wish it wasn't.","Two hours waiting to get in, really!"
"April 8, 2023","Not sure why we queued for two hours because it’s free? My daughter needed loo after An hour and half and went right in?It seemed unnecessary and when we got in needed loo and restaurant immediately which ruined whole experience,Staff members need to inform visitors without tickets that museum is free and allow people in, doesn’t seem right to keep visitors especially children and disabled people like myself waiting to get into a museum that is free!",Great Exhibition - Wildlife Photographer of the Year
"February 7, 2022","We went for the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Exhibition.  This has an entrance fee, unlike the rest of the museum.  I have National Art Pass so it was half price.  We thoroughly enjoyed the Wildlife Photographer exhibition - the photos were stunningly presented with good captions.  Not crowded!  We also visited the dinosaur exhibition - appealing for both adults and children (especially the moving exhibits!)  We also visited Our Broken Planet exhibition (free to enter).  Lots of school groups and very interactive for the kids.  A wonderful building and stunning Victorian architecture, worth a visit in itself.",Surprisingly very enjoyable 
"July 6, 2022","I'm not much of a fan of museums however; felt we couldn't visit London without a trip here and I'm so glad we did.We spent hours exploring the museum! My son (9) in particular loved the natural disasters area. He spent a good hour or more at this area alone. The museum was very busy however; as it is so big you don't feel overcrowded.  There were plenty of sanitisation stations and good access to toilet facilities. There was a lack of places to refill water bottles and we did not rate the cafe area.  Almost £10 for one slice of cake and a can of diet coke! Now we expected it to be pricey, it is London however; this was way overpriced! We would definitely return if we visit London again.",A roarsome time!
"November 3, 2022","I visited today with my three young grandsons.  Easy to book our tickets with allocated time slots. We arrived late due to train issues but no one seemed bothered.  Tickets only briefly glanced at once.  Although not half term for most schools it was very busy, especially around the dinosaur exhibits.  There are lots of great things to see here, although layout is not easy to follow even with a map.  Kids loved most things especially the creepy crawlies.  We went to the T-Rex grill for lunch, queues were long and food took a little time to arrive but was very good, lovely salads and the kids meals were adequate. Gift shop had lots of options and prices were better than expected.  All in all a good day.",Disappointing planning
"August 5, 2022","The actual museum is amazing! Sadly, we didn’t get to experience it. We booked timed entrance tickets, but on arrival no tickets were being checked whatsoever. Because of this, the museum was packed. We physically couldn’t move. If we tried to stop to view anything, we were pushed along. At one point, we were told to keep moving by a member of staff, how can we appreciate the museum constantly moving? We tried to get food in the cafe but the children’s lunch bags all had a bag of popcorn in. This is a major choke risk for under 4’s! Please revise. Overall, so disappointed. We’d come from york so unfortunately won’t be able to re-attempt anytime soon!",Great if somewhat packed visit
"February 12, 2023","First things first. The natural history is obviously a world class facility with numerous excellent exhibits and a seemingly endless collection of objects etc. You could easily spend 2 days or more trying to fit it all in and probably still miss plenty of things.It is also free (although a donation is recommended).  However, my one criticism is that it was overly busy to the point of being somewhat stressful meaning we cut our visit a bit short. This is especially true in certain exhibits like the dinosaur area. Of course, it is good to see the museum being well used after covid but be prepared for it if you are not a fan of crowds.",Ruined by the crowds 
"May 2, 2022","On the surface this place is amazing and I would have given it 5 stars. The exhibits are out of this world and the staff are so knowledgeable and patient with children. We entered on Sunday morning so to start it wasn't too full so my son got a personalised experience looking at claws and teeth. The staff member was very knowledgeable and kept my son's attention and told my son how knowledgeable he was which made him feel amazing. What made it average was the amount of people the museum let in. Within 30 minutes you couldn't move in the place. The exhibits are not controlled so you can not enjoy and it makes it impossible for you to actually take anything in. Especially in the dinosaur area. It was completely ruined for our son who has ADHD and Autism. There was no control entering which means you couldn't read anything, the noise was unbearable for me let alone my child and people were pushing and shoving. My son asked to leave even though he wanted to see more. He couldn't cope with the chaos. I am very disappointed",London's wonderfully curated free museum that explores the natural world
"January 6, 2023","Here is another place I have been to many times but I recently treated my nephews and niece to a day trip to London and the museum, including a dinosaur mad nephew. The museum is still free and that is what makes the NHM such a wonderful attraction in London. There's loads for kids to educate themselves with and hopefully they'll learn something too.The only disappointment for me was how crowded it was and how stiflingly hot the museum was on a very warm August day. I'd been a year earlier on a solo trip and it had been January. I would actually suggest there is no reason why you can't visit the museum out of holiday season. Not that i blame the NHM for allowing the crowds to flock in. Hopefully they get a good income from all the crowds in the summer. It is a wonderful UK institution and hopefully remains free for all time.I will note that you can donate to the museum but it is wonderful that it will always be there for everyone to enjoy, regardless of income. If you can afford to donate then please do so. It helps keep these attractions going.",Can't wait to go again
"November 28, 2022","Last week we went on a school trip to the Natural History museum. We came by train to Victoria station, then took the underground.  It was an easy trip and the walk from the tube station to the museum was quick.The museum was cool and the exhibits were interesting. My favourite was the mammal exhibit and seeing the whale. We didn't get to see everything, so i would like to visit again. The earthquake simulator wasn't the best, but the rest was good.I recommend that family, friends and children should visit the Natural history Museum.",If you like this sort of thing
"September 26, 2021","A few people said to go here so we did, no queues we went straight in, first thing I noticed was the staff were quite pushy for everyone to leave a £5 or £10 donation on entry, this was at entry point and I thought well let me see what its all about first and how good it is and then I will decide.Sorry to say it was pretty boring for me, I did not see anything that really took my interest, volcanos and earthquakes along with loads of rocks and dust movements.Apparently they get over 5 million visitors a year which is great for them, possibly because its free admission though, but its not for me.",Nature’s wonders in an amazing setting
"June 5, 2021","We took our little ones for their first visit and as usual it didn’t disappoint. The booking process was simple and effective.We visited several galleries including the dinosaurs and they loved every minute.  They had fun learning about the amazing exhibits and enjoyed some of the interactive displays, making a volcano etc. Throughout the museum is immaculately clean.  There are numerous well stocked hand sanitisers. The cafe has a range of well priced snacks snd light meals.The guides were very friendly, keen to help and great with the kids.",Unfairly treated
"June 28, 2021","Felt like without pre booking tickets was penalized unnecessarily forced to wait longer in large cue whilst pre booked ticket cue was empty for while. When entered had locked suitcase checked, bottle of open alcohol was inside from a few days in london sightseeing trip. Even tho it was not hidden and remaining in locked suitcase going in locker before walking around, was refused entry unless disposed, which even Houdini would of found impossible to take sip from, especially annoying when other visitor where told behind me carry on in without bags being checked. Very disappointing after great experience with other attractions.",Far to many people
"September 24, 2023","Very disappointed with our first ever visit to the museum. I appreciate that the museum is free to get in and donations are voluntary however the museum was ridiculously full. My 8 year old walked in and wanted to walk straight back out. We barely saw anything as there was so many people in there that you couldn’t get close to anything to look at, take pictures. Nothing. We were in there 45 minutes and left. Every one pushing and shoving each other, it was so warm in there it was over whelming. Real spoilt our trip there and to be honest we wouldn’t be in a rush to go back. Not with numbers like that in there. Real shame",You can't go wrong with free entry. Fantastic way to spend a few hours.
"March 26, 2022","a month agoIconic London museum which is a must see for the whole family.This stunning building houses a natural history collection dating back billions of years. It's a huge place with many different sections and it's very difficult to do the whole thing in one go. It's free though and you can come back again.Dinosaurs, human evolution, volcano and earthquake zones are just some of the things to see and enjoy. With a number of cafes, plenty of bathrooms and gift shops, there is something for everyone. The architecture of the actual museum is beautiful and we had an amazing time.",Pleasant to go now it’s now so busy
"June 21, 2021","During covid times, it’s a much more pleasant experience- not too busy and bookable slots. We haven’t been for 15 years, and back then it was so busy you couldn’t really see all anything with small children. Now the kids are grown up and times are different, it’s clean, spacious and well signed. The toilets are spotless, cafes available ( we didn’t use) . My only criticism is it closes at 6, so we struggled to see everything and we arrived at 2.45.",Fantastic day
"December 3, 2022","I visited the Natural History Museum with my 14-year-old son and it was certainly a day to remember!As we visited on a Friday, the Museum was not too busy, which meant we could have a leisurely walk round without having to rush. To get there, we travelled to London Bridge Station and got a black cab to the Museum. On the way, we saw plenty of London landmarks such as Trafalgar Square, the Shard and Tower Bridge.The Museum itself was incredibly interesting; the best parts were the massive Blue Whale skeleton and the dinosaur area. We ate in the T-Rex restaurant which offers a wide range of lovely food. I had a naked chicken burger and my son had a fish finger sandwich, both of which came with salad and chips.We would definitely recommend the Museum to others. We will visited again!!!!",Beautiful but too crowded and hot
"August 15, 2022","Had it booked for Saturday at 12:00 hoping it would not be too crowded. Unfortunately, it was super crowded and way too hot almost everywhere inside which completely ruined it for me.The emtrance hall looks amazing as well as the dippy part which was suprisinigly empt and cool. Everything else we rushed through.Not something I would recommend visiting in the summer.",A must when visiting London
"September 5, 2021","What can be said about entering this magnificent building but 'breath taking'.  The architecture if phenomenal let alone the exhibits.  We spent 2.5 hours in the museum. Unfortunately, we did not have time to visit every exhibit however as it was free to enter, this did not matter.  We would definitely return.",Kids screaming and shoving people out the way
"October 2, 2022","Used to visit this museum repeatedly when I lived in London ten years ago, and have been looking forward to returning. I shouldn’t have bothered. Wall to wall with screaming children. I was shoved out the way by kids just for them to bang on the glass and have no interest in the very items I was trying to look at. Groups with pushchairs stood around having conversations and blocking exits. They should seriously consider adult only evenings on a regular basis for people who actually want to look at the exhibits and not put up with this chaos. It was ruined, I won’t be returning any time soon.",Fun for all ages
"February 25, 2020",Excellent dinosaur exposition. Beautiful building. Entry is free (although donations are encouraged). Went with a 4 year old who was very excited to see all the dinosaurs and animals. We also learned tons. Plan for at least 2h and arrive early as this place gets super busy on weekends,Good Natural History Museum
"May 10, 2023","This natural history museum has a good collection of dinosaurs, mammals/sea life, and other things related to science.  It's decently sized, though I would say in terms of variety of subjects, other natural history museums (like the one in New York) offer more to see.  It's hard to complain too much since admission to the museum is free.  It can get pretty busy, so make sure if you plan to spend a lot of time here to come as early as you can to avoid the crowds.",Super size museum!
"August 4, 2022","Great place. Free to visit, but we left a donation. Lots to see and do! Some very fascinating exhibits! Very easy to get lost! The place is massive. Sadly It was extremely busy and we could barely move freely , that coupled with the fact there is no air con, and it being incredibly hot inside didn’t make a comfortable experience.They advise to book a ticket to guarantee entry, we did this but don’t bother because they never checked our tickets, we just got let in.",A museum in all its glory
"July 11, 2023","This was an unplanned visit and - as it happens very often with unexpected things - it was a marvellous experience. A friend took us there without telling us in advance, and we enjoyed every minute of it. It has to be said that the museum is huge, and if you wish to have an in-depth visit, two full days will not be enough. Actually, after a while you can easily start feeling dizzy and in need of refreshments. We opted for a speedier course, prioritising certain sections and leaving others, and we managed to see most of what we wanted in just under two hours, every minute of that time well spent.",Too hot but stunning building
"August 13, 2022",A balmy summers day meant the non air conditioned cathedral of knowledge was unbearingly hot. It meant I couldn't grasp the full wonder of the exhibits and treasures on display. But other than the unbearable temperature the actual facade of the building is breath-taking. A true paradigm of gothic architecture. Simply stunning,Fascinating old building
"May 3, 2023",Loved our visit and loved seeing this beautiful historic building. Would love to see them admit less people at a time. We reserved free tickets in advance and no one checked the time. The museum (during Easter week) was PACKED to the gills. People everywhere and a very long line outside. The museum would have been a much more pleasurable experience with about half the people there.,For young children only
"August 6, 2021","t's a beautiful building, filled with lots of fascinating things but our experience was spoiled by several factors. I visited with my teenager on a weekday morning in the hope it would be quiet and stress free. We really wanted to see the dinosaurs, it was our main reason for visiting, but the exhibit was boarded in so the walkways were far too narrow and so dimly lit that we could hardly see. Social distancing was impossible and it wasn't possible to properly appreciate the dinosaurs as young children were running everywhere,  knocking into us and parents with no masks on not telling them to behave.  The museum is totally geared towards young children,  with basic information and interactive activities, consequently my fourteen year old daughter said she felt too old for the place! The invertebrate exhibit in particular was aimed at kids under 11 and as an adult I felt there was nothing for me to learn. Maybe we were comparing it to the New York museum of Natural history too much, which was so much better and more adult orientated. Great that it's free though as we only spent an hour there and would have been annoyed if we had paid for it.","""Gargantuan"""
"June 24, 2022","As a Jurassic Park addict, as soon as I entered the main hall of the museum. It just reminded me of a movie “Night at the museum” don't ask me why. It is a gargantuan museum that has a place to display skeletons of the most famous lived animal t-rex to the largest living animal whale. The museum has a vast range of fossils, also skeletons of dinosaurs and mammals. The mastodon skeleton is my favorite, which helped me connect with the movie Ice Age. Lots of stuffed animals to check out. There is a display of two giraffes where one is just the skeleton of a giraffe and the other is a stuffed one which looks real. Then there is an elephant family from big ones to small that is such a great site to watch. Other than the objects displayed, the architecture of a building itself is a fruitful site to visit. Overall a must visit place in London.",Worth a visit - but don't go on weekends
"August 17, 2022","Certainly one of the most amazing museums in London, and it's huge! You'll need at least 4 hours based on my experience to ""see"" everything, but not in detail. Better plan a whole afternoon for the visit. The best time would be in the morning. Don't go on weekends, as it can become super crowded. Some areas are quite warm, make sure you carry some water with you. The museum is okay for kids, but it's quite a long visit so make sure you plan for enough breaks and entertainment.",All things nature
"October 29, 2023","I love natural history museums and the NHM is my favourite of all. The builing is beautiful, the Hintze hall utterly impressive, and the latest Treasure galleries mesmerising. It's easy to get around and every now and then staff brings out some artefacts to show you and let you hold.It tends to get crowded during the weekend, so a weekday visit is best.They ran a Jurassic Park 30th anniversary pop-up shop which was whimsically fun.",Poor social distancing management
"June 11, 2021","The museum exhibitions were fine, however I did not feel at all  Covid secure in several areas of the building...* No social distancing whatsoever in popular sections such as the dinosours zone.* No attempt by staff to limit the number of people entering the popular / busy areas.* Many children not wearing masks.* Insufficient hand sanitiser stations around the building.I felt a lot less safe than shopping in a supermarket or travelling on a train.",Amazing experience and delicious food in the cafe!
"August 15, 2022",This was amazing - from the displays to the food.  Even though is was FULL of people (summer holidays) the experience was fantastic.  So much to see and do.  The food in the restaurant was the best I have ever had in a museum - so much choice of delicious fresh food - the chef/chefs obviously love their job! Thank you!,Loved it!
"October 21, 2020","I loved this museum. I've been wanting to go for a long time now and I'm so glad it finally happened. Quite often you look at places and it says you will spend this much time at the venue and generally it ends up a lot less than stated. NHM say 4 hours. We were in here longer. There is so much to see, so much to learn. I think a forgotten area of the museum is the zoology area. Personally, this was one of my favourite parts but my interests are within this. But it is amazing to look in jars and see how well animals and plants have kept over the years. ",Wouldn't come back.
"August 7, 2023","Absolutely heaving inside,clearly don't limit the numbers of people coming in to actually make the place enjoyable. Can't really see any of the attractions because of the mounds of people already looking at them,hence why limiting the number of people who come in would be a good idea. Boiling hot inside don't think there is any air conditioning. Place isn't clearly signposted to find where all the exhibits are. Did expect a lot more from this museum,and won't return.",Loved the dinosaur and earthquake exhibits
"June 14, 2022","This is a must visit while in London.  We liked this more than the other museums.  The dinosaur exhibit was fantastic.  Very educational (as was every exhibit) and plenty of large scale models.  Felt like I was living in the age of dinosaurs.  The earthquake and volcano exhibits were also exceptional.  One of the rooms simulates the shaking that happens during an earthquake.  They also have insect exhibits, ""Sea Monster"" and Coral Reef exhibits.  All are excellent.  Best to allow an entire day for your visit.  ",Titanosaur exhibition totally over gamified. Not suitable for adults.
"July 20, 2023","Sadly, the exhibition is totally over-gamified.  To find out information you have to play games, lift flaps, pump fake hearts.  Why can't we just read that information? The gamification just means it takes more time to learn anything and if you're in the middle of trying find something out, some little brat comes along unsupervised and takes over randomly pushing buttons or flipping things over not learning anything at all.  And of course you can't say anything to a child these days. Sadly, this is the way of most of the rest of the museum: not designed for adults at all, and pitched at children who are allowed to run riot and are unlikely to learn anything. The two stars are for 1) the art work of the titanosaur exhibition which is delicately beautiful and 2) the actual construction of the exhibition  in modular form so it can be transported easily. I'm afraid 0 for content.  It really is not worth the £16. ",Not to be missed
"July 22, 2022","We took our 4 year Granddaughter here to see the cbeebies Andy's Prehistoric adventures clock, which we did. However, she loved every part of the museum, including all of the animals and interact activities. Will definitely visit again, not to be missed. Book your tickets online before your visit.",Exceptional and it is free!!
"February 23, 2020","You can spend a full day here if you wish there is so much to discover and it is all for free, because of this it is naturally busy but the flow of people is constant and well organised.  There are places to get a drink and food and of course gifts too.  If nothing else just be in awe if the architecture.",Amazing
"September 9, 2021","Fantastic museum with plenty on interesting displays for all age groups. Interactive pieces to support the artifacts and keep children engaged and entertained. All housed in a stunning building. The Fantastic Beasts which was an additional cost ticket was ok, but the rest of the museum was far more interesting. Especially the the dinosaur displays and creepy crawlies for the children. Highly recommended!",Always a wonderful day out
"July 20, 2023",Having been to the Natural history museum as a child and again when my children were younger we went back on our own to revisit the museum. Something haven’t changed but there is so much that has which makes it worth coming back! A wonderful day out which never disappoints.,Amazing Place
"August 31, 2022","What a wonderful place to visit. History in every corner. Amazing for the kids as well, there is so much to see and achieve.The staff was very friendly and some of them we could see how much they enjoy working on the Museum.Congratulations to all for the amazing work and dedication!!!",Free day out
"October 22, 2023",Visited for our birthday weekend drip for daughter. It was brilliant to have some free things to do as it all adds up quite quickly. We had a great time though. 21/10/23 queued for around 30 mins. They said 5-10 mins from where we were but it was definitely longer - although not moaning. Annoyingly you can book tickets to go in and fast track everyone else (we didn’t know this!! Highly recommend going). Exhibitions were really cool. Interactive. Food was reasonably priced (expected it to be expensive but wasn’t as expensive as thought). Great day out! ,Disapppointed. Purely due to heat and overcrowding. 
"September 2, 2023","So, I booked online in advance (for free) … when we arrived no one looked or checked and due to it being free people just walked in which is great BUT… it was so crowded we could barely see any exhibitions it was also HOT, so hot. Our experience was ruined and we couldn’t wait to leave to be honest. There was so many people and it was so warm I ended feeling unwell. The museum in itself is huge and looks like alot of effort has gone in and could be a good experience. ",Everyone should visit!
"June 30, 2021","We absolutely love this place! This was our 4th visit and there's still more to see. So many amazing exhibits and plenty to keep children of all ages interested. Would highly recommend a visit.The only thing that disappointed me was when a rude customer in the coffee house decided to be very difficult, the manager, instead of defending his colleague, decided to pander to the shocking behaviour and reward the customer with free coffee. He was so spineless, he would have fitted in perfectly in the invertebrates exhibition. The message was very clearly ""treat my staff however you want and get rewarded for it"". I hope the young girl is ok.",Lots to see 
"October 18, 2020",You cannot experience the extent of the museum in one trip. There is plenty to see and learn about. Definitely a must see for visitors. In the winter they also hold an ice skating rink that is pleasant but better to use earlier as it is full of puddles later on in the day.,Highly Recommend!
"August 20, 2022","I was totally amazed by this museum and the fact it is FREE! It isn’t normally my sort of thing-but I went along with my partner to visit and I’m so glad I did! I was mind blown! There is so much to see here, and is something for everyone. The museum is split up into different coloured zones each offering something different from dinosaurs, fossils, mammals, Attenborough section, rocks and rhinestones etc. There is so much to see and take in you definitely need to visit for a fun day out in London! Lots of toilet facilities available and lots of eating places available, although these are pricey-however in respect to the fact that this is a free event that is to be expected.",Welcoming
"November 21, 2022","The building is magnificent, so many interesting details everywhere.  The children with us enjoyed many exhibits, particulaly the Dodo and also the dinosaurs.  We had lunch in the restaurant and the food was delicious and good value for money.  A lovely visit.",Too busy! Couldn't enjoy it. Pre-booked tickets worked well for us.
"August 1, 2023","I visited with my 12 year old son. It was sooo busy! You couldn't move freely around exhibits, which made it difficult to view and very hot. The weather was wet outside, so I dread to think how it would be on a hot day. They had fans on but it wasn't enough. If the museum restricted visitors a little it would be a wonderful place to visit. We ended up leaving not long after getting there.We pre-booked our tickets which worked well - we walked straight in.",Crowded!
"February 15, 2023","Was there on a saturday, booked tickets the day before and earliest was 13.15. To say this place was crowded is an understatement. Way too many people to enjoy everything. I found the dinosaurs the most interesting, but in that room you were stuffed like fish in a barrel. It's nice to have been there, but I have been to museums that I liked alot better.",Great museum
"June 4, 2023","Beautiful museum, lots to see and we were lucky to visit during half term and there were a couple of dinosaur related activities and shows for the children, the show in particular was great and very funny. The museum building itself is stunning. Staff were helpful. Didn't have to queue as we prebooked tickets, but queue for those that didn't have tickets was crazy.","Nice, but expected a bit more"
"September 8, 2023","We expected a bit more to be honest, we felt the museum is mostly for children and doesn't have that much on display, given the colossal building size  (for example no insects were on display in the 'creepy crawlies' and a large part of the museum is about vulcanos and earthquake). Does have a lot of rocks in the earth exhibition. None the less it was a nice visit, dinosaurs are worthwhile and impressielve main halls. ",An attraction on our London attraction itinerary
"September 12, 2021",Spent 3 hours here. The David Attenborough part for really good in respect to the current state of the planet. Not too impressed with the museum overall. Probably not what we really expected therefore more research prior to the visit would have been beneficial,Good experience but ridiculously crowded
"August 8, 2022","Great selection of things to see, learn and do. Very educational and fun but the museum was ridiculously crowded. We felt like sardines in a can, you almost couldn't even walk through the people, not speaking about seeing anything. So come during week days/early (we were there on Sunday morning). However the staff and the organization are great, toilets and seats everywhere, water fountains etc.",Titanosaur overpriced
"August 21, 2023","NHM has always been a family favourite and I am now taking my gandchildren. They are still at the dinosaur stage but do get something from other exhibits. Main focus of the visit today was the Titanosaur exhibition. This is well done and the kids enjoyed it BUT it was dear and there were few genuine exhibits - mainly  screen based exhibits. As an adult if I had paid full price for myself I would not have found it good value. Also it is ""exit through the gift shop"" which makes buying a toy hard to avoid - but be warned a model titanosaur is £22!!Overall I think some exhibits feel a little worn out and some have been replaced by shops. A bit more of staff explaining and interacting would be appreciated to add life to some galleries.",History in a building
"August 28, 2023","It is astounding how much history you can cram into 1 place.   The exhibits are extraordinary and some breathtaking. I particularly liked the collection of gems and the gigantic tree as a focal point, but the whale dinosaur at the heart of the building is a nice touch. It is very confusing to navigate if you don't have a map and very easy to get lost due to the enormous size of the building.",Truly horrible 
"January 11, 2020","I've been to many a museum in my life, and this was such a disappointment. I went there for the dinosaurs, looking forward to a waste selection of great specimens being displayed in various ways. What I got can be best described as a McDonalds display crammed into 1 small room where kids and adults were pushed through tight walkways while looking at plastic casts and just boring displays I was in Vienna, Austria and their museum before Christmas....1000 times better. Class, amazing pieces. This was utter garbage ",Great place to visit
"June 4, 2021",Came here with 2 five year olds and a 10 year old. So much to see and we had a fabulous time. After the kids had seen the dinosaurs however they got a bit bored but we had done most of the museum so not too bad. Such a good time though and would come back again. Would be great to see more interactive things for the children and I must say that the staff were lovely and very knowledgeable,Dinsoaurs! Roar!
"March 28, 2023","It looks like a great place. I've been a few times but we never get further than the dinosaur skeletons. My cousin just stomps around and makes roaring sounds at the skeletons, pretending he's a big scary dinosaur like them. I've always worried they'll kick us out but they've always been really good about it all. We always avoid the busiest times though. ",Hot mess
"August 3, 2022",I have been to the museum previous times and had a great time but when I visited yesterday with my 3 children one of whom has special needs it was not great. Trying to cram everyone in like sardines which became a massive sweat box. Couldn’t even look at anything because way too many people. My special needs son loves dinosaurs but couldn’t get to look at anything properly so had to leave because he wasn’t coping. Such a shame,Dino Snores overnight experience
"January 1, 2020","Dino snores is an appropriate name, snoring reverberates around the place during the night. Activities are well organised but feels much more like an educational experience than the adventure advertised. Overall, I love the museum and would consider this a once in a lifetime experience, happy I have survived it and less keen to do it again. ",A huge museum full of many things to see
"May 1, 2022","The museum is huge, bigger then any museum I’ve ever seen! It has a huge selection of minerals if that’s your thing, not mine personally but wow, so many minerals it makes you get a bit dizzy trying to look at them all. You also have fossils, skeletons of dinosaurs and other animals and they are impressive! I didn’t really understand the wildlife part, seemed to not have many actual things to see and and the wildlife garden was nothing special at all. Overall a huge place with loads to see and it’s free!",New gems everytime
"September 12, 2023","Decided to go late this time to try and beat the crowds, this somewhat worked, but still very popular. There is just so much to see here, it's really not just for kids. The formidable teeth and claws tap into my inner child (as this has been and is a family favourite). But these days I make a beeline for the small room just up the stairs at the far end of the main hall. This innocuous little room holds just a few objects but the greatest treasures in the museum, maybe the greatest treasures of natural history. My favourites are:The first discovered dinosaur bonesA first edition of Darwin's controversial masterpiecePressed flowers from Captain Cook's voyagePenguin eggs from Scot's trip to the Antarctic I would go on... but I really don't think you can top connecting with that sort of iconic history",A collection of history and science not to be missed
"August 19, 2021","Visited a few times before but took the kids this time, I’ll be honest this whilst still amazing was my worst visit. They haven’t relaxed enough post COVID, the missing dinosaur in main hall is a total disappointment and the rip off that is the magical beasts is not worth the money. That said the normal standard collections, information and history is amazing as ever",October Half Term Visit
"October 26, 2022","The Natural History museum is always worth a trip.  Visiting with my adult daughter who last visited when she was a young teenager brought back happy memories.  The dinosaurs will always be my favourite, Dippy is Back and I love the Blue Wale and the vast skeletons of these long gone creatures.  The earth zone is wonderful with its insight to Volcanos and how the earth works and is a home to us all.  The displays on the evolution of the human species are so engaging and interesting.  Always worth how ever long you can spend in it and always worth the short queueing time, unless you are smart enough to pre-book ticket entry.  Entry is free and you are ensured of wealth of memories of your visit.  ",Everyone should go
"September 13, 2022",No matter how old or young you are the Natural History Museum is a place for all. With a lot to see and learn. The grand hall is my favourite place the details in the works of the building are extremely intricate. DON'T FORGET TO DONATE,This is a wonderful place to visit
"March 27, 2022","The animatronics  are really amazing - makes the dinos look real. Its a great learning experience for children. We went to it as the V & A Museum ended up being closed that day and this is right next to it. Had not had it on our list of things to do, but we are sure glad we went and we will go back again",To busy
"July 26, 2023","We had booked timed tickets for 2pm but were told we could go in at any time!! What is the point of timed tickets?This resulted in masses of people, not really an enjoyable experience and the extortionate prices the cafes charge did not help things. A shame that Dippy was not there ",So much to see
"August 2, 2022","We had a great couple of hours exploring the museum, lots to see and do. Being free however there were lots of people to compete with to see past! It was just too busy for us, you'd wind up waiting ages for a go to see something and then felt rushed when reading or whatever. It really was fantastic though, so many things to see and read about, but maybe limiting the numbers would benefit?",Amazing place to spend an hour or a day
"October 2, 2023","Fantastic place to enjoy as adults, teens and kids. We had not limited time so we concentrated on the Treasures Gallery and the dinosaurs. I loved the opportunity they gave to touch and feel examples of the objects on display. Don’t forget to admire the architecture and watch the stonework inside and out, there is a menagerie of animals carved lovingly into the stonework.Better still it’s free!!! So even if you only have an hour you can pop in and see a few items even if you can’t explore everything you might want to see.",Very Busy Midweek 
"June 26, 2022","Very busy full of school kids (midweek in June) and not many maps to find your way around - £1 for a paper map.  We eventually found the dinosaur exhibit which was disappointing, a one way system round a room crammed full far too much info and not much exhibits, very busy and frustrating/hot.We then gave up and left as it wasn't a pleasant experience.No idea why we had to book tickets (free), stood outside and booked on phone and then someone glanced at it on the way in.I'm sure it would be better on a quieter day or if there was more room to allow people to walk more freely.",Old fashioned and boring
"October 18, 2022","I found the museum very disappointing. The building itself is impressive and the blue whale in the great hall is worth a look.The dinosaur exhibit is boring and very old fashioned. And you can’t have a proper look at the skeletons because most of them are behind glass, up in the air or in a cramped space.The mammal exhibit was closed when we was visiting.I prefer the national history museum in Berlin at all times, if you have been there skip the London museum and spend your time elsewhere.",Excellent museum with items from thousands of years to recent collections
"September 11, 2022","A lot of exhibits to look at, very intresting, kids would also love it. Make sure you have good shoes as the musuem is massive and if you want to see it all, there would be a lot of walking.I would say give at least 3 hours planning time if you want to see it all, especially if you do read some items.",Great Place
"August 22, 2022","Amazing that this place is available to visit for all (donation apply). Could easily spend a week here absorbing information! 4 star review given because the place is too dark and overbearing in places, packed with people and stifling hot!!! Not a comfortable visit. Food from cafe a bit pricey,especially if you have a family.",The  Wildlife Photographic Exhibition.
"February 19, 2022","This exhibition was absolutely stunning. 100 protographs, displayed at one metre wide as backlit tranparencies.  The most amazing pictures There are many very talented photographers out there, some children's work on show too. If you like stunning photographs, go and see it. ","Well curated museum, but definitely draws kids/families the most"
"December 6, 2023","It's a massive museum geared towards science/natural history. It was extremely crowded the day I went (a weekday) with many families and school groups. It definitely has interesting exhibits (the OG Charles Darwin pieces, the dinosaur exhibit, the escalator that goes through a planet, etc.) but I was not expecting it to be so loud and noisy for a weekday. Great for families/kids and everyone of all ages, but be aware it's definitely great for younger audiences and will be noisy because of this.",Worst museum I‘ve ever been to.
"October 13, 2023","Worst Museum ever… First of all it was extremely crowded and loud. More like a theme park vibe than a museum. It was impossible to stand and read and look at the exhibits.But even if it wasn‘t so crowded, it would be dissappointing since most of the exhibits are replicas or cheap plastic figures.The building itself is extremely pretty and it‘s sad they wasted the possibility to create an amazing museum.The donation booths are at the entrance and they know why; if they would be at the exit, no one would donate a single penny for that.Safe your time and energy and don‘t go there.",alright get bored in 30 min go if you like nature ans science but you will get exusted if you spend the whole day their
"December 9, 2023","Hey there! I went to the Natural History Museum and it was pretty decent. There were donation boxes all over the place, but they weren't much of a hassle. However, I found the museum to be a bit overwhelming and it got boring after about half an hour. Some of the exhibits were cool, but others were a bit meh. It's worth a visit if you're into science and nature, but it's not the kind of place you want to spend your whole day at. ",When you visit London you must add on your list this museum
"August 30, 2022","We have spent half day here.We could stay longer as the museum is very big and interesting, but we had another plan for same day as well. When we entered and I saw the entrance I knew I will love this museum. My favourite part was the earth quake room where you can actually feel a strong one...","Too crowded, feel like you're always in someone's way"
"August 29, 2022","I feel a little bad giving it three stars given all of the hard work they do behind the scenes (and how helpful the staff are) but as an overall experience it's quite mediocre.You can't argue with the price (though a donation is always a good idea) but it's quite an uncomfortable experience. It's extremely busy, even on a Sunday, and you always feel like you're in someone's way. Around certain exhibits (e.g. the dinosaur section) it feels more like you're in a flowing river of people rather than a museum you can genuinely engage with.I would advise turning up an hour before they close because it thins out quite a bit then and you can walk straight in and focus on the things you really want to see (like the dinosaur or the whale). I would advise skipping the weaker exhibitions because you aren't going to see anything special (endless numbers of fossils and rocks mostly).Take a bottle and fill up from their water, too. The selection of drinks to buy is quite poor.",Superb!
"August 28, 2022","My favourite museum in London. Superb exhibits which change often. So much to see and do, a day is never enough. This museum is great for whole day experiences or to pop in for a couple of hours. Quite often heavy queues so be aware of peak times. Great museum for children and adults.",Amazing museum suitable for all ages
"August 27, 2022","This museum is huge which I believe one would need to spend more than 3 hours to visit all exhibits. The exhibits are categorized into 4 different zones. I personally love the red zone which is more about geology and planets. Other zones exhibits about the evolution, history and characteristics of dinosaurs, animals, insects, etc. It also got galleries on different stones, materials, gems, etc. The exhibits are interactive and the museum uses various ways to display. It is interesting and educational. Kids surely find it fun and as an adult, I found the presentation is clear, well organized, comprehensive yet easy to digest. The museum itself resembles a traditional British college, kind of Harry Potter type. The bricks, the arches, the stairs, the grand hall, the windows, all combines to make a great piece of architecture.  Good for photo taking of course!",Excellent
"August 27, 2022","Must see, lucky to have such great attractions in the city.Diplo is on rotation and is pretty cool just to stand next to!",Perennial favourite
"August 26, 2022","We always enjoy coming here, despite the crowds. Lots of interesting things to see (especially the dinosaurs and the blue whale!) and a fun time for children and adults.We did not book tickets in advance and had to wait in line outside, as apparently capacity within the museum is capped. We came towards the end of the day, so luckily the line moved quickly.It is quite warm and crowded inside. It's a bit chaotic. Only some of the rooms are air-conditioned.Lots of maps around, so you can easily find what you want to see. Dippy, the famous dinosaur, is temporarily back before going on another UK tour.",Free but busy attraction
"August 26, 2022","It’s great that they still have free entry, but a lot of exhibits need free booking. We went to see the dinosaur Dippy, but there weren’t any tickets left. Would recommend going in the morning as it gets very busy during the school holidays. There was a nice picnic area in the garden and the children’s food boxes at the cafe were priced at £6. It’s easily reachable by tube and a short walk away from Hyde Park.",Crowded disappointed
"August 26, 2022","Visited 23 August, 2022. Travelled from North Yorkshire. We pre booked tickets which was great because we didn’t queue to enter the museum BUT far too many people were in the building. First stop the dinosaurs, it was so cramped that I left the exhibition, my son and his children did stay but it wasn’t a pleasant experience being pushed along by the crowds, no time to read and explore. We had pre booked to see Dippy, but no one managing the number of people visiting so again squashed. In the end my husband and I waited outside while son and his children continued to try and explore. But gave up due to heat and crowds. So disappointing, like many other reviews I felt numbers should be limited to ensure safety and a positive experience, especially if you have booked. A brilliant building and museum we just couldn’t enjoy it on this visit.","Too hot, too crowded!"
"August 25, 2022","Unfortunately, we would echo the recent reviews. This is a fantastic museum but at no point did we feel like engaging with any of the exhibits as the crowds and the heat were unbearable. I would suggest a ticketing system for school holidays to enable the experience to be remotely enjoyable. Weirdly, we were encouraged to book for the museum and Dippy but at no point were our tickets checked 🤷‍♂️On a positive note, a shout out to Captain Charlotte who ran a BRILLIANT ocean dive show which had our two girls captivated. It was creative, informative and a lot of fun. Well done and I hope you get to read this!",Full of old rocks and bones etc.
"August 25, 2022","If you like this kind of stuff you won't need to read my drivel.  It is first class - and it is free, hence the queues the length of the outside of the building.",Patagotitan
"November 20, 2023","First visit for a long time to see the Titanasaur exhibition. Not the best signed exhibition had to ask to find out where it was. However, once there it was very well laid out, the displays before seeing the main exhibit were highly informative and interactive. You suddenly come into the central part and see the enormous skeleton, I especially liked the little fact boxes in the floor. Sadly did not have much time after the exhibition but will be back a lot sooner.",Very Impressive.........
"October 18, 2021","I always wanted to visit this place especially as the Victoria and Albert museum is across the road to here an so if you have 3/4 hours spare it is perfect to visit both and you will not be disappointed, as i wasn't. I briskly walk around an that took me just under 2 hours.The amount of animals/skeletons that are on display here is amazing, obviously, everybody is different an so certain areas of this museum will appeal to different interests. Personally i found the dinosaurs interesting and the section on Earthquakes - there is a interactive Japanese shop which you stand in and it moves, so you get the full experience of what it is like in when an earthquake hits.Ideal for solo or family visits especially if you have children as there are alot of interesting things to see as this is a massive building.There are plenty of amenities with toilets dotted about and places to eat and drink.A big thumbs up - highly recommend a visit to anyone who is thinking of going - just go!, it is free and it is interesting too!",I love this place
"February 23, 2020","This place is amazing!!! You can’t see everything in one day, anyway if you have time only for couple hours it is fine. If you have more time will be amazing.I suggest to plan your visit a few month before, so you can find on website some extra activities as silent disco, yoga... it is an amazing experience!!!!",Extremely busy
"August 4, 2022","This is a great place to visit and Dippy was fantastic to see again! A great free trip out in London that I will more than likely do again.While this was a lovely experience it was damped by the fact that it was so busy that I missed a few displays. You don’t have to book tickets online you can just turn up though it will be a longer wait to get in if you haven’t booked online. Though this is pretty pointless as nobody checks your time-slot so I don’t really understand the point in picking a time. It is also very, very hot throughout. The dinosaur exhibit was unbearable at one point with us all cramped in their so if you are to visit when warm bring lots of water. I went to buy a drink and it was £2.50 for a single can of Diet Coke! However there was a free refillable water station that I and others made the most of.",too many people ruined the experience
"November 21, 2023","The museum in it self is easily 5 stars! But the whole experience is really disappointing. They encourage you to book a time slot for entering, but they let everybody in. There were SO many people that you can’t walk anywhere without bumping in to someone. I love a free museum but would gladly pay if that meant there would be fewer people. we visited on a monday morning. i can’t imagine what it would be like in the weekend. but if you have lots of time and patience it’s an amazing place!",Good day out
"August 13, 2021","It was really busy which meant people were walking in all directions, getting in the way of what you are trying to look at. The museum is great and there’s a lot to see however we didn’t really know which way to go in order to see everything. Food was very expensive.",Yawn
"December 9, 2023","If you like looking at dinosaur bones and stuffed animals, this place will be right up your street. However, I couldn't find a single exhibit that interested me. It's all put together with a lot of thought, but I just found it all incredibly boring. The building itself is beautiful inside and out, and is worth a visit if you love Victorian gothic architecture (which I do).If you're determined to visit, I recommend booking tickets. The queue for the ticket-less was much longer and slower. ","Vast, wonderful, fascinating museum"
"June 15, 2022","I spent from 10 AM to 1:30 PM here but could've spent much more time! I visited on the 1st day back, though in temporary display, for Dippy the Dinosaur. For decades Dippy was in the main hall, then he went on tour & replaced by a whale. I don't understand why the plan is to place Dippy somewhere else that is not in the museum? I ate in a beautiful cafe, a sandwich, and only later found in the more modern wing, there's a cafe with hot food available. Directional signs need to be improved. In the mammal hall, I could not find certain animals, staff later explained those rooms were not then opened, but that was not clear from signs or map.",Dinosnores for Adults
"May 17, 2022","Amazing experience, although had to queue, it was handled well.  They split you into different groups so that you have timings for you to visit the different activities going on and it worked really well..............go team Raptor.It was a fun evening and I even got to see exhibits I had missed before.  Only one downside.............the evening meal.  Aside from being cramped at the tables (a table that was for 8 had 10 people on it) and the slow service, menu choice was poor.   I could have understood if the food choices were for a reason such as sustainability or to encourage everyone to try vegetarian but it was an odd mix............starter Superfood Salad or Tuna Sashimi, main Duck leg, Baked Aubergine or Vegetarian Lasagne and desert (most normal of choices) of either Baked Cheesecake or Drizzle Cake.   Was definitely ready for my breakfast which was lovely and the organisation was much better.Would definitely recommend this once in a lifetime experience.",Not even worth it for free! 
"July 12, 2022","OMG AVOID! Total joke, we booked tickets in advance because it said there was limited access due to covid. When we got there they just waved everyone in, didn't check tickets of anyone. The place was packed like a night club, we couldn't even keep the family together it was so packed. Almost imposible to look at anything. We had to leave or we would lose one of the kids. No covid precautions, nothing. I'm angry.","Great Experience, Great Building, Will go again"
"January 10, 2020","Love the building, packed with dinosaurs, animals, rocks, something for everyone.Eating areas get very busy at lunchtime so would suggest you eat early or late (especially if you need several seats).One of my favourite museums, great bit of culture !",Great Experience !
"November 1, 2023","Natural History Museum is located West side of London’s Heart and few minutes walking from Hyde Park.From there, you can access Kensington Palace (Queen Victoria Birth Place) and Princess Diana’s Memorial.A very important tip is to book online. This is completely free and you will skip the file which can take more than 30mn.The Museum is very big with very nice areas to visit as Dinosaurus places, I ce Era zone or the Mineral exposition.You can do it in 1h00-2h00 depending on how we like it but it gives you very clear and easy to understand explanations about Animal Wild, species classifications….Definitely a visit to include during your stay even with Kids.",INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE
"August 18, 2023","I was in this museum in July and I have to say that its contents are breathtaking. Here we can learn a little about the history of our species as Man, as well as its evolution. It really is a must. Reserve about 3 hours to be able to see everything. Best thing is that it’s free admission",Wonderful museum but too crowded!
"December 9, 2023","Amazing museum, with a great range of exhibits.  It's great that it's free entry, but I'm only giving 4 stars because the wait to enter was unacceptably long, 50 minutes queuing outside.  The dinosaurs section is great, but has always been slightly disappointing ever since Dippy left (you can now see him in Coventry).  The Earth section is also great and a ride up the long escalator into the ""earth"" is a must.  In spite of the crowds, the cafe was remarkably efficient and quick service.  Recommended to book tickets in advance to avoid the queues!!",TOO MANY PEOPLE !
"March 14, 2022","Had booked tickets as website stated no entry without, timeslot was 2.30 and  when arrived the queue outside was huge. No instructions about going to head of queue for admittance as imagined everyone had adhered to the rules!      Tried asking at head of queue and was allowed in with tickets.on entering the building it was heaving with people! This surprised me as not everyone had a ticket surely there where hundreds and hundreds of people. The dinosaur exhibit was a mass of bodies moving forward and at no point would you have been able to actually stop to see the exhibits.it was a more akin to an exodus from a football match!        We gave up and left ,so disappointed that the ticketing system wasn't being used ,seems all rules are off and coming out of a Pandemic I really felt quite uncomfortable. Disappointed  ",Amazing!
"May 6, 2020","I have been to the natural history museum a few times, and each time I have loved it! It is great for any types of trips! eg: family, school, holidays etc. The exhibitions are amazing and really educational. And there is often a limited time exhibition on. I would definitely recommend!","Accessible museum, good variety of exhibitions, 3-4h visit"
"November 6, 2021","Good museum, plenty to keep you busy for 3-4h. Pay entry through donation. Very accessible for people with limited mobility (only 1 room had slightly tricky bumpy floor and there are plenty of lifts, although there could be improvements to the wheelchair accessible toilets). Note that the museum lends wheelchairs if you need one. The exhibition on the future of the planet was interesting, although I feel it just scratches the surface. It is accessible for people with limited previous knowledge, ok to do with kids too. ",Unbearably hot
"October 16, 2022","We were really looking forward to visiting the museum with our 3 children and booked online as advised. We went on a Saturday and it was extremely loud and busy but worst of all it was unbearably hot, so much so that we left after about half an hr. A real shame. I'm sure it's brilliant...sadly impossible to take in under those conditions.",Engaging for even the most restless of children and adults alike
"March 7, 2020","It's also extremely good to hire for a party if you're a company. By day, though, the exhibits are displayed in such a way to really engage everyone, and I can attest to this. It is the antidote for anyone who says that museums are boring, as this is absolutely not.",A Treat for sure!
"February 14, 2020","You'll love this building, and the architecture is a must see.  For anyone new to the museum scene it is a great trip with kids.  Only draw back is once you have been to the Museum of Natural History in NYC, this one waivers a little, but still a beautiful place to see!!",Fabulous Museum
"July 8, 2022",Another wonderful museum in the heart of London. The exhibits are just amazing and it will take a long time to see everything. Bonus for us was that Dippy the dinosaur was paying a short visit so we were able to see him again.,IMG Ice Skating - rather than handing skates out they should be giving wetsuits and snorkels!
"November 2, 2021",Booked to go Ice Skating outside the NHM. Looked very nice in the pictures. On arrival found that the ice was actually one giant cold paddling pool. Please see pictures for how bad it was. Kids falling over and landing in deep water! This all outside and at the end of October. Looks like the ice machine either broken or not fit for service in mild October weather. Woman in ticket office unable to give refund but gave us an email to contact who could. Same story from supervisor in the skating tent. On return home we have contacted the email address and so far no refund. Will fight this as not right to expect kids to try and skate in this depth of water. IMG should have equipment suitable for the job. Or rather than handing skates out they should be giving wetsuits and snorkels! I recommend you don't book and see what its like on the day. This company obviously only cares about its profit and not its customers. If I don't get any further with the skate company will hand over to my credit card company to sort. Would recommend anyone else effected to do the same.,Great with kids
"May 24, 2022","We entered from Exhibition Road, this gave us logical tour throughout the exposition, starting from geology, volcanos etc.. Our tickets at the entrance was checked and people who hadn't prebooked a time was actually sent away. The beginning of out tour was reasonably packed - not too many people, I guess because everybody was looking the dinosaurs, which was crammed. You kind of move there in line. Can't really understand the popularity of that. Also I didn't like the arthropod room, which was mostly pictures and moulages. Overall it was great day with kid. The details of the building itself were amazing.",Disappointing Displays but Amazing Architecture
"April 2, 2023",If you want to see the large special dinosaur exhibition make sure you book it early as it was sold out when we got there. If it wasn’t for the fantastic animal photography exhibition we would have left very disappointed as a lot of the displays were poor (just models rather than taxidermy).  Worth visiting tho just to see the beautiful architecture.,Doesn’t know what it wants to be
"August 28, 2023","I really had mixed feelings about the displays that left me feeling very underwhelmed. I knew about collection highlights and was looking forward to walking around a traditional museum with specimens in cabinets and enjoying the architecture. But the museum is not that. In an effort to be more engaging and draw in families, they have constructed big clunky displays that make the rooms truncated and impossible to comfortably navigated given the numbers that have poured in. You are constantly stuck behind large family groups pouring over some plastic interactive display. While I understand the drive for engagement, it gave the museum a bit of an identity crisis. It felt like it wanted to be a science centre for families and not a natural history museum. To the point where in the dinosaur section, the skeletal casts were in the rafters (almost as an afterthought) which cheap tacky displays ran supreme and a photo opportunity took up considerably exhibition space. Ultimately we left after little over an hour as we didn’t enjoy the majority of the displays and felt harassed and pressed in by the sheer numbers. Staff throughout were lovely, in particular, a very upbeat lady manning the front door (I believe this was on the 29th of July if it helps this feedback get back to her)",Must go with kids
"September 7, 2020","A must go place... and if your kids have interest in dinosaurs then it is top of it... Go on upper floor as well there is butterfly shows and different things hut it has ticket . Otherwise , its free. You can easily spend 3-4 hrs and then you can go for food  to al beruit express for labenese which is walking distance from there and snowflake icecream . Good day out.",FAR too crowded 
"July 28, 2023",So busy we could barely move. We saw more gift shops than exhibits initially. £4 to check a small bag at the cloakroom. A lot of the museum hadn’t changed since at least the 90s but there’s plenty to look at. A bit of an over reliance on taxidermy perhaps? Minecraft obsessed children may enjoy the geology section most. Maybe we’d have a different opinion if we’d gone at a different time but it was like being on a rush hour tube - so crammed you could barely move let alone see anything. Also didn’t appreciate two employees giving us the hard sell ‘voluntary’ donation as we entered. Not the greatest experience and not somewhere we will rush back to.,"Day trip of 12, ages 8-60 to see Dippy"
"June 29, 2022","I would normally have given the NHM a 5. The good parts which the kids age 8-14 liked were the creepy crawlies and the stuffed birds. We went to visit Dippy. Just a shame he couldn't go below the Blue Whale. He seemed a bit confined in the small gallery that he was in. We used the school lunch area as it was a Sunday. Really good as we had a large group of 7 kids and 5 adults. Our only wish was that we couldn't get a coffee or tea and really wanted on!My main problem was the dinosaur gallery. I've been to this gallery loads of times over the years with children. Unfortunately without the gantry being open means that you all feel like you are jammed together and don't really get a good view of the skeletons. Also, the moving T Rex caused a real bottle neck at the beginning. This section was much better when you use to walk in from one side and out the other. One of our group is a high functioning autistic child. He loves dinosaurs but couldn't wait to get out of the gallery because of the layout made him feel like it was closing in on him. He has never had this reaction before on the various visits we've had before.",Free visit but overcrowded
"September 2, 2023","We visited bank holiday weekend (Saturday). Although this is free to visit, It is advised to pre-book your tickets as you will not have to queue. The queue’s were huge. It was very busy and overcrowded and just wasn’t an enjoyable experience. There is three floors to see but we didn’t view all the floors as it was just so busy. For a free day out, its still worth it.",Busy with so much to see; it’s intense!
"January 26, 2023","We began our day with a trip to the museums, starting with this one. Of course, it has A LOT to offer, with so much content, and so much to explore. A lot of the time I walked around thinking what have I missed, which sections didn’t we see because it is quite overwhelming. It was pretty good, so much to see to the point you end up just walking past a lot of it. I think we were here about an hour and a half, and that time did go by quite quickly. The best sections were definitely those on the higher floors, so I’m glad I started there. The dinosaur section was just full of children, which was to be expected, but there was a lot of people in a pretty small space. I imagine it’s be the same any day of the week, but Monday was very intense. It was lovely to look at, I will say, but I doubt I’ll return anytime soon unless there’s a new exhibit that seems interesting.",Not as good as expected 
"April 7, 2023",Went during the Easter school holidays with my children and it was rather disappointing. Thankfully we had booked tickets as without the queue to go in would have been endless.I was expecting it to be busy being the school holidays but this was just too much. We lasted about 1 hr 30 mins before getting too hot and a bit fed up having just really been swept around in crowds unable to see things fully or take in any information. Unfortunately I am limited to school holidays so would not be returning as I would not advise visiting during these times. ,Needs revamping
"January 13, 2023","A lot of the exhibitions are looking a bit tired.  Some were closed.  Very confusing to get around and even on a week day during term time, it is absolutely packed with small children running around and screaming.Nice to see Dippy!!",Dippy the dinosaur is back!
"June 6, 2022","What a perfect way to spend your time with your teens and younger children. Dippy the dinosaur is back! This museum will keep you and your kids very busy as there are so many things to see. My favourite is the mineral, rock, meteorites and ores collection. It's a must see. Love this museum ❤❤❤",Not that good anymore
"August 11, 2021",Been here before 9 years ago and it was way better then. Bit of a disappointment this time and not that interesting anymore. Think they focused too much on the very expensive Fantastic Beasts exhibition. Real shame won't be returning.,Dangerous Ice Skating Rink
"January 4, 2022","I ice skate regularly at our local rink in Chelmsford and my friend and I booked this session as a bit of winter fun. I use the public skates at my local rink so this isn’t me just being snooty about not having good enough skates, but the skates were not sharp at all. This meant you couldn’t cut into the ice making it so slippy and dangerous!! They have a responsibility to their customers and they are falling short. The ice wasn’t also Oreo perky maintained so I saw a lot of falls. Don’t go here. Go to summerset house instead as that is better run and maintained",Got us out of the cold for two hours
"October 27, 2020","I am happy it`s free, If I had paid to go inside I would have been annoyed.The place was a little overwhelming we didn`t really know where to go, even with a map it was pretty confusing- too much going on.So many of the interactive `games` or `experiments` were not working because of covid, maybe they could have them working and just provide sanitiser or a worker to supervise the area.Oh well, got us out of the cold for 2 hours...",Today’s learning.
"February 19, 2020",We made sure we got there early to avoid the queue to get in. We entered from the South Kensington tube. There is a map on sell for £1. It’s your choice how you explore the museum. Unfortunately due to school holidays there was a large number of kids present.,Ticket system is a joke
"April 6, 2023",Don't be fooled by the ticket system. They let anyone in. They didn't check our tickets. We went in at 4.15pm on a Tuesday and it was so packed we couldn't stop to see anything. Imagine walking around in a sea of people and having to wait to view each exhibit. No doubt that this museum is excellent but the sheer volume of people ruined it for us so we won't be back. ,Nice place but zero social distancing
"August 13, 2021",I really like this museum and have been several times over the years two problems this time. that wonderful dinosaur in the middle has been removed and replaced with something weird hanging on the ceiling and I was shocked seeing the crowd in there with zero social distancing I found that appalling and it ruined our day. Our kids wanted to walk through the dinosaur section but we would have literally been climbing over the people to get through makes no sense whatsoever,More Features than we ever imagined. Beautiful building
"January 11, 2020",This is a must see attraction in London. For locals and visitors alike. We have been many times before and have found it to be a different kind of experience. Each time. Thanks to the hard working individuals who have been putting in much effort and time. Volunteers and paid staff alike. Thank you,Mornings recommended
"July 26, 2023",Visited 21th of july. A long line got in fairly fast. I checked the dinosaurs first since I expected them to get crowded sooner or later. In about half an hour it started raining at the crowds came in. Good thing I was already out exploring the other exhibitions. Overall the museum was great.,A must for children and adults!
"May 4, 2020",Been a few years since I visited the Natural History Museum and it’s still a fascinating place. Good to see the massive blue whale skeleton was still there and the dinosaur area is a big hit with kids. Suggested donations at the entrance but it’s still free if you like.,wide range of exhibits
"July 31, 2023",The museum is fantastic with a wide range of exhibits. You'll need about 3-4 hours to see everything. It's essential to book your tickets online and select your visit day and time to avoid long queues.,Visit was a hit but........
"May 15, 2022","No booking checks on arrival so didn't need to book an entry time. Some of the exhibits were taken off display for conservation.Very busy and a lot of the large exhibits needed a good dusting.Only saw hand sanitiser at the entrance and nowhere else.Still impressive in a wonderful building and kids were enthralled, so overall it was a hit.",Avoid!!
"May 28, 2022","Horrendous experience never to be repeated. Like many others it seems this place left us fingers totally underwhelmed and overwhelmed at the same time. The crowds were unbelievable. I can't see how when there is a booking system in place? It was difficult finding the exhibits. We seemed to walk around for an hour without seeing anything of note. It was hot-, stuffy and very noisy. We will not return. ",Overcrowded
"February 17, 2020","Made the mistake of visiting in a Saturday afternoon. Queued in the rain to get in. Inside it was heaving with people. Couldn't take very much of it as the crowds were too large, so stayed only about one hour. If you are going to go, go during the week when maybe there will be less people and especially less children.",Dont visit on a summer day - No air conditioning
"June 18, 2022","Hot Stuff Crowded.  No air conditioning rude staff and dated exhibitions.Went to see Dippy, what a disappointment!.  Had a ask at the information desk as to exactly where this famous dinosaur was located, as there was no signs anywhere.What a shock when finally located.  stuck in a side room, with multi coloured lights flashing on and off it.No where as re,emembered when it was in the main entrance hall.Museum not exactly disabled friendly steep steps everywhere inside.",Go at a quieter time
"August 24, 2022","The museum itself is lovely, there is a lot to see and do. Unfortunately we didn't get to see hardly any of it as it was unbelievably busy. A lot of the time it was like herd mentality, we were just getting pushed along with the crowd not being able to stop to properly read anything or take it in. ",Visit
"July 24, 2022",It was amazing experience. One of the most beautiful building I have ever visited. I totally adore tiny little details of the museum building. Also exhibitions were really interesting. The one and only fault was The number of visitors. I think they could regulate it for better experience.,Great Museum
"January 31, 2020","My wife and I absolutely loved the architecture of this musuem....it's incredible. As far as the actual displays at the museum, very interesting and well presented for the most part. We were disappointed how small and awkardly positioned the dinossaur section is. Quite smaller and less developed than the one in the American Museum of Natural History in New Work. Overall however, the museum is great and it's a fun way to spend a few hours with your family. Kids seem to really enjoy it as well.","Vast, Impressive and Overwhelming - from the entrance walk through the architecture and each and every detailed exhibit."
"March 23, 2023","Wonderful. Overwhelming! I spent a very quick 2.5 hrs there and barely made it past the massive jewel and mineral displays! I confess to being a bit spoiled as we live a stone’s throw from the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, but from the entrance onward, London’s NHM holds its own and more. Plan to on my next visit!",Worth a visit but...
"January 26, 2020",Travelling alone with 4 year old girl. I made a bee line for here. It was really good and she enjoyed it. We whizzed through a lot of it and she was enjoying it but was not massively blown away. I would recommend going though. Took about 2 hours of the day. TRex Grill. Massive let down. Got my daughter's order wrong three times. Staff too busy chatting tbh. Portion size good and cost was alright but staff annoyed me tbh. Been there and done it now. Deffo worth a visit though with 4 year old but don't make it the wow factor highlight of your trip.,Wildlife photographer of the year exposition
"June 4, 2021","Always a pleasure to visit this museum, even with the current conditions. We went there with my daughter to see the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exposition and it was a great experience.First, the safety was really taken care seriously which is obviously essential today. Despite the location of the exposition was not really clear from the entrance (this hall is always so overwhelming by its size and beauty!), staff was very helpful and friendly so we made our way to it relatively easily.The ambiance was very nice and photos were beautiful, impressive and some what disturbing on the ""journalism"" part of the expo about what humans can unfortunately do to nature and animals.All the photographies were impressive in their way and it was very difficult to determine which ones would be the winner... it is so subjective to everyone sensibility, despite the techiaues and the work involved behind the photo itself.Great experience anyway which recall if necessary the beauty of our planet and creatures living on it.","If you love crowds and rush-hours tube like vibe, go for it."
"May 1, 2023",What happened to this once lovely and charming museums? Incredibly crowded and hot. I felt like fainting the entire time we navigated the narrow corridors seeing nothing but other people. The suspended catwalk that allowed for a close look at the dinosaurs is now closed and all is left is to look at them from below. I felt incredibly overwhelmed and worried about the safety of my 4 years old possibly getting lost or hurt. We will mot return to this museum.,"Overcrowded, lots of pushing and shoving"
"April 26, 2023","The exhibitions were interesting, the only downside was you couldn’t enjoy them! The museum lets in far too many people. There is an online booking service but that doesn’t cap the amount of people. I spent my whole day being shoved and pushed out the way. We came from Australia and were disappointed with how little time we had to look at exhibits. Disappointing trip",Incredible museum for kids.
"March 12, 2023","I brought my kids to this place and we had a wonderful time. The exhibits were a hit with the kids, especially the dinosaurs. However, it can be quite crowded with school groups, and the layout can be a bit challenging to navigate. Despite these minor issues, I would still highly recommend this place as a must-visit destination for kids.",Great museum in a great building
"July 26, 2023","The museum is located in a great building. The entrance hall is huge and very impressive. This by itself makes it already worthwhile the visit. There is no charge at the door, but they do ask for a donation. For special exhibitions they do charge you extra. To get around you will need some time. They have the biggest gem stone collection I have ever seen, but also the other departments are very impressive",Amazing
"December 16, 2022",Me n my husband went to eat something From the Kitchen which is inside the history museum and david one of their member helped us enormously and we just wanna say thanks a lot David from the kitchen from me n my husband . You are so kind and lovely and made us feel so comfortable and happy.Grace joy,Awesome. 
"January 23, 2020",My second visit and just one of the most beautiful museums you will ever visit. It's free entry with queuing times non existent during the week but long on weekends. Worth a visit alone just to look up at Dippy in the great hall. ,Fascinating museum
"April 30, 2023","This is undoubtedly one of the greatest museums in UK and a real must-see in London. Dinosaurs, volcanoes, minerals, animals, earthquakes, there is all of this and much more. On top of that the building itself is wonderful. Natural History Museum is a real gem, worth seeing.",Professional and very kind manager
"January 27, 2023","I am really impressed by the professionalism of the manager at the entrance. I was visiting the museum with a group of students, and he quickly and kindly solved our problem. Unfortunately, I don’t remember his name, but I would like to thank him very much once more. The museum is amazing and we really enjoyed our visit.",Ridiculously crowded
"May 1, 2022","Unfortunately it’s impossible to comment on the exhibits because they allowed so many people in, there was not an opportunity to look at anything for more than a second, let alone ready anything or learn anything. The amount of people they allowed into the dinosaur exhibition was unsafe, it was like trying to escape a packed concert, I’m amazed their risk assessments allow such huge volumes because it’s a disaster waiting to happen. Such a shame, because I’m sure if we had been able to see anything it would have been great.",A fantastic day out with the kids!
"October 16, 2021","There is so much to see and there is something to interest everyone.  The dinosaurs were a big hit and so was the Earths treasury, volcanoes and earth quakes area, especially all of the interactive parts including the earthquake.  Lots of things learnt on this trip, was very interesting., building itself is absolutely beautiful too. There were lots of little seating areas where you could rest for 5 minutes before moving on, plenty of toilet facilities and a few eating outlets as well as vending machines for drinks dotted around.",Awful Visit
"August 17, 2023","Visited on 15th August, It was so busy that it was dangerous. Couldn’t see a lot because of it being too crowed. Also it was so hot in there we only managed the dinosaurs quickly. Think we were there for about 1 hour until we gave up. Luckily we booked tickets so queueing wasn’t a problem.NHM need to put something in place to limit the numbers.",Looked great but very busy
"February 4, 2020",Visited here on the 1st Feb (saturday) and it was crazy busy. It was just a river of people in the Dino section. You could not even try and stop to look at anything as yu would be crushed in the stampede.If you could get a day where it was not so busy then it would be a great place to visit.Settled for the Earth stuff and this kept us entertained.,Very instructive visit on a busy Sunday morning
"February 13, 2020","I visited with my 2 teens daughters the Natural History Museum on a cold Sunday morning. The museum, which entrance is free, was crowded. My daughters loved the visit - the dinosaurs part or the science / biology part. They even wished they could spend at least an extra day there...",Behind the scenes tour
"March 3, 2020",When I went in to the museum I saw they had a behind the scenes tour. Booked a spot for the tour starting in an hour on my phone very easily with no issues what so ever. The tour was a fascinating experience and as someone who studied science at uni I found the tour deep into the bowels of the labs and private collection fascinating. Our guide was fantastic and easily answered all of our weird and wonderful questions. I loved seeing some of Charles Darwin’s private specimens. This institution really is a cathedral of science and nature!,"Too busy, avoid "
"February 20, 2023","Way too busy, no effort to control crowd size and prevent over crowding. We booked time ticket entry but even so we were rammed in. It was like being at a rugby or football final. Couldn't read anything or stop to look at anything as it was a constant flow or people all packed together pushing and bumping. Loved this museum in the past but had to give up. Unenjoyable experience. I even had doubts around safety if there was a fire or any kind of panic",Love IT!
"August 4, 2022","I love this museum! There is so much to see,  make sure you do a full day there. Children will love exploring, it is educational and fun! Bring your own food as a bit pricey. Be ready to que if need be. ",When dinosaurs ruled the Earth
"June 3, 2020","The Natural History Museum in London is a gem of history. It's an absolutely remarkable thing to see ages of history timeline compressed in a single place. It takes hours to see every exhibit in detail. I was fascinated by what is left of dinosaurs -  small tokens of what in the past was an animal kingdom. In an evolutionary sense, is like reading a book through images. This place is like a ""Mecca of knowledge"" , it holds a sparkle of knowledge.I recommend it to all of you.",Great few hours out. 
"January 6, 2020",On arrival at the museum the queue was long but moved fast. It was very crowded and we were told that it’s normal for school holidays. My son absolutely loved the dinosaur exhibits. The architecture is absolutely stunning. Well worth the visit if you have a dinosaur obsessed kid like mine. ,Got bored!
"January 14, 2022","Yes i have been many times before over the years and really enjoyed it, but this time i was bored and i'm not sure why.Was it the fact that you wore facemasks or that many exhibits looking tired now or something else, I don't know. We only stayed for less than 2 hours including half hour in cafe.  ",Holiday visit 
"September 4, 2023","Pre booked free tickets, thank god as queue was around the block and the same when we left, we just went straight to the front and in . Went upstairs first which was the boring bit, all rocks , earth, space etc, we missed a lot out as my son was only really interested in the rest. Spent 2 hrs, was far too busy with people but managed to see what we wanted, dinosaur part the best, didn’t pay extra to see the touring dinosaur which I personally think should be free but there you go. He enjoyed the animals etc. would we go again, no, would we have been happy if we had to pay, no, slot of stuff of no interest and just too many people squashed inside!!!!",Like a war zone :( dangerous
"August 17, 2022","The NHM is aware of COVID right? And that right now there is an amber warning for heat?!There were people panicking trying to get out of the dinosaur exhibition, I had to half carry half drag my daughter out of there through an emergency exit (which I got told off for), because she was fainting. It WAS an emergency, if she’s gone down she would have been trampled!Kids were being pushed out the way of adults and it was just appalling. I’m going to send an email to the H&S exec as this is just dangerous. Totally ruined our trip to London :(",Wonderful! Just need more crowd control in some areas
"August 19, 2021",Beautiful building with loads to see and learn! A great time had by all! Seeing our dinosaur mad sons face light up was just such a beautiful thing. We loved it! My only negative point is that the dinosaur part and mammals should have been better controlled especially at the moment. It was very over crowded and that made me feel very uneasy. People pushing past and ontop of eachotherThe rest was absolutely fine,Wau!
"February 15, 2020","I can't believe it's free access, so much to see!  I strongly recommend you to visit and experience.  we were on a rainy day and there were more people than normal but it didn't bother because the place was so big.  it's worth taking the time to see everything, because there's a lot of it.",Not enjoyable
"August 23, 2022","Some very interesting pieces of history. However there was far too many people and the heat was unbearable. We booked tickets for the Dippy exhibit but these weren't being checked so it was a free for all. Its a shame they try and get as many people in as possible to get them to spend money in the restaurants, cafes and shops.... ruins the experience. They also need to limit the numbers and install some air conditioning or ventilation. I know its free but would rather pay in to be able to enjoy it.",Weekday visit 
"May 12, 2023",It was packed with hordes of schoolchildren and  very hot inside the main hall. The noise was also loud and nowhere comfortable for an elderly person to sit and rest. I decided to abort my visit as it was so packed and uncomfortable.,Visit ruined by far too many people!!
"February 18, 2022","Visited on 17 Feb. Massive queues outside to both entrances. The front entrance seemed a better way in than queuing at the side. Passed 2 kids trying to kick a pigeon upon entry to the grounds (with parents?!) Absolutely cram packed full of people which made it impossible to enjoy anything. Hot and busy. Cafe had tables practically on top of tables to get more people in. Can of coke 2.35!! Scone & hot drink deal £5.50. Scone was dry. Beautiful building and entrance but completely ruined by screaming kids, queues inside and outside, how busy it was and the heat! Don’t go if you’re worried about covid no masks and absolutely no social distancing!! We did book on line and staff were shouting at the front that there were no available tickets for the day.",Amazing displays of dinosaurs & animals
"February 11, 2020",Family with young kids would love this Museum. Amazing displays & informative boards for kids & adults alike. Huge place.Fabulous gift shop too! So much to see & learn about...,Above and beyond
"July 27, 2023",Genuinely can’t thank the NHM staff enough! Took my 5yr old there who had found a “dinosaur bone” on the beach the week before…. Not only did I want to throw it away but already had and elaborate scheme to say it had gone.We got the the info desk and they took the bone and made my son feel like a superstar for finding it! He had the time of his life! It’s worth buying the £11 pack for kids as his got a VIP lanyard and gift bagThe fact that this place is free is crazy as it is a fantastic journey through time in a spectacularly mesmerising setting.A phenomenal place with fantastic people,Wonderful place to spend a day at!
"February 26, 2023","The place had tons of interesting exhibits.  The only problem was there were lots of school field trips the day we visited, therefore it was crowded with kids.  Sadly not able to visit the Sir David Attenborough studio (closed to public, open to student/class pre-bookings only), I would have loved to see this as I'm a fan of his TV series/shows.",Lovely afternoon out
"February 26, 2023","Helpful staff, greeted on arrival, organised well.The food court However was chaotic… could do with moving the fridges or roping them off as I witnessed people taking things an walking away without paying!!",A couple of hours in the museum
"January 5, 2023","Excellent museum for children. The different zones mean that you can pick and choose what you want to focus on. It was really busy when we went so the younger members of the group could get a bit overwhelmed at times but the exhibits were accessible, informative and enjoyable. We all learnt something from our visit!",Really good!
"September 5, 2020","With the social distancing had to book in advance to get a slot. Quite alot of exhibits closed or open but not fully,but to be expected. Social distancing was good generally. Such a great place to visit. The building is stunning from the outside and so interesting inside. The T-Rex is iconic to see when visiting! Some cafes and gift shops open. Really enjoyed",An enjoyable 2 hours
"June 1, 2023",Easy to book in advance and admission was straightforward despite being very busy. You have to expect it is going to be busy during school holidays but it was still possible to get close to things of interest. The young children in our group enjoyed the dinosaurs and the earthquake simulation. My main criticism is there are too many small gift shops and interactive sections. Too many models and not enough of the real artefacts. It’s free though so it is value for money!,Personal Favourite
"August 22, 2022","This is my personal must whenever I'm in London. It's free and fantastically curated. This time over, I went to see Dippy the diplodocus, which is ""back home"" from its tour, and had a walk down the dinosaur gallery.At the moment, tickets are free, but these days it's better to book them online.",Absolutely fabulous well worth a visit
"January 15, 2023",Absolutely fantastic what a brilliant way to spend the day kept the teens and the adults engaged. Free entry however you do need to book online. Really enjoyed the exhibits. The earth and volcano exhibit was great the escalator ride was a little hairy - very high for the faint hearted. So much information to take in and digest you need quite a few hours to see everything.  We stopped half way in the cafe for some lunch which was yum! There are other restaurants within the museum.,Perennial favourite
"August 26, 2022","We always enjoy coming here, despite the crowds. Lots of interesting things to see (especially the dinosaurs and the blue whale!) and a fun time for children and adults.We did not book tickets in advance and had to wait in line outside, as apparently capacity within the museum is capped. We came towards the end of the day, so luckily the line moved quickly.It is quite warm and crowded inside. It's a bit chaotic. Only some of the rooms are air-conditioned.Lots of maps around, so you can easily find what you want to see. Dippy, the famous dinosaur, is temporarily back before going on another UK tour.",Worth Visiting
"November 17, 2022",We had a wonderful visit here. Dippy was impressive and we were lucky there wasn’t a long queue.  Sophie was also well worth visiting.The missus liked the human evolution exhibit while I enjoyed the gift shop - ended up buying a few gifts.It is definitely worth spending a couple of hours here.,It’s ok
"February 17, 2022","It’s Alright, once you’ve seen one Dino bone you’ve seen them all. Once you’ve seen one flourite crystal, you’ve seen em all. The big blue Topaz was stunning and the Giant Sequoia are worth seeing.",Well organised but avoid weekends!
"May 7, 2022","I went to see the Wildlife Photographer of the Year  which was just outstanding.  I try and go every year if I am in London.  This is a paid exhibition.  I made the silly mistake of booking for a Saturday afternoon.  The museum was super busy!  If you can avoid it and don't have children, then go at a quieter time!  The exhibition was really well laid out and easy to follow. Clean.  Loved it.  Staff were  pleasant and friendly.  Despite them trying to manage numbers with the ongoing C-19 pandemic, it was still super busy!  ",Multiple visits
"November 11, 2022","We regularly visit this museum. It is for us the jewel in the crown. So much to see one visit is simply not enough. I first visited as a child, have visited many times as a parent and now visit just for my own pleasure. I have visited the NYC Natural History Museum which is hugely disappointing comparatively. If your in London it's the no.1 thing to do.",Well worth a visit
"April 8, 2023","Please do visit, it was a great experience, we stayed for 5 hours!Some of the exhebitions are a bit dull, relaying on plaster replicas of animals, where as others are great, especially the display of birds. A bit sad that the garden is not open at this time, as it is being remodelled, and I would have liked a gallery on plants, maybe there were some that we just missed. ",Spoilt by its own success.
"August 4, 2022","It's just too busy to enjoy, and we were there on a day with no queue to get in.Also the dinosaur exhibit is completely shut currently. Not much fun. I'd recommend the Science Museum next door as a much better alternative for kids or adults.",Wildlife Photographer of the Year
"May 15, 2023","We went for the Wildlife Photographer of the Year with an 11 year old. We thought it was very good but she was bored there was nothing that we could see the interacts with kids. We also spent time in the Dinosaur room, which was great. The photography we have been before a few years back and thought this time lacked a wow factor. I would say its good to go every few years The Dinosaur exhibition I personally would have liked to see more real fossils and not models.",Dinosnores 
"October 30, 2023",I attended dinosnores with my sister and best friend. I've been wanting to go for years and finally a big birthday gave me the excuse! It was a fantastic experience. The staff were great and clearly put a lot of effort into the night. A special mention to the compare who was great! The food was surprisingly good for a large catered event. We enjoyed the animal meet and great and the quiz. The best of all was getting to roam around the museum at night. The harpist was a lovely touch to finish off the night. It was great to spend a bit of time in the morning in the titanosaur exhibition and gift shop. I'd recommend getting there early and waiting outside. We were near the front of the queue and had first pick of sleeping area,A great museum!
"February 19, 2022","We visited with our 9yr old daughter who is obsessed with dinosaurs, so this is THE place to go! Stunning building, well laid out, loads to see and do. Yes it was busy but that’s to be expected. It didn’t spoil anything having to queue for a few minutes now and then. Already looking forward to returning.",An Awesome Place that needs so TLC
"November 17, 2023",Still an amazing and iconic facility. It is beyond overwhelming and would tak days to see in it's entirety. My only criticism is that it looks like the maintenacne and cleanming have been neglected for quite some time. There is a lot of work required to clean it up and restore the aging displays and signage etc.,Great place to come.
"November 13, 2022",As I was in London I thought I’d visit the museum. It’s very good and lots to see. My daughter who is 13 really liked it too. Just make sure to get a map as twice we thought we’d seen it all only to find another “hidden” room etc.,Wow what a place.  Absolutely fantastic!!
"March 20, 2022","Went for the day and did the out of hours dino tour before general admission.  Our tour guide was fantastic and very knowlegable and we were the only ones in the museum.  We then explored and spent 7 hours in the museum.  It was absolutely brilliant and we feel privileged to have been to such a fantastic place.  Beautiful architecture, wonderful exhibits. Long may it continue and we will be back. ",Excellent day out 
"January 4, 2020","We visited The Natural History Museum yesterday. We queued for about 20 minutes to get in. It’s a very large place, with lots to see and do. There’s a lot of information on dinosaurs. There’s a lift up to the red zone where you can learn about earthquakes.There’s a creepy crawly section.",Fantastic
"February 10, 2020","Spent hours at the natural history museum, it was brilliant! So many interesting things to look at and learn about. The dinosaur section was really great. Lots of school trips there, but it didn’t interfere with our visit to much, just very noisy. Would definitely recommend a visit and it’s free o charge.",Excellent Museum
"July 7, 2021","The last time I went to the NHM was a school trip some 45ish years ago and it was superb. We had a great time and the dinosaurs and blue whale were my favourite. Very busy with lots of children with their families despite it being school term which was surprising, remember you need to book.",Brilliant
"October 4, 2021",It’s free!!! I’m not sure what people are meaning about. I was heart broken when I realised I forgot to book and my son was sooooo upset. After looking online again we took the risk to tube it and walk ( as the nearest station was closed ) 😤 and we were not disappointed.  We walked straight in. The staff were amazing they sang happy birthday to my daughter and my son and I go is dinosaur mad was proper made up. Much made my day. It’s free so enjoy it for what it is.,Brilliant
"February 9, 2020",Went with family today. So much to see and learn for the children but also learn ourselves.Favourite part has to be the dinosaur exhibit for us but everything was still great to see too.Restaurant is slightly pricey but we took our own lunch.. Definitely worth the trip,My favourite museum 
"March 8, 2020","The national history museum is my favourite museum ever! It's such a gorgeous building from the exterior but the interior blows you away. The museum is filled with so much history, it's such a delight. Plus the fact it's free means you can have an exciting day out for literally NOTHING. I highly recommend this place if and when travelling to London. Seek the excitement in this stunning museum. ",Very confusing layout
"January 17, 2023","Signs need rethinking especially if your not coming in from the main entrance,  the zones (colour) don’t really match with what the signs say and the toilets are nowhere near where the signs say.  Even the staff where confused.  A lot of walking around on tired feet and getting annoyed.  Spoilt the experience.  What we did see we enjoyed though.  ",Best Museum Ever!!!
"January 21, 2020","This is the best museum I’ve ever been to! It’s free, we paid £2/coat in the cloakroom. £1 for kids. £5 for a kids book which we used as a map. Use the cloakroom because we spent 5 hours in this amazing place, could’ve spent 6. Fantastic for kids!!",So much to see
"July 14, 2022","We only had a couple of hours to spare, but just going in to see the building itself is worth it! Amazing details built in.  We just had a quick walk round to see Dippy again, 48 years since I last saw him at the museum. We looked at the minerals room to see the cabinets as they were in the museum back in the 1800’s.  Who knew there were so many different ones and the Vault had some amazing contents. We could spend a day there no problem if it was nearer for us to get there.",This is a wonderful place to visit
"March 27, 2022","The animatronics  are really amazing - makes the dinos look real. Its a great learning experience for children. We went to it as the V & A Museum ended up being closed that day and this is right next to it. Had not had it on our list of things to do, but we are sure glad we went and we will go back again",You can't go wrong with free entry. Fantastic way to spend a few hours.
"March 26, 2022","a month agoIconic London museum which is a must see for the whole family.This stunning building houses a natural history collection dating back billions of years. It's a huge place with many different sections and it's very difficult to do the whole thing in one go. It's free though and you can come back again.Dinosaurs, human evolution, volcano and earthquake zones are just some of the things to see and enjoy. With a number of cafes, plenty of bathrooms and gift shops, there is something for everyone. The architecture of the actual museum is beautiful and we had an amazing time.",First Visit
"March 21, 2022",I visited with my 8 year old nephew with additional needs.To my amazement we managed to stay for almost 3 hours (including lunch) despite his very short attention span. We had a great visit although not sure we saw everything as he was getting a little bored. He has even said he will come back!,So much to see
"March 21, 2022","We prebooked online around lunchtime on a saturday and despite Storm Eunice being in full effect there was still a large walk up queue outside, so booking is essential.First of all the building in itself is an impressive structure and really sets the tone for a great visit.  There are plenty of staff to direct people and scanning of tickets and brochure vouchers was quick.  There's no real route around the museum as far as I could tell so a map is a definite requirement so you don't miss a thing.  The dinosaurs are the big attraction and that area gets very busy, so maybe go there early/late depending on your entry time.  When we went a certain section (mammals) was closed which was disappointing but things have to be maintained so is to be expected from time to time.I would estimate we spent three hours there, we are particularly fast walkers though, but didn't miss any exhibitsIt really is amazing that we have such fantastic museums available for free (although donations should be given) and its great to see so many people using them.  A huge recommend as one of the highlights of visiting London.",Wow what a place.  Absolutely fantastic!!
"March 20, 2022","Went for the day and did the out of hours dino tour before general admission.  Our tour guide was fantastic and very knowlegable and we were the only ones in the museum.  We then explored and spent 7 hours in the museum.  It was absolutely brilliant and we feel privileged to have been to such a fantastic place.  Beautiful architecture, wonderful exhibits. Long may it continue and we will be back. ","Dinosaurs lacking, Temporary Environmental Exhibition a Let Down"
"March 19, 2022","It's hard to knock a museum as impressive as this and also discredit the fact that it was free. But, I can't give it a full 5 mark rating in good conscience. The dinosaur exhibit wasn't all that impressive. I've seen better ones with better organization in museums with less cultural clout. Additionally, I kept seeing hype for their exhibit on ""Broken Earth"" which I was really looking forward to. It was a huge let down, providing no real new information or inviting exhibition pieces. Mostly, just the same song and dance as everywhere else.",Amazing!
"March 18, 2022","I knew this place was big but not THAT big!! The building itself is just bloody beautiful,victorian artictecture at it's finest.We didn't get to see all of the exhibits but what we did see was fantastic,you need to get there early and spend the best part of a day there to really appreciate it there's just so much to see.I felt very humbled and a little ashamed at what we have done(and are doing) to this beautiful planet and I'm no Greta Turnberg fan!",Expected more
"March 16, 2022",I have been in many museums and this one has been praised with good reviews so much that I possible expected too much. The entrance hall with the blue wale and the building itself is fantastic. But the exhibitions are ok. ,TOO MANY PEOPLE !
"March 14, 2022","Had booked tickets as website stated no entry without, timeslot was 2.30 and  when arrived the queue outside was huge. No instructions about going to head of queue for admittance as imagined everyone had adhered to the rules!      Tried asking at head of queue and was allowed in with tickets.on entering the building it was heaving with people! This surprised me as not everyone had a ticket surely there where hundreds and hundreds of people. The dinosaur exhibit was a mass of bodies moving forward and at no point would you have been able to actually stop to see the exhibits.it was a more akin to an exodus from a football match!        We gave up and left ,so disappointed that the ticketing system wasn't being used ,seems all rules are off and coming out of a Pandemic I really felt quite uncomfortable. Disappointed  ",Photography Exhibit 
"March 14, 2022",Went to see the Wildlife Photography Exhbition. I usually love this exhibition but to be honest this time it didn't blow me away. It seemed like a much smaller exhibition without much to see. Not worth nearly £20. The Natural History Museum was heaving at 10am on a Sunday morning but well organised. ,Just WOW!!!
"April 16, 2022",The museum was the most unreal place I have ever been. It was great to see it so busy and things back to normal. My son loves dinosaurs but he loves whales too so we were amazed when we saw them also. Fascinating place and the building itself is stunning. Free entry just ask for donation. A breathtaking experience.,When you visit London you must add on your list this museum
"August 30, 2022","We have spent half day here.We could stay longer as the museum is very big and interesting, but we had another plan for same day as well. When we entered and I saw the entrance I knew I will love this museum. My favourite part was the earth quake room where you can actually feel a strong one...",Amazing and Historic
"January 6, 2020",An amazing Museum with a lot to learn from History. 20 minutes walk from the Earls Court tube station. It was packed with a lot of groups and the whole atmosphere was great. Its so amazing to see ancient history kept such an organised way. Great time we had,Pre book tickets
"February 8, 2023",Was a quick flying visit as we hadn’t realised as to how long it would take to get in as the queues were quite long. We just assumed it was free so didn’t need any although maybe if we Gad planned the visit beforehand then we could have spent more time there.Very busy although very interesting and what a fantastic building! Loved the blue whale Skelton,Absolute Dollop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"September 19, 2021","If pseudo science, fake evolution and fake dinosaurs is your thing - then knock yourself out.From monkey-man to over grown lizards this veritable feast of nonsense is sure to whet the appetite of those who prefer to be given their history rather than researching it.The minute I  walked in the door I couldn't wait to leave. Starting with 'Human Evolution', if you believe you used to be a fish (or whatever) then turned into some kind of chimp.  Then you are right at home in the museum.After a couple of fake dinosaurs I got so bored I'd rather catch  COVID.  No such luck.",A great day out
"January 19, 2020","I have been coming here for some years and there is a lot to see and do at this musuem. The entrance to the musuem is free. You will also find several good cafes here serving a good selection of hot and cold foods, drinks and cakes.",Well worth a visit
"January 8, 2020",Really great time. Hadn’t been for many many years. Free or donation - great value . Many interactive exhibitions to keep all ages entertained. Well worth a visit.,Enjoyed
"August 2, 2021","The museum was big and there was plenty to see (we did not see it all).  Enjoyed the red zone, saw most of the blue zone and a little bit of the green zone.  Would have stayed longer, but it was a very hot day.",Not as good as I remember 
"February 3, 2020","We visited here for the first time in an awfully long time. We both felt it was not as good as we remembered it. Cannot put a finger on it, but somehow a couple of stuffed animals and a few bones looked tired. Also, there is a lot more opportunity to buy dinosaurs stuffed with recycled plastic bottles, than there used to be. Feel it needs to modernise.",Lots to see for free
"November 25, 2022",Wet miserable morning so where better a place to visit than the Natural History Museum. The staff were very helpful and we didn’t have to queue to see Dippy! It was a weekday and we were there for opening. Started to get busy after we’d been there for a while but all in all a nice morning looking around the exhibits.,Shame not alot to do 
"August 12, 2020","Been many times and loved it, however and only because of covid this time sucked, understandable a lot is closed due to covid and everything else seems rushed. Its hard to social distance, especially the dinosaur and its very small now to view it as the raised platform is not in use. At the moment I would give it a miss just because I know how fun and good it can be, that's not take anything away from the staff who clearly have worked very hard to even get it to this stage, I will come back but when hopefully things are more settled ",Outstanding pictures
"July 7, 2023",Went to the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition. Outstanding photography by children and adults in some unusual situations. Each backlit photo was accompanied by the name land country of residence of the photographer together with details of the camera and settings used as well as information on the actual picture. Well displayed  and extremely interesting,Wish the dinosaur had taken some adults for lunch.
"July 19, 2021",They need to work out a way to have adults only times. The whole place was like a giant crèche. I dread to think what it will be like over the 6 weeks summer holiday. I have no problem with kids needing to learn but there was no learning going on. Mums were mostly on the phone.,"Lots to see, nice way to spend a morning"
"June 4, 2023","Went by myself, it was half term so very busy, not sure if it's always so busy.  Great morning though, went round each area, Hope was magnificent this was my favourite part the hall was beautiful, but loved the animated dinosaurs too.  Tried out the earthquake simulation too which was fine but wished it lasted longer.  Was going to have food there but was very busy and the gift shop was very expensive, but other than that great way to spend a morning.",Amazing!
"July 6, 2021","Wonderful experience, so much to see. Stunning building with excellent exhibits. On entry you can buy a map for £1.00 explaining all the zones, which is easy to follow to ensure you capture all that is on offer. The blue zone was a real highlight, great for all the family. Highly recommend a visit.","Slow down, and take it all in, especially the story boards about Mary Anning "
"October 24, 2023","I found a day on my own, and spent half of it touring this Victorian wonder.  As a geologist, I was happy to be there all alone to slowly walk through the different halls and exhibits.  I particularly liked how history was corrected, and Mary Anning was given the special recognition of her discoveries and talent, which were buried for more than a 100 years.  I also really enjoyed viewing the large specimen room, and particularly the asbestos minerals.  As an asbestos abatement manager, I will use photos of these perfect specimens in my training presentations.",Forever in awe
"March 6, 2020",First time visiting and it won’t be the last. There is so much to see it can’t be done in one day. You get a real sense of scale as to the size of some of these amazing creatures in relation to yourself as well as your place in the natural world. I will forever be in awe of this incredible place.,Best place in London
"February 10, 2020","A true heaven for a Geologist and a science estimator. Minerals and fossils collections are huge. If sciences are your thing, plan a full day to visit it. The shop is really nice to visit as well and there are a few spots for food and beverage.",Ditch the animatronics
"August 13, 2022","It was ok. Very hot, but plenty of places to buy drinks and to take a rest. I wanted to see more exhibits instead of info boards and gimmicks. The animatronics took up space that could have been given over to more exhibits. Felt a bit too like a theme park, not a museum.",Iconic London!
"July 2, 2023","A London classic! I brought my cousin here, as it was her first time in London and she was thoroughly impressed.  The main hall with Hope the Blue Whale is just so stunning and beautiful!  The exhibits were well done and interesting and the large gift shop had a lot of neat souvenirs to bring home.  This is my favorite London museum and I will always go back when in town.",great 
"August 19, 2019","Great for adults and kids.I feel like this is more aimed at children with lots of toy shops and Lego shops etc. but we enjoyed it, shows a life size model of a whale. we enjoyed to see all the rare animals we didn’t even new existed and the space and volcano part. ",Interesting and educational - and it’s free!
"September 18, 2016","We visited the Natural History Museum in South Kensington and like other publicly funded national museums in the United Kingdom, this museum does not charge an admission fee. The building itself is absolutely magnificent; a stunning piece of architecture with wonderful ornate carvings of animals built into it.Everything relating to living or extinct natural objects is housed inside this museum.  You can see anything from the fossilised bones of a gigantic dinosaur to a diminutive flea. It was enlightening to see how huge the dinosaurs were and the blue whale was gigantic.The museum was very busy when we visited but I suppose it is understandable considering it’s free.  However, despite being busy, we still managed to see everything we had wanted to – it is definitely worth a visit.",Museum who make teenager wanted to go
"February 28, 2018",My Goddaughter was visiting & I took her there. She agreed but  at first she was not very keen.She loved it & it was a pleasurable experience. It is a beautiful museum a must see.,Awesome!
"April 11, 2019","If I visited this museum when I was 7 I got crazy probably! Magical experience with dinosaurus, darwin’s aerea and fossils! ",Natural history museum 
"June 13, 2019",Beautiful and inspiring building. Lots of nature's wonders to see and study. I was amazed by the architecture. Suitable for families. Helpful and kind staff willing to tell more of the exhibitions. Nice cafe and clean toilets. Visiting free of charge. I went there Sunday morning just before opening. There were a queue at the gates but it went quickly. ,"Great museum, great architecture"
"December 13, 2014","You begin to enjoy this museum since you are approaching by the street and watch the extraordinary building's facade (deserves some pictures). In the inside, there are many halls of different themes that are very interesting. The main hall with the dinosaur is amazing. The entrance is free, although there are some exhibitions that requiere a charge. Plan at least 3-4 hours for your visit. It is located in walking distance from South Kensington tube station. There is a big shop inside where you can buy lots of stuff.",Waw
"January 8, 2020","Waw waw wawVery clean, a lot spaces for taking pictures with nice spectacular architect, staffs very friendly securities a good and let you enjoy without any boundaries, restaurant and cafes r good 10/10   ",Our Broken Planet exhibition
"November 24, 2021","I visited the Our Broken Planet exhibition what was a great experience. Dinosaurs can bee seen too what seemed to be really funny to children. I really love this museum. If you are into minerals (quartz, opal, obsidian and so on) you must visit the giganteous exhibition in the second floor.",Great history
"July 28, 2019",I personally really enjoyed the museum. It is free and there are no queues. It can get really busy but there are so many things to look at and explore. I would definitely recommend to visit at least once and learn about so many historic things.,Good collection but very crowded museum
"December 31, 2018","We‘ve never been to a museum as crowded as the Natural History Museum in London. Although we were impressed by several rooms and pieces of the collections, it was not possible to enjoy our visit due to the crowds. Also, some rooms are highly interactive, which is good for kids but perhaps a bit too much for adults. At times, it felt like the museum wanted to attract nothing but children. For us it was very tiring, and we definitely prefer the natural history museums in Paris, NYC and that of Washington DC.",Gross Gross Gross Toilets
"August 10, 2019","In the set of toilets I used there where 3 loos, 2 of the locks on the toilet doors were broken,2 sanitary bins were full and over flowing. It was a really unpleasant experience. For a iconic tourist attraction will years of experience, you would hope that in peak seasons (i.e.summer holidays) that’s these facilities were managed more effectively.",rowded venue with no ventilation in the dinosaur exhibit and most other areas
"June 15, 2019","Busloads of school children pack the museum every weekday and parents/grandparents  bring them on weekends. We tried to get in on a Thursday, then Saturday morning and the venue was overcrowded and unventilated making it hot and very unpleasant to be there. We came back about 2.30pm on Saturday and were able to see the minerals/crystal display. We returned on a very cold Sunday morning and were able to view most exhibits except the cocoon.The best educational exhibit is the Creepy/Crawly insect section with its interactive display. The other sections worth viewing when not too crowded and hot are the mammals and dinosaur displays. In general it is unpleasant to be there in its unventilated rooms with huge crowds.",The greatest museum in the world and free
"November 13, 2018",If you combine this with the science museum it is basically the greatest museum on earth particularly for kids and teenagers. The dinosaurs are iconic and the blue whale even more so. A must for visitors in London ,What happened it used to be amazing!
"October 10, 2018","I feel so sad as I write this remembering the 2 times I have been in the past admittedly a long time ago. The building is still spectacular and worth going to see, but what happened to all the fabulous exhibits they used to have. They seem to have been all packed away in favour of interactive exhibits aimed at children. We were so disappointed. It was really packed but this would have been okay if all the schoolchildren in groups hadn’t been so “feral”. The teachers were all letting them run riot. This was just one party but all of them. Everyone was also really rude. I am a northerner and could not believe how people conduct themselves here! Try to avoid mornings and early afternoons if you can.",Awful experience
"August 9, 2018","Ridiculously busy, no visitor control, hot, no air-con of notice, hardly any guides, poor signing, small crowded toilets, outdated exhibitions, more interested in maximising income from tacky souvenirs and food. Not how I remember as a kid - what have they done?!",Too hot
"August 8, 2018",Family was very disappointed with the visit. The high levels of the crowds mixed with the heat in the museum did not make it enjoyable. People were looking flushed and not well. It was a great disappointment since it was filled with great exhibits and displays. ,Awful. Awful. Awful. 
"July 24, 2018","I spent a total of 45 minutes here; 15 minutes queuing for the toilet, 15 minutes walking around the museum and 15 minutes using the free WiFi (the only good thing about the place) googling 'things to do near me' to find an alternative way to spend the 2 or 3 hours I had planned to spend here. The museum looks grand from the outside but once inside it's a huge disappointment. I was greeted by a member of staff trying so hard to get every visitor to donate £5 that it made me not donate (it's free entry). The hard sell put me off! The layout is extremely confusing and the signage needs sorting out, I followed signs to the toilets and ended up walking round and round in circles. Then I came across a group doing the exact same thing. Very confusing coloured signs which offer very little in terms of helping you find your way around. The museum was crammed full of people so I could barely see a single thing. What I did see looked rubbish, fake animals covered in dust, plastic bones, poor signage, confusing cordons in the dinosaur section. I can't believe how bad this place is. Cafe extortionate and hardly any choice of healthy meals or snacks but loads of cakes to choose from. Avoid! Go next door to the Victoria and Albert instead. ",SO YOU LIKE QUEUES?
"January 2, 2015","Visited on Boxing Day, and have never experienced queues like it - even at the Empire State Building, New York. Not sure all is being done by the management to reduce queueing. A free flow may well allow a better flow of people. There were staff positioned at the tube exit in Gloucester Road forcing people to join queues, and barriers and barricades make queueing obligatory. When inside, there are more regulated queues. It was not a pleasant experience, and I would not recommend a visit.Interestingly enough just up the road, the Science Museum had lots of people in it but because there was no queuing structure, people tended to work out there own ebb and flow leading to a much pleasanter experience. Similarly at the V&A, all on the same day.",disappointing and depressing
"October 9, 2014","After a first great impression at the entrance i have noticed that many rooms are now filled with bars and cafe... with the usual lame coffee and plasticky cakes; Most installations are dated and by reading the descriptions it felt like every other animal got extinct or is seriously threatened by humans. Which is true..., but when you read that and look around at the crowds eating rubbish food and producing even more rubbish at an impressive rate... i found that a very depressing experience.Oh, and don't dare going close to the toilets.. the most disgusting thing ever.I have visited Vienna National History museum in Austria a few years back and THAT was worth it! Who likes this has no idea of how amazing this place could be.",Restaurant totally spoilt the experience for us!
"October 4, 2014","My boyfriend and I decided to visit the National History Museum before we caught the train home. I had been in the Museum before and had an AMAZING experience - I loved the collection of animals and felt that I just had to go back to this facinating place! My boyfriend had seen it from the outside before but hadn't been inside.We arrived about 11.30am and booked tickets to see the exibition 'Human History' (can't remember it's exact title). Good news they have a cloakroom or else we would be hauling heavy suitcases round the Museum. Anyway we walked in and went straight to the exibition which was 'Out of this world'. The fact that there was real human remains to see and information about them just made the exibition even better. We absolutely loved this and couldn't wait to see more of the Museum. We next went to the Mammals which, again, was AMAZING. We both loved seeing the reproductions of the whales hanging from the ceiling - how they got up there I do not know. As it was approaching lunchtime we decided to go for something to eat, then have a look at the Dinosaurs and the Volcano/earthquake information before heading back to the station.Now this is where all hell hits loose, and things go rapidly downhill from here -We decided to have quite a decent meal as we were going to just buy some sandwiches to eat on the train. I had eaten in the main restaurant before and was very impressed with the place. All was going very well here. The service was reasonably okay - man who served us though appeared slightly grumpy, but not rude. We both decided to order burger and chips which we both thought was delicious. We had finished our meal and decided we had some time to kill before we went back in the Museum, so we chose to sit in the Restaurant and chat. We were enjoying our conversation and both felt very relaxed. I thought I saw something running under my feet but couldn't imagine it was anything other than a bit of paper wafting in the wind. A couple of minutes past and I saw a MOUSE RUNNING UNDER MY FEET, which I let off this massive scream - I apologise to the people who were sat in the restaurant on the 28th September lunchtime...I do have a phobia of rodents unfortunately. Clearly the restaurant staff heard me and they came running over and said ''Madam, we can move you to another table'' - I am sorry but this is a completely unacceptable response! They clearly think that solves the problem, which it does not. They didn't say sorry or offer to get rid of the mouse, just they would move us to another table. We were absolutely shocked and discusted at what we saw, and left.At this point, we both decided that enough was enough and we were going to leave the Museum completely. We were enjoying ourselves greatly and were forced to leave, and decided to go into the Victoria and Albert Museum instead. We weren't really interested in the stuff in there, so feel very angry that the incident happened. It totally spoilt our afternoon!!Clearly the restaurant have big issues on either pest control, hygiene or cleanless, or they are just down right lazy and cannot be bothered to fix the hole in the wall that's letting the mouse in.",It's been a long time 
"September 30, 2021","Lovely visit, borrowed a wheelchair free of charge.  Very interesting and good facilities.  The Cocoon should be visited ",Graham is fantastic
"September 30, 2021",Graham from security delivered such phenomenal customer service to me and my friends. An extremely friendly guy!,If you like this sort of thing
"September 26, 2021","A few people said to go here so we did, no queues we went straight in, first thing I noticed was the staff were quite pushy for everyone to leave a £5 or £10 donation on entry, this was at entry point and I thought well let me see what its all about first and how good it is and then I will decide.Sorry to say it was pretty boring for me, I did not see anything that really took my interest, volcanos and earthquakes along with loads of rocks and dust movements.Apparently they get over 5 million visitors a year which is great for them, possibly because its free admission though, but its not for me.",Great visit - well worth it.
"September 25, 2021","Really a lovely visit.  My hubby and I had not been in a few decades since visiting before on a school trip.  It was amazing to see how much it had changed and improved from our visits. The various sections you can visit are all packed with lots of great and interesting facts and details and very educational. A well worth visit even if just to go down memory lane and refresh your memories, and of course knowledge!",Very educational and informative
"September 23, 2021",This museum is very informative and educational especially for the younger generation. I would recommend it for children,A must to go If your going london
"September 23, 2021","A fantastic place, if you go London this is a must especially If you love gemstones! Great day out for all the family with lots to see",Always a great day out.
"September 23, 2021",Visited to particularly see the Amazing Beasts exhibition as my kids are big Harry Potter fans.   Really well presented and held their interest for ages.  The museum itself is always great and recommend just to get ahead of the queues and access to the Anning Rooms.,Amazing Museum and Leant a not
"September 23, 2021",Had a really fun day out here and learnt a lot with the displays on offer. Will have to visit again as there is so much to take in. ,Amazing!
"September 23, 2021",I'm a museum nerd :)I must have been to all of the London museums already and I loved them all but the Blue Whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling it's mighty impressive!,Museum great but magic memories not so
"September 23, 2021","The museum was great, our son loves watching Andy on CBeebies so this was a really exciting trip, we had our photo taken by magic memories, in fairness the photos were good so we chose to buy one which wasn’t cheap £10.. and also paid extra to view the photos online which they said would be emailed to us within 24 hours. Today I received a link to access the photos which is wanting me to pay an extra £7 to “view” each photo online, that’s a slight con since we’ve already paid for this when we purchased our printed photo.. £49 to view 7 photos online is daylight robbery. Ive emailed magic memories and await their response but please be warned.",Dinosnores for Grown Ups
"January 24, 2015","A Night at the Museum! If you ever get the opportunity then go; it is a night to never forget. With Naughty Science Talks, Dino-Dinner Quiz, drinks and bug tasting, live stand-up comedy (Helen Arney singing The Elements Song) and this all ends with the coolest sleepover ever taking place beneath the fossilized skeleton of the Diplodocus that graces Hintze Hall of the Museum. Drifting off to sleep with a harpist playing music including the theme tune to Jurassic Park and waking up to the sun coming through the panels of the stained glass windows.A mention has to go to the staff - Sally and her team including security were the best ever, from the moment we first walked in they made it extra special.",Love this place
"December 5, 2014",Lot's do and lot's to see and the price is totally free!! Beat that in London! ! A must see is the Dinosaur exhibition it is truly amazing you could easily spend a whole day on just this! ,Ok
"October 31, 2014",Visited the museum during October half term...never again it was far to busy I would recommend for you to pre book your dinosaur tickets  online before you attend saves you over 1 hour of queuing time you just go to the front of the queue if you are interested in museum it's a good day and plenty to see..,Chaotic 
"October 30, 2014",Half term I know but 30 mins to get in and then over a hour to get in the dinosaur section. People sitting down wherever they could and inability to get round the exhibits caused us to quit within 15 mins. Also £2 for a standard can of coke is offensive. Badly needs some better organisation when busy and financial reality on the food front ,Dusty and old
"September 30, 2014",Huge queues which was expected but when we got inside were very disappointed.Free entry unless you wanted to see the new feature of a mammoth was a joke.The mammals were very dusty and old looking.Only enjoyable part was the dinosaurs,No Dinosaurs :(
"September 16, 2014",Specifically went to London to show our son the dinosaurs and was horrified to find out that they were closed.Would not have gone to London had we known. Having said that it is free and still an amazing museum to visit. Very clean and lots of exhibits to keep everyone entertained.Just hope the dinosaurs come back soon!,Looks tired.  London can do better than this
"August 20, 2014","I was really underwhelmed by our visit to the Nat His museum. We went on a Saturday in August so hesitate was mega busy.  The crowds just weren't managed well and the whole place was hot and airless.  We'd pre booked tickets for the Dinosaurs but still we're corralled along the walk way to see a stagnant model of a T-Rex. The thing that disappointed me most was that apart from the Red zone (earthquakes and volcanoes) the exhibits were tired and lots of the interactive stuff (especially in the creepy crawlies section) was broken.  It just needs updating and better infrastructure management.  Toilets were also poor and not clean.Having been to the Smithsonian museum of Nat History in Washington DC, London was a very poor relation.",Second best Natural History Museum in the World
"July 28, 2014",As said in the title... One of the best attractions in London and probably the second best in the world after the one in New York. It is probably the best way to spend a rainy day in London. Strongly suggested if you have children even if they don't speak the language. Been there 4-5 times and probably I will go again on my next visit to London. Extremely recommended for families on rainy days.,Amazing educational day out
"July 23, 2014","Our 14 year old daughter was in awe the minute she walked through the doors . The building alone is so imposing and impressive if it was just the empty rooms it would be a sight to see . This was mine and partners second visit together but this time our daughter came too . It really is a magnificent museum to visit . However the "" improvements"" that had been made detract away from the original displays from the early days . We felt as though we were being directed into shops and cafes when all we wanted to see were exhibits . We understand that an income is needed for the upkeep but to us an entrance fee would be better to see more exhibits than people eating and leaving rubbish on tables and floors . All the hands on exhibits to us take up far too much time and therefore you don't get to see everything . We had a very enjoyable day and would definitely visit again .",Outdated and questionable displays
"June 17, 2014","My last visit to this museum dates 13 years back. I was impressed and told myself that I must return some day... me not being a museum person at all.So today my first impression was that things have changed for the worst. I cut my visit short as I got bored after checking out three of the four zones. Starting with the Blue Zone, I first went to the dinosaurs which is the coolest part of the museum. I counted four animated dinosaurs including the T-Rex which were all a bit lame. The T-Rex seems to be the major attraction here as people pose for pictures, so be prepared to be shoved around. If you are interested in the history of palaeontology, there are plenty of displays to inform you about when the first fossils were discovered, how they are named etc. The Mammals section shows some stuffed animals from the museum's historical collection which by now have faded and worn out. I also checked out the blue whale but couldn't figure what the fuss is about. If you have ever seen a whale in nature, you'll be disappointed how unreal this model looks like.Off to the Green Zone where I only visited the Creepy Crawlies. Nothing worth mentioning, only lots of information on display and a gigantic scorpion model. What a disappointment.You reach the Orange Zone via the lift which takes you to the 7th floor of the cocoon shaped building. Again lots information to read if you're into it, interactive displays and videos running in the background which I found disturbing. I was expecting a huge collection of insects but only few on display of which of them in such bad light that you couldn't make them out properly.In one of these zones I spotted a tank with a crab pierced on a stick (it looked real and dead, of course). Visitors are encouraged to pull it out of the water to see if it weighs more in or out of the water. What a disturbing display, if it was indeed a dead crab.There is an overall children-friendly theme in the museum and I dare to say it's mostly aimed at them. Kids brochures about the museum can be purchased for £5 at the entrance. There are lots of benches in case your feet feel tired and you need to have a little rest. I found the architecture of the building is much more intriguing than the exhibitions. Be prepared to have your bags checked.",Great place shame about the over inflated prices of food
"June 2, 2014","I cannot fault what is on offer to see here, by the end of a full day I was on information overload but enjoyed every minute of it.I was disappointed though by the over inflated prices of food, yes I know entry is free and it is London but to pay £2 for a can of diet coke and £5 for what is two pieces of bread with tuna and cucumber in-between is daylight robbery - for 2 of us it was £14 !!!For me it just spoilt what was a great visit and yes I did leave a donation.Well worth a visit but take some of your own food, snacks etc ",too crowded to see the exhibits properly!
"April 14, 2013",30 minute queue to get in - 30 minute queue for dinosaur exhibit - so many people it made the emperor penguin arctic huddle look appealing! you couldnt see the exhibits properly and it was so hot! many of the exhibits were disappointing (eg creepy crawlies) as they seemed to focus purely on children's  hands on activities at the expense of interesting and revealing facts or artefacts! even the shops were disappointing with mundane gifts and toys! very disappointing!,Very Boring
"August 28, 2012","When we last went to The Natural History Museum, I thought that it was absolutely boring, and i mean, a museum should be fun and nice to be around.We will not be back again!!!!!",Sadly showing its age
"August 26, 2012","Like many UK citizens I have fond memories of visiting this museum as part of a school trip.  I am sad to say that a once great institution has lost its way in the 21st century as both me and my wife were badly dissapointed by our visit this week.The problem can be summed up in one word - overcrowding.The problem is that the museum has always had sections that are more popular than others but this never stopped you enjoyng them at least not until this visit.  Problem 1 - the entry queue, has no other purpose than to slow down entry and restrict the number of people entering the museum at any one time.  A 45 minute queue to get in with no cover is not pleasent.Problem 2 - the queue for the dinosaur fossils.  This begins in the main entry hall and snakes around under the brontosaurus fossil that any previous visitor will know well until you get into the dino area.  After this you are on a forced track around the section akin to a queue for a US theme park ride culminating in a large animatronic T-rex model before you can get out of this horrendous section.Problem 3 - at the end of each of the museum sections, you find yourself thrust into highly commercial shopping or eating areas.  Again think theme park here and you wont go too far wrong.  Now I personally quite like shops and can resist the temptations but I pity the poor parents who get trapped into having to buy their kids the latest dino model.  In short the museum has become horrilbly commercialized.  Of course some people may enjoy hearing the dipplodocus fossil ""roar"" for the pricely sum of £10 but sadly for me it just trivialises what a museum is about.Problem 4 - families with young kids.  Museums for me are about learning, but swarms of sub 5 year olds are going to learn next to nothng from the exibits here, this is definately a museum for older children not the little ones.There are some plus points of course as well - for example the architecture of the buiding itself is fantastic and actually better than most of the exibits but really the museum needs a complete rethink in my view, spreading out the popular sections throughout the museum to reduce overcrowding would be a good idea.  A ticketed approach to reduce overcrowding.  Even an entrance fee to reduce over-commercializing the exibits.In short the place is more like a theme park than a place of learning and sadly I'd rather take my kids to Disney as its far better done!",Most over rated museum in UK - Avoid
"November 15, 2010","I had high hopes for this place. I thought the English were famous for their museums, and on the whole I saw some amazing things whilst touring the UK. However this has to be the worst Museum I have ever been to. Ok. To be balanced, here are the positives - - Free Entry- Perfect Location- Beautiful architecture- Some nice bones and speciminsThats about it though. I felt like I was back at High School. I have never been anywhere with such a high density of Children - not even Disney land. They should totally control the numbers they allow into this place on a day. it ruined the whole experience for me. Everywhere you turned there were groups of teenagers running around, screaming, shouting, TOUCHING the exhibits without any respect for the age of the things they were looking at. There were no security staff in sight, those that we did eventually spot looked as young as the school children, with their very informal T-Shirts & Fleeces. We only realised they were staff when we saw their 2-way radios sticking out from their faded black denim and exposed underwear.Perhaps due to the high volume of school children, the exhibitis have a sense of being ""dumbed down""  for this age range. Although impressive, the anamatronic dinosaurs seemed rather immature. Again, perhaps of the high volume of school children, many of the exhibits were broken, out of order or looking very tired and worn. The cafe was prices were absolutely shocking - even for London, and it took about 30 minutes of queuing to be served by a grumpy man who hardly spoke any English. If you're travelling with a very young family you may enjoy this. I however have been to far better examples of natural history museums. This was more like a zoo, with the animals being living school children monkeys.",The Most Amazing Museum Ever!
"July 11, 2008","Ok, so where do I start. I believe that the best place to start is with the incredible point of the museum being completely free. Of course, donations are needed to keep the museum running, so just dropping in some spare change will be great for the museum. Considering everything else in London is overly expensive this is impressive before you even step foot into the building!The building itself is most impressive. It is a huge, old building, which is fascinating to take pictures by. The first thing you see as you enter is a huge dinosaur skeleton, which is again impressive to take photographs by. There are different zones which give you a feel on what is in each one, therefore you can decide which zone you would like to venture into if you don't have much time. This is what happened to me and I chose the green  and blue zones which is filled with animals, insects, birds, dinosaurs, human biology etc. The animal collection is AMAZING! They basically have almost every species of animal and bird. I also took many photos by these. They look almost realistic on camera! There is this one huge room filled with the biggest animals on earth, there are elephants, giraffes, hippo,s rhinos and a big blue whale the size of the whole room!!!!There is also a red zone, which is mostly to do with natural forces and the earth itself. The last zone is the orange zone which is the Darwin Centre and the Wildlife Garden. There is also a new buttefly house, but you have to pay extra for this. There are also many cafes and restaurants inside, I went to one of them and they had lovely cakes for a wuick snack after a long time of walking around. I would definitely recommend this for families and a fabulous day out!",Overcrowded and boring
"August 14, 2022","Do you love hot, sweaty, overcrowded rooms full of screaming children? Then the natural history museum is the place for you! With exhibitions that provide almost no interesting information, you’re guaranteed to have a once-in-a-lifetime experience… because you’ll never want to experience this again.",Massively overcrowded
"April 12, 2022",I feel very sorry to write a review like this. I have been here many times and was very excited to bring my daughter for the first time. We came down from Scotland especially. It was an horrendous experience. You could barely move for the crowds and she was so overwhelmed by the noise and chaos we had to leave. Whoever is responsible for control of numbers urgently needs to review this situation. I would rather pay and actually be able to see something . The current situation is untenable.,Childhood memories destroyed
"April 4, 2022","I used to visit this lovely building and Victorian displays, as a child, in the 1950's.I went back last weekend and was appalled. Difficult to get in and needed e-ticket.Once inside my childhood memories were destroyed. They have vandalized a lovely piece of architecture and it is now full of shops, cafes and modern displays. No doubt this is ""progress"" but I will never go back there.",Great for kids
"January 12, 2021","Lots of kid's favorites,lots of interactive exhibits. The building it's in is gorgeous, especially that main hall. Fun part of town too.",Massive and endless fun
"July 31, 2020",This was amazing and was full of endless fun for a whole family. I visited on a rainy day and was amazed with the amount of things you can see. The exhibits are cool and don’t get boring.,Interesting visit 
"April 2, 2020","Loved the layout and set up if the museum. Loved the dinosaur exhibit, and whale 🐳 and large animals. Definitely worth a photo at the top of the stairs. ",Big and informative collection
"March 23, 2020","I would recommend to show this place to your kids - informative, interesting, and rich collection about geology, dinosaurs, humans, and much more. Of course, adults will like this place too, I promise.",A true gem
"March 20, 2020",Exactly as you’d expect – truly amazing but horrendously busy; to the point where it was difficult to move around without simply being carried along in a constant surge of people.,brilliant
"March 16, 2020",Reall love coming here while in London. Always things to see. Just love the building-it is even more interesting than the exhibits!!,Fantastic visit for all ages and is free
"March 15, 2020","We truly enjoy this museum and love that is free and right next to another museum, which is why I recommend going there as early as possible to jump to the next (across the street) Museum.I enjoy initiating at the Core going from the center of the earth, enjoying the earthquake and ending at the beautiful salon where the Whale is suspended in the most amazing ceiling ",Wonderful
"March 6, 2020","Wonderful and very big museum. The dinosaur exhibition was do crowded we couldn’t see anything, but there’s  A LOT of other things to see. Fantastic that there’s no fre",Excellent experience!
"March 6, 2020",Starting with a beautiful building passing by the skeletons and all the exhibitions is undoubtedly exceptional.Excellent to spend a morning or an afternoon with the children and have an enriching cultural experience.Highly recommended.,Great
"March 6, 2020",This museum is absolutely fantastic. The exhibitions are very interesting and there is even a real size dinosaur replica.,Darwin would feel right at home
"March 5, 2020","Excellent atmosphere, terrific period building, first class write-ups and displays.  The culmination of 19th century science brought up to-date.  Worth the trek to get there.",Excellent museum
"October 28, 2019","It’s a huge museum where you can stay the whole day or come at least twice. There was a long queue at the front side so didn’t want to wait and walked away towards the science museum. There was another entrance with a shorter and faster queue so we entered in 5 min. There are many places to eat something but you can also eat your own food there. There is water to fill up your bottles. The museum is free but donations are welcome. The museum plan is 1 pound.The toilets were very busy. When we left the museum around 1 pm, there was still a long queue. At the moment there is an ice skating place in front of the museum. 9 pounds per person. It’s a great museum for all ages including adults. ",This place is AMAZING!
"October 27, 2019","It's free! But make a nice donation.Gorgeous architecture coupled with amazing exhibits. If you live in London, you should be a member and come every week.We bought memberships just for this one trip so we could see the Wildlife Photography exhibit that was sold out. Lots of cool perks including a quiet lounge with views of the city and the outside architecture.",Cool place
"October 27, 2019","We were standing in a kilometer long queue (took more than an hour) before we were let in, it was the week of school holiday. However, it was worth it!",Silent disco 
"October 26, 2019","Love how the museum puts on events like the silent disco. A great use of the space. Last night was the second one I've been to here and it was again, incredible. Great music and the building looked fab. Who wouldn't want to dance under the whale? Thank you for being brave with the space and doing things most museums would shy away from. ",Legendary
"October 24, 2019",This museum is the most famous for the natural museum. Walking into Hintze hall underneath the largest animal on earth was a memorable experience. ,Free Museum
"October 21, 2019",Excellent & Impressive - the entry hall will get your attention already!!!  Then there's the dinosaurs exhibit!!,FREE!
"October 20, 2019","This museum is free to the public. Has a wide variety from Dinosaurs and Mammals, to Birds and creepy crawlers. Rocks, minerals and human evolution. Great way to spend the day. ",Always worth a visit
"October 19, 2019",There will almost always be lots of children milling about when you visit this museum. It can get frustrating at times but it's important to remember how lucky we are that a place like this exists with so much knowledge available for us to learn from. Exhibits are engaging and accessible to all,Enjoyable visit
"October 17, 2019",We enjoyed visiting the museum. We arrived soon after it opened and by noon when we met again in the main hall it was very busy with school groups (lovely to see those little ones so interested!) and harder to get photos of exhibits.Very well laid out and an enjoyable wander around. Quite a few interactive exhibits.,Worth it for the architecture alone
"October 16, 2019","The best of many natural history museums I've been too. The gem and dinosaur areas went above and beyond the normal taxidermy animal you come to expect. But even if you're not as interested in the exhibits, the structure itself, inside and out, cannot be missed. ",Great Place
"October 9, 2019","The museum has wealth of info and is an amazing place. Ideally one would need days to go through every exhibit, but even if you have an hour it is worth a visit to the main exhibits! ",A must go for kids in London 
"October 8, 2019","National history museum -  a must go if you are going to London with your kids , lot of learning and experience and it's free.The first thing I noticed was the building such an architecture it's sufficient in itself to see.the huge dinosaur in the entrance is welcoming as that's a demo wat the museum has in store for us. I had less time so I couldn't see the whole museum but I did see the gems section and planets section found it very informative . There are guided tours which can be taken and I am sure they are worth it. However  one thing I liked was there were groups of small kids with teachers and museum people explaining them everything. That was very impressive.it requires atleast 3-4 hours to see the whole thing at your own pace and reading everything . There were   also lots of free activities throughout the day some practical, some demonstrations, all very interesting. I think everyone should themselves visit and take their kids also.attaching the screenshots of the map to help you plan your visit. ",Highly recommend a visit with children
"October 7, 2019","On a recent trip to London we visited this museum. You could easily spend a few hours here. Be prepared as it does get busy! Very informative and educational for kids and they learnt a lot. Did feel the signage wasn't great - took us a while to figure out how to get to the dinosaurs! Museum is free and worth doing but allow some time. There is a shop selling books, stones etc and also a small coffee shop on site. The science museum is next door but we didnt have time to do it but factor in some time if wanting to do both",Wow
"October 3, 2019","The billing itself are a great monument of an outstanding architecturere,we entered to see the dinosaur exposition, it is amazing, the moon exposition also remarkable, I recommend to visit this museum , you won't regret",Stunning building
"October 2, 2019","All attractions in the museum are very interesting but none compare to the building itself. Details of monkeys, birds, leaves in the portic arches reveal how are the people who erected it. Take time not only to see the skeletons but also to appreciate every detail at your sight.",Amazing museum in a stunning building
"October 1, 2019",Absolutely fabulous museum with amazing displays and interactive exhibits you could probably spend the day here as it is vast and there a various eating options available.Don't miss the Museum of the Moon exhibition which is currently on Until January 2020.And the whole lot is contained in a beautiful building.Very highly recommended.,Great for all the family
"September 30, 2019","I took my Mom, Husband and 2 Nephews who were 7 and 14 years old. Everyone loved it! It is such a great attraction and you could easily spend all day there. Luckily we got there just before it opened and started to queue (about 20 minutes before opening time) - i would definitely recommend doing this as when we came out at lunch time the queue was snaking twice round the building. It is a free attraction and there are lots of different exhibits to see. The building itself is beautiful and the grounds are also lovely - we took a packed lunch with us and sat outside to eat our lunch before heading off elsewhere in London. ",Free attraction you don't want to miss while in London
"September 30, 2019","The museum is huge, so you better prepare yourself for a good 3 hours to experience everything from the very beginning of humans on earth to our days. You can even experience an earthquake without the danger in real life.   ",Great organisation 
"September 29, 2019",Fantastic place. Free and super clean. Good place for everyone. Good organisation with maps and lift ,Magnificent museum
"September 27, 2019","Totally recommend to animal lovers, but even if not, the moon exhibit itself is worth the visit. Their invertebrate section was a bit small but arranged well. The dinosaurs were extremely well placed and the ""live"" T-Rex is a must.I recommend that you free up at least 3-4 hours ind order to get the full experience (unfortunately I only had a couple of hours and missed some of the exhibits).",Big Crowds
"August 27, 2019",This is a great museum but it was hot and very crowded when we were there. It was a Saturday and school is out on holiday so surely that is why. Many amazing things to see and experience. Try to go early to avoid the crowds. ,Timelessly beautiful
"August 26, 2019","The Natural History Museum is a must-visit for people who love browsing museums, and also have a keen interest in wildlife and biodiversity. Here, you will find specimens of animals that have gone extinct or are now critically endangered.While the dinosaurs exhibit and the moon exhibit tend to be crowded, you usually get to enjoy quieter aisles in the higher floors.You can also explore how the museum is involved in research work to help protect existing wildlife.Great place for both the young and the old.",We Stayed Ages!
"August 26, 2019","So much to see and do here. We walked and walked and walked, and could have stayed longer! Loved the Dinosaur exhibition, including the animatronic T Rex! . The roof in the stunning Hinze Hall is hand painted with plants from all over the world and is quite spectacular. Definitely a great place to spend time in London and externally the building is so beautiful. ",amazing museum for kids
"August 22, 2019","We visited this museum with three kids 10 and under. They really enjoyed the visit. There was too much to see and do, to see it all in one day. We will definitely return. The museum guides are great souvenirs and well worth the money.",Best museum ever
"August 18, 2019",Spectacular is the word for this.  So many interesting sites and exhibitions. We enjoyed it. From fossils to skeletons and earthquakes. From rocks to bones. ,recommended
"August 17, 2019","I recommend visiting this museum, especially if you have children / teenagers, both for the architecture of the building and for the enormous amount of animals of every size, type and age. Everything is well exposed and explained, the rooms are spacious, the collection of diamonds on display is very beautiful, the tour in the sector where the formation of the earth is explained, the platform that simulates earthquakes is very exciting. All this and much more ... and it's also free.",One of my favourite places in London! 
"August 16, 2019","Wonderful museum, so much to see! Massive fan of David Attenborough so after watching one of his docs this was first on my list for London! You do need quite a bit of time here so get up early! ",OVER-RATED
"August 14, 2019","Huge queues too get in, taking far too long.  Far too busy and noisy, with families and children running around, yelling, blocking routes and photos, barging people out of the way, and generally being disruptive.  Many areas could not really cope with the numbers allowed in.  The museum uses too many information boards to try to tell stories, rather than actual exhibits.  It is over-hyped, and visiting is generally an extremely unpleasant and un-museum-like experience.  It's all too focussed on sensationalism and dinosaurs.",Fabulous!
"August 14, 2019",If you have any interest in either natural history or beautiful architecture then this is a must see. Fabulous building and amazing exhibits. Highly recommend!,Science and Architecture
"August 12, 2019","Great to visit, just mind the literal seas of people. Many of exhibits are inclined a good bit more for children than adults so do keep that in mind. I would like to have an optional guided tour  just for the architecture though. The latter is worth going for alone. ",It’s crowded in August
"August 12, 2019","This place is just amazing, and the saying ‘something for everyone’ has never been more true. We also visited in December 2017 and it was much quieter. In August the ques are long, and the noise and crowd inside can be a bit overwhelming. I would recommend getting there 15min before open, then you’ll have a chance to explore in relative piece. The moon room is very cool.",Naturally Great Place to Visit in London 
"August 11, 2019","Another of the spectacular free museums in London. Within minutes of arriving we knew we'd only be able to scratch the surface in the time we'd allowed for the visit. We concentrated on fossils, minerals and gems. We could have spent the whole three hours we had in just the marine fossil exhibits. This is certainly high on the list of things to do again next time we're in London. Easy access via either bus or Underground South Kensington Station. Excellent accommodations for handicapped visitors. ",Behind the Scenes Spirit Collection Tour
"August 11, 2019","This is a review of the Behind the Scenes Tour: Spirit Collection. This was one of the highlights of my three-week trip to Europe. You get to go into the basement vaults and see thousands of specimens in alcohol (that’s the “spirits” part) that the museum has collected for a couple hundred years. I won’t give away too much, but if you’re a fan of Charles Darwin then you won’t want to miss this. Our guide, Tom, works at the museum and was incredibly knowledgeable about both current research and the history of the collection. This really is a behind the scenes tour. You see specimens so big, so old, and so rare that they can’t be shown in the museum. You’re in the storerooms and labs that are usually only accessible by the scientists at the museum. If you love science and history, take this tour! ",Wow!
"August 9, 2019","I kept wishing I had my kids or my grandkids with me but to be honest I enjoyed this like a kid so I didn't need them, but they all would have loved it!  There were fossils and dinosaurs and sea shells and rocks and a huge model of the moon!  There were fish and land animals and bugs and snakes!  There was literally something for everyone.  You could spend hours in here and we did, but still didn't see more than 1/2 of what they have to offer.  So worth a visit, especially if you do have your kids or grandkids with you.  One tip....don't limit yourself to looking around.  Look up too!  There is so much to see.",Short visit to natural museum
"August 9, 2019",Visited London Natural History museum with my wife in beginning of August. This is very nice place to visit shortly or longer time. Shortly just to see some selected parts like we did. But can also take long time especially with children. Museum is also very well explaining facts for natural life and is thus a very educating place. Especially for school groups. Free entrance makes this very popular place to visit.,Fun!
"August 8, 2019","Fun for the entire family. Also, great place to learn wee bit about a lot of things that make this world what it is.",Awesome museum
"August 7, 2019",First museum we visited in London an it was such a great experience. The queue was long but passed quickly and the exhibits inside were amazing to see ,pay a visit!
"August 7, 2019","very good museum, went with my kids and they were fascinated by so many things to see and learnworth going",Awesome!
"August 3, 2019","This place will just wow you the moment you step in. The artifacts are just amazing and breathtaking. Even the building itself is such a beauty. The color of the tiles were arranged in a way that's symmetrical and mesmerizing. If only there were less crowd, it would have been more comfortable to take our time and browse. ",It's all there
"August 1, 2019",If you are looking for natural history this is a place to go.  It can easily take you a whole day (or two) to get through the many exhibits.  Almost something for everyone to see.,What a beautiful building!!
"July 29, 2019","Came here as soon as we arrived from the airport. Since our hotel room wasn’t ready yet. This place is only a block away from our hotel. Exhibits were great but if you’ve been to Smithsonian,MET, Field Museum, then this is nothing different to my opinion. You can skip this. We were for like an hour just to kill time. We didn’t stay longer because it was hot inside. Not sure of the ventilation of the building but it was really uncomfortable inside. Plus there were too many tour groups. The building is beautiful outside though. Impressive!",Amazing architecture 
"July 29, 2019","You could visit this museum for the building alone. It’s such a beautiful building. And the museum is free, as are all the museums in London. It has exhibits over many levels and the most popular by far with all the kids was the dinosaur exhibit. At the time of our visit there was an exhibit of the moon but I think this was temporary. There is bag storage available for a fee and you can take photos.",Magnificent 
"July 29, 2019","One of the world’s great museum, in a magnificent building. A remarkable collection but not overwhelming. Invest 3 hours and you’ll see most of it. Don’t miss the earthquake room! Only criticism is it’s a bit too focused on kids and they over do the cartoonish style a bit too much. Grew tiresome. Free admission, so don’t visit London without investing some time here. ",Wow wow wow
"July 29, 2019",The building alone is breathtaking! Then allthe exhibits inside makes this for a wonderful time. I would recommend more than one day as we spent 7 hours there and had to miss quite a bit because of not enough time. The moon exhibition was out of this world! ,Best in the world
"July 29, 2019",Best Natural History Museum in the world. Huge collection of everything and so something to wonder for everyone (from 5 to 100 years old). Great collection of dinosaurs and minerals. Takes hours to see everything. ,Just incredible
"July 28, 2019",The whale bones in the foyer is unbelievable. The whole place is just amazing. Makes me wish I lived in London full time. ,Just amazing
"July 27, 2019","Well, this is an amazing way to spend couple hours (you will need 3-4 hours, even you could spend a day easily); especially if you have some kids.You have lots of coolections to visit: dinosaurs, mammals, fish and marine life, minerals, human evolution. Lots of interactive games for kids, to learn hi the body and mind is functioning, different insects, how animals are walking, and so one.Then the building is just amazing. One of the nicest buildings I ever saw.So, very nice museum, and it is free. ","Amazing, wish we had more time"
"July 22, 2019","We took two kids (8 and 10 years) and our 8 year old was determined he would be bored.  From the moment we got inside both kids were so excited to be there and couldn't wait to see what was in the next section.  The displays are really well displayed and captivating, the information is really clear and the interactive sections well thought out. From the dinosaurs to mammals to corals and birds it was so well done that we could have spent hours in each section.  Ultimately had to almost drag the children out.Will definitely allow more time when we next make it to London.",Not only for kids
"July 22, 2019",This  is the place for everyone. Don't get discouraged by the crowds waiting in the queue - it moves pretty fast. I've heard that the best time to visit is just any time but summer holidays ;),Too crowded
"July 16, 2019","Same as at some other museums in London, it was too crowded and too hot inside, especially at some parts of the museum.I understand it's free so many people visit, but under these circumstances nobody can really enjoy a visit. I think that limiting the number of people that can be inside at the same time could help.",Busy
"September 13, 2020",Surprisingly or perhaps not as free tickets but quite busy. Didnt have the time to stay long but would be good if have a free day. Quite busy especially the dinos,Must go with kids
"September 7, 2020","A must go place... and if your kids have interest in dinosaurs then it is top of it... Go on upper floor as well there is butterfly shows and different things hut it has ticket . Otherwise , its free. You can easily spend 3-4 hrs and then you can go for food  to al beruit express for labenese which is walking distance from there and snowflake icecream . Good day out.",Hm not enough seats
"September 7, 2020",Thanks to covid-19  not enough  seats to sit and stare at the dinosaur also food is not cheap for families ,Really good!
"September 5, 2020","With the social distancing had to book in advance to get a slot. Quite alot of exhibits closed or open but not fully,but to be expected. Social distancing was good generally. Such a great place to visit. The building is stunning from the outside and so interesting inside. The T-Rex is iconic to see when visiting! Some cafes and gift shops open. Really enjoyed",History lessons
"September 4, 2020","Booked a slot to the museum, on time and lovely welcome.Exhibits amazing, well laid out, just enough time to the dinosaurs exhibits and a few hours in the red zone.Will be back with our grandchildren soon",Natural History Museum is a Natural London Wonder
"September 4, 2020",Maybe it's the Covid period but there were a lot of things closed.  This place is magnificent!  It's gorgeous.  The exhibits I did see where well laid out and informational.  This should be something to see if you're in London on a holiday.,Love this museum and the dinosaurs
"August 31, 2020","This museum is fantastic, from the awesome dinosaur exhibition, the somewhat old and a bit tatty mammals which are older than my grandparents but still retain their charm and all of the wonderful exhibits.",Loved it! 
"August 31, 2020",It's a must to visit this museum! We had a wonderful time here. You learn a lot and there are many attractions. It's better to plan at least half-day to visit it entirely. ,Less crowded during Covid
"August 30, 2020","Ok so perhaps the museum isn’t quite as great during Covid. Some attractions are closed and not all the interactive exhibits are available. However, when you weigh this up with no crowds, timed entry, no queues etc I prefer this way of viewing the museum! Last time I came I had to leave it was so busy, so prefer it with restricted numbers. We visited on a Saturday at 2pm and felt like we were the only ones there at times! Felt really safe too. Kids loved it, which is the main thing. Can’t wait to return!",Stunning Museum
"August 27, 2020","The family and I visited as one of our many points of interest during our 4 night visit to the capital. Set in the rather boho area of South Kensington, the museum is literally a 5 minute walk from the tube station (Circle, District and Piccadilly lines).An incredible piece of architecture containing some magnificent sights and artifacts, this a place that will keep both young and old engaged and fascinated. Be prepared to use shanks pony though as this place is absolutely huge with so much to see, my feet were in bits at the end of the day. Plenty of local amenities in the surrounding area, parks coffee houses, shops, restaurants and places to rest the legs.Definitely worth a visit.",Family trip to London
"February 10, 2019",Extremly recommended for all age groups. I have to admit I'm not a museum person but this museum is very interesting and lots of hands on experience. ,Con trick
"February 3, 2019","Wanted to see the Wildlife Photographer of the year exhibition, but was not allowed to enter without paying for membership as well as the admission. Despicable!",Spend a day at the museum! 
"January 31, 2019","The museum is beautiful! Love their attractions too! If you visit on Nov-Dec, they have a skating rink just outside the museum. Make sure to buy your tickets ahead to reserve a slot. ",Mind blowing 
"January 21, 2019","It would take a month to review this place properly - suffice to say, if you’re in the area, don’t miss it and free up a couple of hours.  Should be mandatory for all kids, a place of wonder.",So much to see and learn from
"January 19, 2019",Loved the national history museum and was amazed by the amount of things to see and learn from. You would need a full day to truly see everything and we found navigating even with a map a little confusing. Enjoyed the shop there and all the things it offers. ,Great visit with a 4 year old and baby in tow
"January 15, 2019","We live in London but this was our first visit to the museum with our kids (just turned 4 year old and a 6 month old baby). I was very pleasantly surprised by just how accessible it is with a buggy. The hassle is actually getting to the museum - South Ken tube is not at all accessible, a lot of steps to get up to station entrance level and then again to get to road level. On the way home we decided to just walk on foot to Victoria train station (from where we could get an overland train) and it took about half an hour and was better than lugging the buggy up and down a variety of staircases. We went on a Thursday in term time. It was busy in places - the volcano section in particular was chockablock with school trip kids - but generally we got to see everything without issue. Once there, the cloakroom is helpful and you can check buggies in for free so long as they are folded. You can also wheel them round the museum if you don’t want to check them in, everywhere we went was very buggy accessible. There are plenty of cafes and pit stops for food and drink. We had pit stop one in the cafe on the ground floor in the volcano/earthquake wing, a lunch box for our 4 year old was (I think) £5.50. That was for half a cheese sandwich, fruit, drink and a muffin.  There was mould on the muffin inside and they promptly swapped it for a free one but not the best start. We later had a proper lunch in the dinosaur cafe, which does pizzas, burgers and wraps. The cafe was quite quiet, the waitress said it tends to be less busy if weather outside is good (tourists tend to do the museums if they get a wet day). Food in the cafe was good and our 4 year old loved the animatronic dinosaurs in there. We were probably at the museum 1030-1500 and got to see most of what we wanted. We skipped through volcanos quickly due to volume of school kids, tried the earthquake room, then went through the insect room, then dinosaurs and the mammals section. We also did the big hall. The whale hanging in the big hall is good but frankly, it is never going to be a proper replacement for the old diplodocus that used to hang there! Our 4 year old liked the dinosaurs best (obviously) with the robot T. rex the number one highlight. There are also about one million gift shops in there so never fear that you will go home without a souvenir...There is also an interactive room in the basement (called Investigate I think) which features on “must do” reviews of the museum, we went down to go in as it’s meant to be excellent for kids, only to find it was shut for use by school groups only. I think the sign said it was closed all morning and until mid afternoon.  I’m not sure whether we just got unlucky on our day or if this is a permanent thing. Overall, a really great day and our four year old is already asking to go back again. ",Very busy 
"January 12, 2019","Visited on the 3rd January and was not prepared for how busy it would be. Visited once before when my son was a toddler and it was so calm so think I was just not expecting it. A lovely interesting museum, especially for kids, but sadly it was just too busy for us to see things properly. Kept getting shouted at to ""keep moving as its busy"" in the dinosaur section....how can you keep moving in a museum when you are supposed to read things? This seemed a bit odd and got a bit a annoying as felt they were rushing you out. Would have stayed longer and seenmore if not so crammed. Hope to return (on a quieter day!)","🏛Rich, educating and fascinating🦕"
"January 8, 2019"," Absolutely worths a visit.The quality and quantity of the preserved artifacts are surprising.The structure is suggestive and immense; it hosts several areas, each one dedicated to a specific theme: animal and human species and the various evolutions to date, passing through an interesting interactive path dedicated to human body, brain, emotions and their respective functions and abilities.The animal exhibiting area is breathtaking: it is literally surrounded by majestic prehistoric skeletons, exhibited with care and originality. Also the numerous animals reproduced and stuffed, from the oldest to the recent ones, is very suggestive to watch.The itinerary includes some salient details on the extinct and endangered species, exposing their causes and consequences.The wide ""Geology"" area reserved for minerals is stunning, you can admire many rarities on display. It' s also possible to try the simulation of a strong earthquake occurred in Japan in 1995.The structure is very well taken care of, the entrance is free, you can make a donation to the exit, and it will be certainly deserved for this museum so rich, educational (for children and not only) and original.It worths spending a whole day there.",Theme park for young children - tacky and noisy
"January 6, 2019","For children i’m sure it’s very good. Endless shops selling tacky souvenird, like plastic dinosaurs. Endless cafes, and between them play areas for kids.oh yes, the occasional exhibit, surrounded by screens, pictures and explanations aimed at - kids. All inside a beautiful historic building. If you want a theme park, no doubt it’s fine. If you want, what is it they call it? A natural history museum, look elsewhere. Vienna has a brilliant natural history museum if you can make it. If you want a kids playground, it’s perfect.",If time allowed we would have gone back
"January 3, 2019",Fabulous museum stuffed full of treasures from around the world. We spent 3 hours and saw only a small corner. ,Great museum for all age groups
"April 16, 2019","Lots of different departments and exhibits, should be something for everybody. The earth-section with earthquake simulation was modern and well made. The dinosaur-section will also be exciting for most people. It pays off to arrive at opening hours, it did get quite crowdy on a Sunday.",Beautiful Building
"April 10, 2019",Stunning building inside-out. Visit is free so worth stepping in to see the collections if one has time to spare in London or if weather not suited for outdoor sightseeing. Weekends though seems very busy. Weekdays might be less,"Great place to spend a few hours, for free in London !!!"
"March 29, 2019","The NHM is a great place to spend a few hours looking at the history of the world. You have to pay to see some special exhibitions, but we just stuck to the free selection. We had two teens with us & at first they weren’t over excited to say the least. But when they seen the dinosaurs they soon change there moods. There’s not many places in London that are free & well worth a visit. But the NHM is definitely one to fit in if you’ve got the time.",History and Architecture
"March 20, 2019",Great day out for all the family. The building is spectacular from outside too. Plenty to see and do for the whole family..,Stunning
"March 18, 2019",The Natural History Museum is very educational yet entertaining at the same time. It would make a great weekend away trip for the kids and adults alike. The dinosaur section was particularly impressive,"Fun, free and entertaining "
"March 1, 2019",A great place to come for a few hours or even a few days. There is so much to see and do plus it’s free! Try to avoid the main entrance and head for exhibition road entrance which rarely has a queue. Then head to whatever takes your fancy. Going to the dinosaurs section is a must and also the whale skeleton in the great hall. Plenty of friendly staff around and also cafes and shops. Great for all ages.,Half term mayhem
"February 19, 2019",I now know how it feels like being herded like a sheep. The museum is amazing and you can easily spend 2-3 days but do avoid half term. We didn’t get chance to see some of the exhibits as the rest of the “flock” of people around us didn’t want to stop and just carried us forward. Our little boy loved the animatronic dinosaur. ,One of the places to visit.
"February 18, 2019","I have been in the museum in the past and I was as I remembered it: huge, impressive, located in a very nice building.  You need a lot of time to see it all! ",An amazing Museum and free
"February 11, 2019","Found we had a few hours to burn on sunday and this was a great place to visit, Amazing place and you would learn loads, Great place to bring kids and would need a few hours to get around the whole place. You would be tired after walking the whole place so said id come back another day and do the science museum but the national history museum was a great spot and very informative.",Not what it used to be.
"February 11, 2019","My last visit to this museum had been in the late 1990s, when a full day had not been enough to take in all their incredible collections. It was superb and fascinating. One of the best days out I had ever experienced, so I was looking forward to a return visit to see how the museum had evolved. I wish I hadn’t bothered.Overcrowded, tacky, tired, run down and dumbed down are words that sadly sum up this once world-beating museum.Previously, large and spacious galleries had enabled the public to walk at their leisure along row upon row of wonderful skeletons and majestic stuffed animals with glass cabinets in their hundreds, displaying collections of insects and animals in their thousands, there to inform and captivate, to amaze and bring wonder. Now, the heaving crowds are herded along plasterboard-lined narrow corridors, decked out with brightly coloured plastic signs, past endless displays of interactive computer screens with rows of illuminated buttons (many not working), a myriad of diagrams and information boards with cartoon fonts, naturally interspersed with the ubiquitous gift shops and special ‘pay to enter’ or ‘members only’ rooms. What few exhibits remain look like they have come from a 1970’s theme park, their paint peeling, their surfaces covered in thick, grey dust.Sadly, the exhibits we had come all this way to see are no more. No doubt packed away behind the scenes as it is no longer PC to display dead animals. It’s all about conservation and habit loss these days, don’t you know? It’s almost as if the museum is trying to distance itself from the ‘naughty Victorians’ for amassing their world-class collections in the first place.I understand that times and tastes change, but this museum seems to have lost its way. I don’t want to spend my time reading information boards when I visit a museum. A book read in the comfort of my own home will accomplish that. I want to see the animals, the skeletons, the marvellous collections which have now been replaced with child-friendly interactive displays, for at the core of any museum should be the exhibits, surely?We had planned to make a day of our visit, but after a few, disappointing hours we moved on next door to the vastly superior V&A. Unless something drastic changes we shan’t return, and that is a very great shame.",Great history.. great museum 
"December 31, 2018","Have to say that this museum was one of the best museums I have ever visited.This museum has it all specially if you are interested in animals, birds and giant mammals! ",Loved it - afain
"December 24, 2018","Came here for the Wildlife Photographer of the Year, as I try to do once a year. I love the atmosphere and the photo exhibition is well worth it. Get tickets in advance, it is very difficult to get tickets in the spot.",Nice Museum
"December 23, 2018","Short trip to this museum. A nice, well maintained, educate. Kiddos love it a lot... 👍Especially dino and mamoth..: 🙏",The best place to take your kids and family!
"December 20, 2018",This was our first time in NhM and we were really delighted with the dinosaur section as well as the mammals one. The kids are loving the museum and they become really interested in learning about this prehistoric era. Don’t miss it!,Huge Collection of Minerals
"December 8, 2018","I am a lover of crystals and minerals, and this was the main reason for my visit, and I wasn't disappointed.  I have been to the Swedish Natural History Museum, but this one seemed much bigger in terms of size and its collection.  Mineral lovers would love this place, and I would have been able to spend a day or more in its mineral section alone.  The souvenir shop also sells minerals at very reasonable prices, and I picked up a few here as well.",An Education of Natural History
"December 2, 2018","The Museum of Natural History is such a huge educational value!  Admission is free and they suggest a donation of five euros. The exhibition is phenomenal as you are able to become acquainted with dinosaurs, birds, the earth with it's earthquakes, volcanoes, minerals,   the ocean, etc.!There are plenty of restaurants and gift shops!You and your family will have a grand time. ",Unbelievable
"November 27, 2018",The museum which impressed me the most in London only because of that building. You have to see that in real.,Loved the Dinosaurs exhibit
"November 18, 2018",No entry fee however the staff reminds you to make a donation for the museumWent on a Sunday good place to take kids alongHad a good time ... but from all other exhibits really enjoyed the Dinosaur exhibit...seeing all the fossils recovered from the past which inform us about the dinosaurs is amazingWorth a visit when in LondonPosting pics for all to see for themselves ,Must vusit
"November 15, 2018","If you have young children, then you cannot afford to miss this place! So much well-preserved and well presented information in one place with so many interactive games to help the young ones engaged. Highly recommend the red and the blue zones. Dinosaur sections are always a big hit. We dined at their Dino themed restaurant and my kid thoroughly enjoyed. Winter carnival right outside, was an added blessing!",Fabulous
"November 13, 2018","Very well done; typically ""natural history"" museums are overwhelmingly focused on things for children to make noises with and play with; not too bad here. Highly recommend going early on a weekday; we mistakenly did not and struggled with the crowds a little bit. Be sure to notice and appreciate the building itself, which is absolutely amazing.",WOW!!! Just Amazing!!!
"March 31, 2020","You would have to spend all day here to see everything. It took me 2 hours just to see one section out of four, I didn't even dawdle or read everything. There was one section that I just skimmed through quickly. This place has exactly the kind of stuff I was looking for. I did make time another day to go back and see a little more but as my trip was almost over I couldn't see everything that I wanted. This museum is great for kids and adults. I would say this was the best museum I've been to in the UK and Europe.",很大
"March 25, 2020",坐地鐵前往很方便，而且博物館是免費。附近還有Victoria and Albert Museum及Science Museum，也是免費的。博物館所恐龍館非常吸引。門口的藍鯨也非常震撼。,Big and informative collection
"March 23, 2020","I would recommend to show this place to your kids - informative, interesting, and rich collection about geology, dinosaurs, humans, and much more. Of course, adults will like this place too, I promise.",Beautiful atmosphere. Disappointed by some aspects.
"March 21, 2020","The atmosphere is amazing. One feels like one is transported back to the 19th century. Well worth a visit. I was disappointed by the dinosaur section. Although the emphasis is put on education, the skeletons are mostly suspended above the walkway and not so easily visible. There is a definite effort to move away from a stuffy old museum layout towards a modern educational experience for youngsters (and adults), but doesn’t one come to this museum to be plunged into the old stuffy, dusty era of the great British discoveries and expeditions? That was just my own personal desire, so I’m not complaining.HOWEVER I was shocked to discover that there was absolutely no entomological section in the museum. There is a “creepy crawly” exhibit which is only educational. I wanted to see show cases of some of the world’s millions of fabulous fascinating insects. It took me a long time to discover there weren’t any, I asked one young employee where the entomological Section was. She said “the what?’. I asked another young staff member the same thing. She said “entomology. Is that insects?” and directed me towards a part of the museum where there were volcanoes. In the end someone told me that insects were no longer on display for the last few decades. Such a shame!",A true gem
"March 20, 2020",Exactly as you’d expect – truly amazing but horrendously busy; to the point where it was difficult to move around without simply being carried along in a constant surge of people.,Amazing collection
"March 20, 2020","All I can say same thing: This is one of a number of brilliant museums in London, and one of the best I have visited anywhere.  It is free to enter, but donations are encouraged and gratefully received.  It has some amazing collections and exhibitions covering most aspects of life on earth and its history.  They provide the general public of all ages with a very stimulating and thought provoking educational experience.  It is housed in a beautiful old building with generous spaces and elaborate architecture.  Enjoy the special shows, such as the Wildlife photographer of the year exhibition (for a fee), and replenish afterwards in their pleasant coffee shop cum buffet restaurant.copy.",A Must to Visit!
"March 19, 2020","From the beautiful renovations to the outside of the building to the carefully laid out exhibits the museum makes for a great day out. While we were there there were a number of school parties on a day trip to the museum. They were just mesmerised by the scope of the natural world. Cannot do it justice in one day, there is just too much to see so be selective about where you visit. It has the added advantage that it is free.l","Busy, busy, busy"
"March 18, 2020","Have visited this museum on several occasions usually to see the Wildlife Photographer exhibition or such like.The museum collections, exhibits, food and the building and staff are greatThe only downside is the amount of people - it is not a place to go if you hate your fellow man or school children in abundance!!  So go and enjoy just be aware there will be millions joining you especially at weekends!",Love it!!
"March 18, 2020",My favourite place in the world. I love the building and the exhibits are awesome. Some of it is getting old but the bits the recently revamped are awesome!!,A hugh collection.
"March 17, 2020","In my travels I have come across nothing that compares to the Natural History Museum as a museum of the Natural World. The building is impresive in itself and is seen at it's best entering by the main entance hall where a real Blue Whale skeleton hangs from the ceiling. The mammals hall nearby contains a full size model of a blue whale among it's many excellent exhibits.Other good sections include Human Evolution, and a section for Fish Amphibians and Reptiles and Mammals.Down one of the corridors runs an impressive collection of Ichthyosaur and Plesiosaur (extinct reptile) fossils.And there are there are the dinosaurs. These include motorised moving models of dinosaurs. There is also some fossil skeletons of dinosaurs, this best of which in my opinion is Sophie the stegosaurus. What I think gives Sophie such class  is not her size, she probably was not full grown in death, but the fact the skeleton overwhelmingly comes from one fossil unlike most dinosaur skeletons which seems to be mostly made plaster replacing what is not found in the ground. Oddly Sophie is held away from the main Natural History Collection in the Geology Museum part of the collection.A good feature of the museum is that you are not obliged to pay an amount for visiting you pay what you think the visit was whorth. Which is useful if you do not have time to to have say a £20 whorth of visit.",Worth a visit!
"June 30, 2018",Great dinosaur exhibit and overall a very nice natural history museum. Good value as it is free with a suggested donation of only 5 GBP,Natural History Museum
"June 25, 2018",This museum was a lot of fun! They have some great exhibits including a room which looks like a small grocery store. You can experience what it would be like during an earthquake while you are in the store. They have some awesome dinosaur exhibits also! ,Fascinating “free” attraction in London
"June 16, 2018","Truly wonderful experience.  Just make sure you allocate enough time for it!  We allowed 3.5 hours and were a little rushed.  Lots of people but still easy enough to get around.Some fantastic exhibits, although some are getting dated now.  The “earth” area was great and human evolution good too.Free to enter but a little pressure applied to make a donation at the entrance. Personally paying £2 for a still water is donation enough!",What a museum!!!
"June 12, 2018","Plan to spend the day at this museum, so you won’t feel rushed. Exhibits were fantastic & very kid friendly. The dinosaur exhibit was my favorite!!  There are 3 options for lunch/snack places with on line menus.",Beautiful
"June 7, 2018","Amazing building, nice exhibits. The fact that you dont pay a ticket and can give a donation is very important to the education of the children.",Great visit
"June 6, 2018",A great place to visit and spend some time out of the busy streets. Amazing building! Free but please donate...to keep it so beautiful! ,Any science lover must visit
"June 2, 2018",If you enjoy science you have to stop here. First of all the architecture is magnificent and out of this world. Most importantly though this great Natural History museum has a wide range of different exhibitions. It's fun and not overwhelming despite it's wide variety of exhibitions. ,A very crowded visit
"June 2, 2018",Perhaps a bad day to visit as the children were on half term and it took over an hour to get in - choose your time to visit!! ,A parents dream
"May 27, 2018",We brought our 4 and three year olds to visit the dinosaurs and boy didn't they love it! We ended up visiting twice! Despite the size of the museum the children were excited and wanted to see everything. They loved the dinosaurs and to eat ast the T-Rex grill was a highlight our Dino loving boy.  We loved our day and wound recommend to anyone to visit. ,Late nights are a hit
"May 26, 2018",Decided to attend a late night opening at the Natural History Museum as a friend wanted to go. I had low expectations of a boring dull evening but how wrong could I be.The whole museum was open to visit but without the huge crowds normally seen. In addition we attended two free lectures which were very professionally arranged and highly informative. I will certainly go again and would recommend everyone to get onto the mailing list to see if any of the lectures are of interest to them. If so go and be ready to be amazed.,Dinosaurs and Blue Whale: a must for any child (and grown up children)
"January 28, 2018","Excellent free museum.Security means a long process getting in, so come during the week if you can. The Dinosaur exhibition and Blue Whale jukebox were highlights.",Dinosnores (Sleep at the museum) - not what I expected!
"January 21, 2018","I purchased the Dinosnores as a special Holiday present for our family knowing that my kids were on the older side for this (9 & 12).  I don’t know why, but I imagined a small group of families having a magical camping/explorer adventure in the museum.  Maybe I got that idea because Dinosnores had been sold out for months when I first tried to book it?  We arrived and were faced with typical London queues and masses of people (500) at registration for the event, including large school groups!  Not the cozy event I had wrongly expected.  Arriving in Hintze Hall, we were greeted rather coldly and condescendingly by one of the staff and assigned a sleeping spot.  I was so glad we had brought our own inflatable camping mats as they only provided yoga mats.  We then were ordered to go to our first activity.  I understand that an event of this size is a Health & Safety nightmare and needs clearly communicated rules, but the military style of our leader was really off-putting.  The first activity was a rules briefing and science presentation about dinosaurs which led into a torch-lit exploration of the fossil section.  This was cool and enjoyable, although my kids had figured out at this point that they were not the target audience and started having a bad attitude...We were then bossed around by our strict leader to the eating area to eat our home-brought snack.  She wouldn’t allow us to sit where we wanted to keep her assigned group together.  We just wanted a booth, but had to sit right next to it, at a table.Next we saw a very entertaining and well-presented science talk at one of the theatres in the museum.  The two female staff scientists were engaging and really good and we learned a lot.We really wanted to go to sleep at this point (23h) and should have, but felt that we wanted to get our money’s worth, so moved on to the third activity of the night: T-shirt drawing.  My kids sleepily drew a dinosaur on a shirt.I assume they do three activities to tire everyone out, so no one gets any silly ideas and just falls into bed at midnight.It was cold and extremely drafty in Hintze Hall and they woke us at 7am, when we had to immediately pack up camp and go to breakfast.  Definitely bring your own as the one they provide is disgusting.My family was so over-tired that they wanted to go home before the animal show, but I convinced them to stay if we left right after and if they didn’t “have to” explore the museum before it opens its doors to the general public.The animal show was good, but we were all sleep-deprived and wanted to go home.  I’ve learned that a good-night’s sleep is really important to my family and that my kids are too old for this kind of thing!All of us felt that it was not really worth it for our family.   I do think a more warm welcome would have made for a better experience.",Great place to take the children
"January 20, 2018",A wealth of displays that will interest/entertain any child (or adult).  With very helpful staff who will help you find your way around too.  Watch out for the queues at busy times.,Bring back Dippy
"January 18, 2018",I would enjoy it even more if they were to give back the stolen Parthenon Marbles. Moving Dippy the diplodocus was a mistake.,A must see!
"January 7, 2018","The British Museum of Natural History is an absolute gem. To do this great museum justice, plan to spend the day. It's well worth the time.",Educational museum with free entry
"January 2, 2018",A very educational museum. Great for young and teenager children. Its a big museum that you can spend at least half a day there if you cover everything there. There's a donation box if you choose to donate.,Very interesting 
"December 31, 2017",I personally think that this place is wonderful for both adults and kids! You can easily spend a good 3 hours in here.,Very interesting 
"December 29, 2017","Amazing and interesting. Saw the dinosaurs and venom exhibit. The whale was amazing. Too much to see for one visit. Big queue, but it moves fast, half hour wait. Worth it ",Family day out
"December 22, 2017","It is free but they encourage you to make a minimum of £5 per person donation at the entrance. The range of exhibits are huge and to fully appreciate all, I suggest at least 3 hours. Some of the exhibits require paid tickets to enter. There are enough free exhibits around to spend your time there.",Very nice especially for children
"December 20, 2017",Very nice museum.  I think more a child than an adults pleasure. A lot to do for the children and shops mainly have toys for them. Still worth the visit.,mammoth of knowledge! 
"June 21, 2017","An amazing museum to see, observe and develop an amazing understanding of variety of genres. The entry to the museum is free. The museum is broadly divided into several sections and one can visit the section depending upon convenience. Efforts have  been made to emphasise on activity based learning to inculcate a better understanding! Totally loved this place. If given a chance, shall surely come back :) ",Must see!
"June 21, 2017",I couldn't see it but my wife & 4yr old daughter visited it and loved it! It's huge with lots of interesting stuff for children too..,Love this museum
"June 9, 2017","Everybody can explore the science behind the Aurora Pyramid of Hope, an unrivalled collection of 296 coloured diamonds. It was interesting to see the secrets of life and death in London over 5,000 years. 3 hours it's not enought to see all the exhibitions and attractions.",Family-friendly top attraction 
"June 1, 2017",A family-friendly museum and a-must visit. Free admission.  It has collections and exhibits including dinosaur skeletons and millions of specimens from around the world. They organised small group talk on specific topic. We attended the interesting session on butterflies.  There are charges for special exhibitions. Access via South Kensington station. ,Love love love this museum
"May 31, 2017",Had a good time walking the halls of this museum. Fascinating exhibits of dinosaurs and other extinct animals. Particularly love the volcanic displays and suppositions about how the world was created.,Good Museum and entertaining!
"May 26, 2017","The Natural History Museum is a good museum but I would say it is more designed for kids than anything else. Make sure you consider this if you're planning on visiting a lot of museums in London and the time is short.They have great exhibitions but most of them are for kids to play and learn. And Don't get my wrong... adults can have a great time as well but considering my previous experience with other museums I know it will cause a great impact on children.They have awesome fossils and the Mammals section is great. Make sure you check the Darwin Center and the Whales exhibitions...The Gardens are simply great... beautiful place and the architecture, like many other London public buildings, is amazing!Admission is free but you can donate some pounds to this cool place if you like! You can move around the place and visit V&A museum and the Science Museum as well... they are located next to each other!You can get here by bus and by Underground (stop at South Kensington station) but you'll have to walk a little bit... not too much!",Dinosaurs a must see
"May 15, 2017",Nice museum. Great dinosaur exhibits. Museum is free and houses educational exhibits. Several study areas. Mammals is another very nice display. ,Every time with new eyes
"May 1, 2017",Considering the huge lots of culture you get for free in a neat and tidy place I can only recommend that everyone visits the Museum. Couple of hours will do if in a hurry.,Very good free museum
"April 30, 2017","Like many other London museums, this one is free. Special exhibits have a fee. Highlights include the dinosaur exhibit, which includes some of the most complete skeletons and a T-Rex and other dinosaur animatronics; a simulation of the 1995 Kobe Japan earthquake, and many hands-on displays throughout. Multiple gift shops and eateries on premise. Can get very crowded. It was a good rainy day stop for us. As others have said, the line/ queue to enter can be VERY long, but do not be deterred. It does move very quickly and is relatively painless. World class museum.",Great for kids
"April 27, 2017","Dinosaurs section is a must, but other sections are also very good. If you go with kids, I recommend to go as soon as it opens at 10, since the queue got a bit longer when we were leaving and you need a couple of hours to visit everything.",Amazing building 
"December 19, 2017","The Architect that’s gone into this building is truly magnificent !  I found myself looking up at the building more than the history inside.   I have been a thew times now and always something new.  I can not believe it’s free to get in either,  so contribution towards the upkeep is always something I help towards.    You could spend your whole day in here if needed, it’s so big. The Dinosaur area really is amazing to see. At Christmas time the ice-rink is one of the best I have seen and very pretty with all the trees and centre piece lit up round the rink. No trip to London is complete without visiting this museum, and made even more special at xmas time. ",One of the best Museum !!!
"November 10, 2017",My visit to this museum was so pleasant! One of the best museum of neutral history I have been. I will recommend it. If you have children do not miss this museum. Your kids will love it!!!,Longon gem!
"November 7, 2017",It's the second time I go to the museum and I still enjoy it very much. Great for kids and adults of all ages. It is incredible how there can be a museum like this with free entrance! It is undoubtedly one of London's greatest attractions.,Loved it!
"November 5, 2017","A must -visit. I'd say that if I had to visit only 1 museum, I'd pick the Natural History Museum. Also because I simply love the architecture of the building.  I was completely in awe. ",Must go place! 
"October 10, 2017","It was the first place we visited in London and we spent almost a full day there. So much to see and really interesting exhibits. My son loved the experience. We went near Christmas season, there was an ice-skating rink on the ground of the museum. Highly recommended! ",If you're looking for a new pram
"October 4, 2017",This museum is insanely busy and there seems to be nothing in the way of ensuring too many people aren't crammed in. Once you see past that you see the below par exhibits. The dinosaur section was really poor in terms of the others I've seen across the UK and in Europe. In fact by far the most interesting experience was walking around the shop and flicking through books. The place just comes across as massively underfunded. I just don't see why they don't just charge a fee for non UK national tourists. Everywhere else in europe you spend 50 percent of your money on getting into museums. Plus it might make the museum able to create better facilities and exhibitions. So to sum it up. Go here if you want to spend an hour or two dodging prams whilst trying to have a look at below par exhibitions.,Whale expedition 
"October 3, 2017",First time in Natural history museum and I was amazed! Building architecture taken my breath away and when we entry it I lost my words too. Welcoming staff and amazing giraffe with its scallop - Wau! And it was just a beginning. We spend a lot of time in body expedition where we found too many interesting fact about our bodies. Whale expedition was unbelievable!! Everything so nicely organised and you can also play around with the bottoms ! Just perfect experience for us. Definitely will come back! ,Stunning and amazing.
"September 27, 2017","Looking at my watch as I reached the end of the exhibits I could not believe that over four and a half hours had flown by. Visiting the Natural History Museum was amazing, educational, fascinating and full of intriguing exhibits. I especially enjoyed the volcano, earthquakes, human ancestors, whales, dinosaurs, and giant sequoia exhibits. There are plenty of cafes so you can pit stop for a tasty scone with jam and clotted cream, like I did.",What a let down.  A theme park pretending to be a museum
"September 21, 2017","This museum has so much going for it, with some world class exhibits, some not able to be seen elsewhere, and then ruins it by trying to be a theme park for attention seeking dumbed down kids.  How patronising.  The museum assumes we want to be entertained rather than educated.  Huge disappointment.  Cannot properly see important fossils, and important and culturally sensitive finds are treated like circus extras.  Will not go back while they treat me like a dumbed down TV addict.","Amazing museum, not to be missed"
"September 13, 2017","I love a good museum and this is one of the greats! The building itself is so beautiful and you could probably spend a day just looking at the intricacies of the architecture and decoration of the stone work. You do need to have your bag searched on the way in but this is just a sign of the times and once you're in, it's not something you need to worry about again. (Personally I think it's a small price to pay to protect the safety of visitors and the priceless and historical exhibits)We spent 5 hours here and still didn't get to see everything but I would be so happy to go again. There are some ""copied"" exhibits but this didn't bother me so much as everything is so carefully cared for and laid out. There is a fountain of knowledge on so many subjects, I would have got lost for days reading every snippet of information. The stuffed animals can make you feel a little uncomfortable but I'm guessing that's why some of them are models. I have visited this museum previously as a child and remember it as a boring place with rooms full of bugs and stones on display but the improvements since then are amazing. Many of the displays are now interactive and some of the models move. They have clearly tried to make the museum more relevant and I believe they have achieved this while still remaining true to its roots. We didn't eat here but that was only because we had planned to eat elsewhere in London, not because it was to expensive or the food was unappealing. The toilets were clean and had attendants. The staff were helpful and knowledgeable.A great day, not to be missed!",Beautiful place but deserve more maintenance!
"March 20, 2017",Building is just amazing! It is very complete museum but pity how some parts are full of dusty. Need it more maintenance! ,Great free museum!
"March 18, 2017",I loved the Dodos and all the fossils.  Definitely worth a visit.Free entry- near south kensington station.   Great museum store too.  Moon rock in a small display in the entryway.,Phenomenal and Immense Museum
"March 16, 2017","This old museum of ancient delights has the cathedral-like 1880 Victorian building which is an unforgettable landmark. This architectural wander’s columns crawl with carved monkeys imaginatively clinging to the terra-cotta and floras sidling across ceiling panels. If you visit London this a must visit place, charming and incredibly huge museum.Few tips that could be helpful for a great visit :1.	The quickest way to get to the museum is to go to South Kensington station by London Underground and it is about five minutes' walk away.2.	Skip the main Cromwell Road door and use the small entrance on Exhibition Road, as it’s the quietest and step-free. 3.	The best way to skip the crowds is to arrive early in morning.4.	The Cromwell Road entrance leads to Dinosaurs, Creepy Crawlies, the Blue Whale, the Darwin Centre and the Wildlife Garden.5.	The Exhibition Road entrance is closer to Volcanoes and Earthquakes and the giant Earth model.6.	The new Darwin Centre has 22 million insect and plant specimens are takes nearly 17 miles of shelving.7.	Visitors under 7 years can take advantage of a FREE Explorer Backpack near the entrance of the Central Hall (must have valid I.D.). Included are kid-size binoculars and explorer’s hat, an activity booklet, magnifying glass, drawing kit, recording sheets and clipboard, plus clues to help complete a challenge.8.	School-age children ages 5 to 11 years can purchase self-led discovery guides with challenges and discussion topics for £1 each, also at the visitor’s information desk in the Central Hall.9.	You can take a free behind-the-scenes tour which last about 45 minutes. Numbers are limited, need to book at the information desk in the Central Hall.10.	Check the afterhours events, including evening gallery tours, night safari, late Fridays (extended hours, with snacks and drinks available - every last Friday of the month, excluding December) and even sleep-overs in the Natural History Museum.11.	Entry is free, but you need to buy a ticket for the IMAX Theatre, flight simulators and some special exhibitions.",Absolutely great!
"March 9, 2017","Went there with my granddaughter, 3 years old, she was enchanted with the dinosaurs, the big whale and, even with the spiders. The big stair going through the center of the Earth was also very good, we had to go up many times.It is an amazing place to make children get  interest in science.Recommend for sure!",A Sunday outing
"February 20, 2017","From the queuing at the side entrance onwards it turned into a location from hell! People don't have any level of courtesy left in them, we were pushed, shoved and bearded through the exhibition areas like 'Penguins in s huddle'. If you wanted to stop you were shoved, if you tried to get close to an exhibit you were moaned at and if you tried to pause then all hell broke loose around you for being so inconsiderate. People with pushchairs use them like pathfinder rams to make headway and most of the time they are empty. The museum is clearly trying to fit as many people through the doors as possible but to the detriment of visitor experience. DO NOT VISIT ON THE WEEKEND... ",Free day out
"February 20, 2017","We visited the last day of half term and got there for opening time and queued for around five minutes to get in. ( FYI on the way out the queue was HUGE and they were staggering entry).Overall we had a lovely day, the museum itself while grand and iconic.. we felt a little disappointing.Lots of displays were models or casts and generally it lost its authenticity. We did enjoy parts especially as some were relevant to DD school studies.Don't think we will be visiting again, although this time the Dippy was out on tour so maybe...Also the display cases and cabinets were quite dirty some with THICK layers of dust.. toilets also quite grim. We always take a picnic but passing through the cafe a small child's lunch box £5, cans of drink £2, grapes £2.75! Very dearNHM.. overall you could do better. Average rating ",Educational and entertaining!
"February 15, 2017",A must visit for people of all ages (& kids too!). Extremely interesting and well laid out with a great cafeteria too!,Disappointingly static
"February 13, 2017","Have to admit this was a huge disappointment. Growing up in Sydney this place had a huge reputation do we were really looking forward to taking the kids,but they hated it . It was hugely crowded with adults even on a sunny day with next to no kids which should have been a giveaway. Although it gets a tick for being free the displays were static and dull . Don't bother with primary school age kids",It might be alright if there weren't any children
"February 9, 2017","The museum is undergoing a large refurbishment. You are unable to orientate yourself because the main entrance is closed. The numbers of children make it impossible to enjoy, as you are almost shoved out of the way. I went there last as a child and really enjoyed the memories, but now it is not really adult friendly and to say we were disappointed is an understatement. It was hot and noisy, with children making progress almost impossible. The V&A next door is a 5* attraction, as is British Museum. The whole experience has left my wife and me totally disillusioned and we will probably never return. The problem seems to be that our museums are being transformed into an ""experience"" for one particular group, to the detriment of others. I will therefore content myself with gaining knowledge from books - you know those papery things with a binder down one edge!",Great space
"February 5, 2017",With a number of other museums and definitely worth the visit as the space alone is beautiful and grand.,Wonderful experience
"January 24, 2017",Had a wonderful time in the museum especially the interactive portions of the museum. There is a lot to learn and see keep atleast 4 to 5 hours for your visit. I was not able to visit the photography exhibition that was going on but despite that there is enough to keep you busy. There are cafes and a restaurant inside to take rest in between the museum tour. All in all a very good experience and what makes it even better is that it is free to enter. :-),Fantastic Museum
"January 11, 2017",Absolutely loved our visit to this museum. Artifacts are so well displayed and easy to view. Highly recommended.,Must see for people that likes biology and natural sciences
"January 1, 2017","For people that likes biology this museum will be preferred from the British Museum. I think that both should be visited in your trip to London. Prepare to walk at least half day (10 am to 4 pm), no audio guides available but plenty of interactive attractions.",Very good
"December 15, 2016","It was very interesting and I learned a lot!! I loved the part of the dinosaurs, there was a huge T. rex that moves!",Interesting!
"November 27, 2016",Although it was very crowded and lots of kids I still enjoyed the exhibits at this museum.  Beautiful architecture too!,A must visit
"November 27, 2016",This museum is everything other reviewers have recommended or for. My only reservation is that because it's so popular it's sometimes tricky to actually see some of the exhibits because it's so busy. I'd recommend trying to find out it's quieter times especially in the paid for exhibitions. The photography awards exhibition was very crowded but also wonderful and the highlight of our visit.  ,Choose the visit time carefully
"November 27, 2016","Despite the review title, we didn't and it took about 30 minutes to get to the door (11 ish on a Sunday).The escalator through the earth's crust is smart. Quite warm and busy in the upper galleries though. Highlight has to be the diplodocus and the architecture in the room it's in. Truly stunning. The dinosaur exhibition area is brilliant and well worth a visit.Wear good shoes (for walking) and don't rush. You could easily spend a few days exploring the whole place.The cafes get busy but you can take your own food in. If you have the family it's a good way to eat.",So big and exhaustive you would get lost
"November 19, 2016",The Natural History Museum is really impressive. Everything you want to know about the diversity of wildlife through the ages is there. We couldn't see everything within 2 hours and had to go. And we want to come back see the rest. And you know what? It's free! But donate please.,"It's everything, literally. "
"November 2, 2016",A truly amazing collection of our discovery of things over the ages.Check for school holidays as it can get very busy.,Amazing just go there !
"November 1, 2016","Simply beautiful, amazing, if you like history this is the place for you. Also worth going there with your kids because of the T-Rex!And moreover, it's absolutely free !",Natural History Museum Dino Snores for kids
"July 20, 2015","We have just spent the night at the Natural History Museum having a Dinosaur themed sleepover.  I booked for myself, my husband and of course the kids!  There were around 500 children and adults we started of the evening getting our sleeping area sorted out.  We were put into teams we were stegosaurus reds and we were allocated sleeping in the main hall.  Top tip don't be too eager to sleep under the dinosaur as it never gets really dark.  We went into one of the alcoves and near the back corner where it was quiet and dark.  Another tip take a sleeping mat as they provide one but its so thin and you are sleeping on a stone floor so very uncomfortable.  We started off the evening with a fantastic science show ""creatures from the deep""  which was fantastic lots of jars of very unusual deep sea fish.  Was fun informative and interactive really enjoyed it.  Then snack time followed by a dinosaur hunt in the dark with torches.  Finally the evening concluded with  a T shirt making activity for the kids where they design a dinosaur T shirt to take home.  Lights out at midnight I must admit none of us slept very well and we were a bit shattered in the morning.  After a light breakfast we had the animal man and he was fantastic lots of audience participation and the animals were unusual and varied also they were not manhandled the children could stroke them but handling was limited and the animals welfare was obviously the first priority which was lovely to see.   We don't live locally so had booked a hotel nearby for the Sunday  but couldn't check in till 1pm so if you have to hang around for a while like we did it can be a bit hard as we all wanted to go back to bed. The experience was amazing and I would highly recommend,   its a one off wonderful thing to do and the kids and you will never forget it.",Fascinating place. Beautiful building. 
"July 7, 2015",I spent an interesting and enjoyable few hours inside this magnificent building. It really is a beautiful building both inside and out. The main entrance hall is stunning. I arrived at around 10am on a Monday morning to find really long queues at the main entrance but I walked round to the side entrance on exhibition road where there were no queues at all. There was an escalator that took you right from the ground floor to the top that was made to resemble you going up into a planet. I can't describe it but it's breathtaking. The exhibits in this museum are really enjoyable and so worth seeing. There is no entrance fee payable but like the other museums in the area they just ask for a voluntary contribution towards the upkeep of the museum. Definitely a must visit place. N.B. Visit the Japanese supermarket replica area for a few minutes for a little surprise! ,Impressive museum!
"July 7, 2015","Amazing museum, with an awesome collection of dinosaurs, plus great exhibitions of modern animals. Several temporary exhibitions are presented across the year, usually worth-visiting. Look for the Wildlife Garden, accessible from the Darwin Centre (cocoon) exit. The garden is a little paradise, where you'll be able to experience British biodiversity  ",One of the best museum in the UK
"June 29, 2015","Although I like the Museum of Natural History (in New York) much more than the Natural History Museum, but this is still one of the best museum we have in this country.The museum is basically divided into 4 zones and split into 3 floors. There is a lot to see here and you can easily spend a whole day at the museum without getting bored. My favourites are the blue, red and green zones as I really like the Earth, dinosaurs, reptiles, mammals, insects sections. I also like the solar system on the 1st floor (Earth section) but I feel this department seriously need some updated as it hasn't changed for at least 10 years. Comparing to the museum in New York, ours is too simple and too brief as it could explore a little more, i.e. looking into our galaxy and universe. However, I really like the constellations on wall (at the Earth entrance). The dinosaurs section is also another highlight at the museum and I think those dinosaurs display is brilliant! The earthquake section also need some updating as well as it hasn't changed for a very long time as well.Their biggest let down is their food hall. The food is expensive and do not provide enough choices. Overall, its free of charge (although there is a donation box at the entrance) so this is definitely a ""must see"" in London.Tips: i) try to avoid visit the museum during school holiday & half term as this place can be nightmare when it is overcrowded.ii) use the entrance on the Exhibition road can save you time for queuing.",Coral Reef Exhibition
"June 6, 2015",As a keeper of marine aquatics i was so looking forward to coming here to look at all the corals and displays as shown on the website and YouTube!Save your money and go down your local fish shops people they will be better stocked and lots more to see!!They only had one live tank roughly 1000ltr and everything else was dead coral on display!Very dissapointing and not worth the £50 to get there and the £20 to get in!!,Amazing! great for family.
"May 20, 2015","Lots of display on Dinosaurs Animals and Nature! Too many might take slightly longer time to understand some, but is for all ages to enjoy! Was there during long weekend, long queue but it did not take too long to get in.Is a Must See.",Temple of the History of Natural History!
"May 7, 2015","This museum is amazing, not only for its rich collection and stunning building, but also for  being a great part of the history of Biology and Natural History studies. A must have experience in London.Love it!",More Time
"April 25, 2015","London is awesome.  Need more time.  Some locations have long, long corridors.  The day I bus hopped to the museums I walkes.  Over 10 miles in one day.Need to pace self for the trip and be aware of delays due to lines.",WOW
"April 20, 2015",Been to the smoke many times before yet never visited.....what a error!Will be going back again and again!Great place to visit please don't make the same error as I had and visit soon.,Dino Snores for Adults
"April 18, 2015","We've just spent the night at the NHM for this event. From the moment we walked through the doors to the moment we left this morning, we couldn't have asked for a more fantastic experience. To sum up: the staff were great and so passionate about their jobs and the museum itself, the building was a magical backdrop for the exhibits, the entertainment was so enjoyable and relaxed, we could take part in as much or as little as we liked, everything was so geared to giving us a wonderful experience and we couldn't have asked for more. The exhibits themselves were very well displayed and looked after.  As a side note, we had seen Chi Chi and Guy at London Zoo when we were children, and to see them exhibited again, although sad in some ways, was a happy trip back for us.The food was very tasty and plentiful, as was the tea and coffee. Being able to wander through the galleries at night with very few people was a dream come true, and then watch Jurassic Park at 3am was almost surreal. There was a harpist playing the most beautiful music for a couple of hours and so we all were able to relax and soak up the atmosphere whilst laying in our beds looking at Dippy! You must put this experience on your top ten of things to do ever!",Dated exhibits but worth the visit
"February 3, 2020","It’s beautiful, and worth going to for the building alone. But a lot of the exhibitions are looking really tired and in need of some update. The human lab in particular needs some modernization. The geological exhibits were much more interesting and certainly felt current (maybe its the taxidermy on the biology side of the museum that gives it that dated feel as well). I loved the main hall and the volcano/earthquake exhibit especially, maybe that’s the Californian in me ;)",Short visit but worth it
"February 3, 2020","I only had an hour to visit the museum so I didn't have the time to see all the exhibits, but the ones that I did (minerals, the vault, Heinze Hall) were amazing. I can't wait to return with my children to show them this excellent place.",Great but so so busy 
"February 2, 2020","The museum itself here is good, but it is swarmed with kids and people to the point that you’re moving along in such a crowd you barely get to stop and take anything in. The building is incredible and top advice would be go in off peak times to enjoy this amazing free place.",Busy busy busy
"February 2, 2020","Think the crowds took the edge off the visit as many things were blocked, would have loved to have had a real good look around ",Entertainment for everybody.
"February 2, 2020","This is my favorite museum in London. The vastness of different exhibitions will suit interest of every visitor, and above everything else, the building itself is a beautiful wonder. Tip for those who are planning to visit, go there as early as possible, as it is getting quite crowded closer to lunchtime.",Great museum
"February 2, 2020","This is a great museum. Our 7 year daughter loved it. We arrived just after 10 on Saturday morning and had no problem to get in straight away,no queues. It started to get much busier after awhile. We spent 4 hours there,but you could easily spend all day if you wanted. Taking to consideration that it's free of charge I highly recommend it to families with young children.",History at its best 
"February 2, 2020",Finally managed to visit the Natural History museum.The museum is a must visit location in London. It’s very informative with lots of staff available for consultation. There’s also loads of interactive features to keep you involved.You can easily spend half a day visiting ,Nice building with 2 other museum in vicinity
"February 2, 2020","The gemstone exhibits are really awesome. The skeleton of the blue whale, the dinosaur are well displayed as well. The kids would love it.",1 checked of bucket list 
"February 2, 2020",Wanted to go since I was a child well today it happened and it was everything I expected really enjoyable just walking though the front doors wow my only disappointment was dippy was on tour but everything else wow ,Amazing

"December 13, 2014",Came here after Winter wonderland cancelled (and refunded) our tickets (due to unusually warm weather they said!)...This place is just Awesome! If ur not on time u can miss out on 10 mins of skate time due to the queue...5*,My favourite place ever.
"December 3, 2014","Please bare in mind I am a fossil and natural history enthusiast. I think I have included most of the facts towards the end. Whenever I have a bit of free time in London I go to the NHM mostly alone because I like a good hard long look at everything, and then some. Even before you go inside you notice the architecture is fabulous and the stone work has been greatly considered and designed. Talking of stone work, my favourite bit is the geology section located on the 2nd floor (I think). The diamond display is awesome, some of them light up fluorescent under uv light. Also in this section I learned that chalk is comprised of planktonic skeletons, when you write on a chalk board just remember you are writing with thousands of compressed bones from sea fairing organisms from back in the day. I digress.The only problems with NHM is that there are only 24 hours in the day, the 2nd problem is sometimes the toilet facilities get quite busy.You can see newly extinct species like the dodo from their fabulous taxidermy range. Not on sale in Primark. The fact that they're at the museum is truly wonderful. But, looking at its' body you realise you are looking at one of the last preserved dodos in existence, that's the bit that makes me sad.Natural science is absolutely invaluable to the progression of human kind and this museum has taught me so much through the years. Their exhibitions are incredible if you manage to catch a good one. If you can go to the after hours that's the one you want.10/10 I love it! It's not for everyone but everyone will find something they like about the NHM.",Worth the visit. Very crowded
"October 13, 2014",Visited the museum while in London with our 8month son. We waited for around 20minutes in the rain to enter the museum. We didn't want to miss it and didn't have time to return if we had left. The exhibits are really interesting. We walked around the museum with our baby in the stroller with no major issues.The only problem we noticed was that the various themed halls had only one door to be used as an entrance or exit. This creates some issues since the museum is usually quite crowded. Having the stroller with us somehow got us more space to move around and people helped us. The dinosaurs are of course amazing. The huge whale is amazing. I can't think of something not interesting. You can spend hours in the museum but the whole ambience and the crowd don't really allow you to enjoy the whole experience. I guess when our son is older and if we return to London we will revisit the museum for him to enjoy the exhibits.,Geology Museum
"August 26, 2014","Back in the day the Geology Museum used to be a separate entity around the corner from the Natural History Museum.  At some point it was subsumed by it's larger neighbour.  However, it still maintains a separate entrance which does not suffer from the huge queues of the Natural History Museum.  The Geology Museum still maintains its separate exhibits and areas.  It's incredibly interesting, particularly the exhibit of the evolution of the earth.  The interactive earthquake is fun whilst the precious jewels section is stunning.  It is much more manageable than the Natural History Museum and a lot less crowded, even during school holidays.  As a treat, I suggest the self-service restaurant across the road at the Victoria and Albert Museum.",Very disappointing
"August 24, 2014","I had wonderful memories of visiting as a child but taking my own son was a very disappointing experience. We queued to get into the museum itself and fought our way through the crowds to the dinosaur exhibit, where we were very disappointed to find we had to queue again. What was worse was that this queue was basically the exhibit -- you just stand in a big line shuffling slowly past the bones. It felt like a very unimaginative, old-school approach to a supposedly world-class museum exhibit.We gave up and went next door to the Science Museum instead, where we walked straight in and had a fantastic time with all the hands-on, interactive exhibits. Maybe someone from the Natural History Museum should pop round to their neighbour and learn a few things?",A Totally Enjoyable day
"August 17, 2014",The city should be so proud of this beautiful building! Its an absolute treasure Staff are pleasant and very helpful! Its contents are visually stunning and there I so much to take in it also demands a second visit!,Appalling
"August 15, 2014","If I could give it no marks I would. We were prepared for a queue and to deal with rainy weather but to be treated with the total lack of care was a shock. At a very early point in the queuing process we were approached by people selling membership to allow fast tracking (£83 for a family for a facility that is meant to be free to enter). We had queued for almost an hour and were waiting in the square with a lawn when we realised that at the rate of progress we were making it would be another hour before we would get inside.  As we left the queue we passed the main entrance and noticed that there appeared to be no queue nearby. We were told that there had been a fire alarm and when I complained to a member of staff that we had been held in a queue in the lawned square for nearly an hour with no information about the fire alarm, the additional waiting time and in general both staff members were obviously completely unaware that there were any people queuing there at all. Complaint was met with the stock answer that ""we are sorry but we are extremely busy"". Our experience throughout was similar at other ""attractions"" in London. Long queues and a fast track process to rip off the public that when I inquired further meant only a 10 minute saving of time at the London Eye. How did London stage a successful Olympic Games? If those jokers can do it so could anybody. ",Insane queues!
"August 14, 2014","I loved the Natural History Museum as a child, but apparently visiting in school holidays is now a no-no. Arrived at 12 o'clock to join the end of a queue just to get in. It looked at first like a fairly short queue but after we'd stood in it for 15 minutes we realised that it went past the entrance, snaked round several times on itself before coming back. We stood in it for 40 minutes, then suddenly there was a mass exodus from the museum, with people trying to get out through the queue we were in, and the queue stopped moving. Added to that, the heavens opened and it poured with rain. So we're all standing out in the rain, half the people are trying to leave, half the people are trying to get in, it's total chaos and there's nobody around to tell us what on earth is going on. I guess maybe the fire alarms went off or something?  If that was the case, fair enough it can't be helped, but it would have been sensible to let the people standing outside in the rain know what was going on and that they weren't going to get into the museum anytime soon so they could go away and do something more productive with their lives. As it was, we spent an hour standing around for no reason, and we all got soaked!",Big let down
"August 11, 2014","Huge queues, got access through rear entrance to avoid queues. Dated exhibits, most interactive displays not working, a lot of the displays looked knocked together in a garage with plywood and glue. Yes there are some jaw dropping exhibits, but the general feeling is of a giant public school biology lab from the Fifties.","hot, busy, kids loved it"
"August 9, 2014","Having read reviews I felt somewhat intrepid about visiting NHM on a hot Saturday during school hols. Yes it was busy, and yes it was hot in places but overall we enjoyed the visit.  With children aged 2 and 5 we didn't aim to 'do it all' - but wanted to see the dinosaurs, the blue whale and then whatever we came across. Kids loved the dinosaur exhibition - I was a little underwhelmed by the moving T rex but my 2 year old found it suitably scary, so probably pitched about right! We went up to the volcano and earthquake area first - they liked the escalator (there are very few where we live so this (and going on the tube escalators) was very exciting for them!). It was very hot and crowded there but the imitation earthquake was good and they were fascinated by the videos of earthquakes and tsunamis. Blue whale was impressive and lots of other animals that they recognised there too. Also spent a while admiring the actual building itself / main hall and staircase which is amazing (and familiar to them from 'Andy's Dinosaur Adventures on cbeebies). A few tips which helped us:Entered via Exhibition Road as less queue - it was outside the building but fast moving so only around 10-15mins.Left pushchair in the (free) cloakroom - easier without it in the crowded areasBooked (free) advance tickets for timed dinosaur slot so walked straight in past the long queue.Took our own picnic and used the basement picnic area - this was great, lots of space and cool - saves queuing and spending out on food.Take plenty of drinks - we did find a water fountain (at the back of main hall opposite toilets) so were able to refill our drink bottles too.Bought a guide map for £1, as others have commented it is useful for getting around and doubles as a fan!Take time to look at the building - beautiful details, stone carvings everywhere, lots of animals etc to spot.Don't attempt too much - we were all flagging a bit after 4+ hours and although there was lots we didn't see, felt it best to leave while the kids were still happy though tired, rather than exhausted and miserable. Hopefully can come back another time to see more.It was only around 15min walk up to Hyde Park / Kensington Gardens - a lovely end to the visit with an ice cream surrounded by greenery",A Great Time.
"April 10, 2015","Took my son here and we loved it.  Got there a bit before 10 and joined the long line.  However, once the place opened, the line moved quickly and we were soon inside. We immediately went to the Dinosaur exhibit and later were so glad we did this first, as the line for that grew immensely over the morning.All of the exhibits were great and my son immersed himself into the different halls.  I know in the end we did not see everything, but I'm sure we will return again to explore more.",Headache inducing
"April 1, 2015","Pros: Beautiful building Fab displays and facts Free Cons: The queues were simply horrendous. Particularly annoying are people generating more queues by taking selfies with the dinosaurs. Soooo irritating The dinosaur queue is not worth it. Felt like a feat of endurance to make it to the robotic trex. Then, once there, you can't stop, cos it makes a bottle neck. Kids screaming / crying /charging around. Can't read the placards if you wanted to. I agree with another reviewer: make an adults only day!!! Nothing wrong with the museum / displays / curators. It's just all about the volume of people spoiling the experience",Must see Museum
"March 29, 2015",Go to see the beautiful building and the dinasours. But once you are inside there are lots of things to see and explore.Remember the treasures and the enormous tree at the top of the stairs.Can be crowded. Free entrance.,Very interesting
"March 13, 2015","Went here to fill some time, and it was free. We looked through the Blue Zone (the dinosaurs and then human biology). Both were very interesting. There were many dinosaur fossils which were very interesting, and a lot of information about them and the lives they would have lived. Human biology was quite interesting, and the part about vision/perception was fun. I think it would be a great place for families, and I would also recommend at least half a day, if not more (we only had about 4 hours, but we do like to take our time and read everything).","Really crowded, but interesting. Check out stone creatures on the outside of the building!"
"March 10, 2015","I like that the Natural History Museum (and many museums in London) are free. Then I feel like I don't have to see every last thing in the museum to get my money's worth.  The Natural History Museum was super-crowded the day we were there. It was really crowded on the walkway that is above the dinosaur exhibits.  And I have to vent: I don't mind that people take photos in museums, but it drives me crazy when they take the photo and stand there to post it. And stop it with the selfies in museums. It is rude to the rest of the people there. But, back to the museum itself...The building is amazing.  Especially take a good look at the outside, where there are sculptures of all kinds of creatures.  I loved the inside with the huge atrium, and of course the wonderful sculpture of Charles Darwin at the top of the steps. Check out his eyes, they are so lifelike.  There is tons of wonderful things to see in the museum, so enjoy. When you need a pick-me-up, they have a nice cafe for scones, coffee, tea etc.","Crowded, Confusing and Dissapointing"
"February 25, 2015","I had visited the Natural History Museum quite a few years ago when my first child was 10+ and now decided to revisit for the benefit of my second child. Our first experience all those years ago was excellent and we expected the same and perhaps better.Right off the bat, there was a massive queue to even get in. It was drizzling and freezing and we had to wait for over an hour.As we entered, we were shocked with the amount of people we saw (see attached photo). In fact, we could only see people and nothing else. Even the large iconic Diplodocus skeleton in the middle of the grand hall looked tiny and swamped! There seemed to be a massive queue.The exhibits themselves were disappointing with a lot of stuff missing. Entire sections were being refurbished and were off limits.There was general chaos and the lack of proper signs or maps was frustrating. The few staff that we could seek out were not particularly friendly but who can blame them with the sea of people they are having to deal with. There were people sitting on the floor and some seem to be sleeping while others were checking their phones - looking dejected and bored! It looks like a railway station in India or China!I would suggest avoiding this attraction till all the sections are open and the Museum comes up with a better way of organizing the flow of people and the signs etc. I woud suggest they start charging an entry fee so that it would slow the entry of people just wanting to get away from the cold or rain!","Always a great place to visit, young and old alike."
"February 17, 2015","50 years after my dad first took me it never fails to impress. The building itself is a wonder to behold. It was opened in 1881 being an iron structure clad in terra cotta tiles - honey and blue in colour. Sculpted in the tiles are hundreds of animals, both modern and extinct. See how many monkeys you can find climbing the round arches in the main central hall, recently renamed the Hintze Hall after a generous donor.The latest addition to the museum is a stegasaurus called Sophie. It is the only one outside of the USA and the best preserved example of this curious dinosaur. Enter the museum by the Exhibition Road entrance (the old Geological Museum) not only to see Sophie, but also to avoid the long queues at the Cromwell Road front entrance. This is the Red Zone of the museum which is about Roscks and earth processes. Don't miss the earthquake experience at the top floor, reached by a long escalator.The dinosaurs are what children young and old love to see - including the animatronic ones. There are queues to see this, so you can book a time-slot ahead of your visit to save standing around. In the basement is a room where children can get some hands on experience with magnifying glasses and microscopes. Also there is a large picnic area where school parties can eat their sandwiches as well as anyone else wanting to sit and have food brought or bought.The Darwin Centre is a modern building and worth a visit. It is in the shape of a vast cocoon and is the largest building made from spun concrete.Don't miss the Treasures exhibit. This is up the stairs from the main hall and, in a darkened room, are some of the most precious items out of the many millions in this place - including a skeleton of a dodo. Unfortunately the feathered dodo was not to be found in the birds section - it is being refurbished - as is the Lucy ape-creature (not too disappointed as I'm not an evolutionist). And don't wait too long to visit if you want to see Dippy, the diplodocus dinosaur. This has been here since 1905 and will be removed in 2017 to go on tour around the UK.",Top Tips To Beat The Queues In School Holidays
"February 16, 2015","I visited with my two teens during Febuary half term, the first tip I have is to beat the initial queue to get in, go round to the side entrance next to the science museum, this has significantly shorter queues, if you want to be able to walk through the front entrance then do so as you exit to save time ! Once we were in the museum there was a queue of over an hour for the dinosaur exhibit, not many people know this but you can actually pre book a dinosaur gallery visit for free online during school holidays, online booking usually opens about a week before the holidays, you get a booking code and can walk to the front of the queue to the annoyance of everyone in the queue ! The dinosaur gallery is the most popular exhibit in the museum and really is a must for families, following the tips will keep you sane and avoid those ""how long"" questions.",fantastic museum
"February 14, 2015","fantastic museum and worth visiting, especially if you have kids.  Time saving tip…if there is a long line at the Cromwell Street entrance as there was when I went there (massive line winding all the way back to the street from the front door) simply walk around the corner to the Exhibition Street entrance and chances are there is no line at all and you can walk straight in.  Definitely try and avoid school holidays if you can as it is really busy.",For all dinosaur and nature enthusiasts!
"January 24, 2015","I have been going to the NHM for years - as a child, then to take various nieces and nephews and finally with my own children. It was and remains a brilliant day out.  First of all, the outside of the building is beautiful, just look for all the statue creatures around the tops.  Once inside, the dinosaur section is as good as you would want it to be.  After that, we like the natural world section which is opposite. A couple of tips...It gets very busy and it is well worth going at opening time.  If there is a big queue at the front then there is also a side entrance next to the Science Museum. Once inside, make sure that you do the dinosaur part first as that gets busy very quickly and there is often a separate queuing system for that.  The shop is a little expensive but there is a good selection.  The best shop is opposite the insect/bug section.",It's been ages and ages.........So glad to return.
"April 7, 2023","The last time I was here 'Dippy' was on the meet and greet which was some years ago. 'Dippy' has been replaced by 'Hope' the Blue Whale in the the great 'Hintze Hall'. It's a magnificent room with a seated statue of Charles Darwin keeping watch up the first set of stairs. If you get to choose which way you enter the museum choose the front, I took a side entrance in but had to make my way to the Hall before I felt I was really here. It's the heart of the museum and for me one of the most amazing rooms there is, anywhere.'Hope' takes centre stage in the main hall but is suspended from the ceiling so whilst she is amazing in her own right and maybe bigger than 'Dippy' she lacks the eye level, massive dinosaur, impact that 'Dippy' used to have.  'Hope' however is the real deal.If dinosaurs are your thing the there is a separate room for them and a few other dinosaur skeletons doted around the museum. The main dinosaur room is dimly lit and is hugely popular so can get cramped.An animatronics' T-rex is one of the first big dinosaurs you see, but there are other better and real ones to see. T-Rex looks like he shares the same dentist with Jurgen Klopp, the Hollywood teeth on a dinosaur just looks wrong, at least he wasn't wearing sunglasses !Various other rooms featuring a plethora of extinct animals, cats, whales, human evolution, insects and far too much to see in one visit. The most recent exhibit is 'Titanosaur' possibly the Biggestest dinosaur in the world ! It's just gone on display and requires a separate timed ticket so pre-book before you get there. There is a fee to see this exhibition but it has just gone on display so was extremely popular. I failed to get a ticket the night before so will have to visit again soon but no matter there really is so much to see on multiple levels, just make sure you get a map and as a tip start in the main hall, it has a Wow factor all of it's own.The only downside is, as with any free to enter museum, there's just too many people and they have a captive market for food and drink.",Magic Memories website
"January 23, 2023",Still no photographs received after paying online to Magic Memories.com over a month ago. Unable to get refund.  Be warned.,Too hot to enjoy.
"August 23, 2022",Great museum with an amazing array of things to see and do but it was UNBEARABLY hot and the feeble warnings here and there were not representative of how hot it actually is. We couldn’t wait to leave.,FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE
"July 10, 2022","I spent almost 4 hours in the museum and loved the many displays from Dinosaurs, Mammels, Birds, Darwin and more. I believe this museum to be the best in the world, certainly the displays are done at a top notch level for both adults and children",Great historical visit
"May 19, 2022",You can spend hrs here - there is so much to see and read and it's brilliant for kids of all ages. The building is stunning too.,take the kids
"March 28, 2022","went primarily for the wildlife photography exhibition, but struggled with the museum, its very disjointed, and very crowded, an may be its more geared to a younger audience, though i found the marine and mammal section interesting, but both under served.",Natural History is Awesome
"February 6, 2022","Lots to see and an interesting mix of displays. From saving the planet, dinosaurs and lots, lots more, you could ask for a better setting. The building is stunning.",Great architecture - but too many kids!!!!!!
"January 26, 2022","***disabled reviewer***I have to say, I didn't enjoy this museum as much as I thought I might.  Mainly because I'm a childless adult.  there are a LOT of kids here, and fair enough.  it's just very noisy and very difficult to get near anything as the kids sort of, dare I say it, get in the way! eek! The exhibits were wonderful, but I'd steer clear of the dinosaurs bit, it was so crowded and not that great tbh because they were mainly 'replicas' or animatronics.  Not the real deal.The great hallway is magnificent, even without Dippy.  I particularly loved the architecture.  Look around at the walls when you go - you'll see some wonderful things.We ate at the T-Rex diner - it was busy (1pm ish!) but we were seated at a table with a number on, you go up and order, and they bought the food within about 5-10 mins! The drinks took longer - but hey, it's busy.  We had a New-Yorker sandwich, made fresh to order, with large chunky, fresh bread, and plenty of fries.  The table had a bottle of water and two thimble glasses.  Our drinks order was also tiny, but for the price (around £15) it was good value. The pizzas looked great too - freshly made, with charred bits and plenty big enough for dinner, not alone lunch for one!  I was also able to charge my scooter here.The staff here are friendly and helpful. I wish they'd offer a kid-free time to visit.  By the time I left, I had tinnitus from all the noise that kids make. We were here for 5 hours or so.  (I'm not totally anti-children, it's just hard navigating around them in a wheelchair)",Terrifying
"January 1, 2022","We visited the ice rink on New Year’s Eve and really wish we hadn’t! Would suggest because of the mild weather the ice was melting and there was two inches of standing water on the rink, it was too dangerous. I was knocked over backwards by a tall bloke who’d been weaving in and out precariously of other skaters throughout the session. I hit my head and momentarily blacked out. My 12 year old daughter had to call over staff, one of whom said it wasn’t his job to help. When I was finally helped off the ice was seen by a grumpy first aider who seemed more intent on telling off my traumatised daughter for wanting to be with me than in carrying out a proper check over. She checked me for concussion, made me sign a piece of paper and gave me some paracetamol and sent me on my way, totally missing the bleeding gash on the back of my head despite me telling her my head hurt. Poor organisation, poorly trained staff, who all seemed too young to deal with a crisis and poor management to keep the rink open when others had closed because of the weather. Thankfully I was just a walking wounded but dread to think how they would have reacted to a serious injury!",Great dinosaur area
"August 27, 2021","The building in itself is worth the visit and great dinosaur display; the other displays are average, bur nice. The free tickets are impossible to get at short notice, but you can buy a membership that entitles to entry without booking for one year.",Spend hours

"March 9, 2020",This place is massive! I managed to miss all the maps when I walked in so I got a bit lost and overwhelmed by the sheer size of the place! Many interesting and well curated exhibits that you could spend the whole day getting lost in. Lots of the exhibits are directed towards children but they are still fun for adults too!,Interesting visit
"March 8, 2020","We had to wait awhile in the queue whilst raining, but once we got in, we stopped off at the café which the food was worth the price, we got the lasagne came with two sides and the server gave a good portion.The exhibits themselves were very interesting and interactive which added more to the interest!",Fantastic and educational

"March 5, 2020",Well worth a visit. Brilliant display of photos award winning photos. The Member's bar an oasis and escape from the Saturday crowd.,This museum was absolutely amazing.
"March 3, 2020","This was one of the highlights of our trip.  We could have spent all day here if not several days.  Apparently, this is one of Prince Charles' favorite buildings.

"January 30, 2020",If you are in the museum you should visit the exhibition „Wildlife photographer of the year“. The exhibits (wildlife photos) are stunning and quite interesting. It is really worth its money. ,Educational visit
"January 30, 2020",We went as a family with a 3 year old and she loved it. Free entry still which is amazing in the centre of London. Some of the older rooms maybe could do with an update but a brilliant museum  ,Entertaining and interesting
"January 28, 2020",It’s a really good place to spend a morning. Alone or with family and kids it’s perfect and approaches all kind of public. I’d say it’s and essential place to go when visiting London.,Great Museum
"January 27, 2020",You can easily spend the whole day but we had 2 hours ans had to choose between the exhibitions. The building is amazing and the dinasours and whales are one of a kind. The minerals section was also very interesting.,Stunning building
"January 26, 2020",it's worth visiting just to see the architecture of the museum. it's simply breath taking. There are some nice exhibits inside..well worth a visit,Impressive collection
"January 21, 2020","First of all, it is a stunning building. And the exhibitions are huge. Dinosaur section was very well presented, even though we have visited other museums with more impressive collections (e.g. Berlin) but all in all it was a very nice experience.",A lot of useful knowledge on place

"January 18, 2020",Definitely an amazing museum for adults and children (although I admit the focus is children) so you can spend quite a time inside learning new things. ,Christmas treat to London
"January 16, 2020",My husband suprised me with a trip to London and our first stop on arrival was the natural history museum. A truly awesome place cannot believe it's free but well deserving of your donations!! You'll spend a good few hours in ther wondering round is a maze of things to see.,Best of London
"December 29, 2019","Went here with the family, my 4 year old was all about the dinosaurs, and that was the main reason we went. Fantastic excebition, specially the dinosaurs and the  whales was our favourites. Lunchtime at T-Grill, laim hamburger and crappy service- please choose one of the other kafeterias. VERY nice shops, both Dino-shop and the ordinary shop. Lots of people- even on a weekday in November. ",Wonderful!
"December 29, 2019",We took our 21 month old son to see the dinosaurs for the first time and he was in awe! It was busy (Saturday between Christmas and New Year) but we expected that. If you can go on a weekday during term time you're laughing! Also - go the 'Moon' while it's there...great as a chill out!Paying a £5 donation is nothing compared to the amount you can see in this awesome museum! ,Wonderful architecture and exhibits
"December 26, 2019",We see something different every time we visit. The building itself is a spectacle and the exhibits fascinating. Educational and thrilling. Fabulous place,Unmissable. 
"December 26, 2019","This, along with the Science Museum, is the jewel in the crown of London museums. My wife and I have spent many a happy day here with my young son, who has soaked up its many educational facets.",Blast from the past
"December 26, 2019",Kids loved the Natural History Museum as always! Very educational and entertaining. Loved the Minerals & the Vault! ,Beautiful place.
"December 24, 2019",This place is really beautiful. If you love seeing history before your eyes. This is the perfect place. ,To crowded to enjoy. Terrible experience. Much better things to do in London.
"December 23, 2019",Have to say I doubt anyone could enjoy this museum with  the number of people packed in. I certainly did not. We lasted 15 mins and left it was terrible.  It was so crowded that you could not move or read anything. Too many people which honestly should be controlled with timed tickets or maybe charging people. I know that is a terrible thing to say in this country but look at Europe most of the museums cost something to go into.,London Museums are Amazing- Free entry to this place
"December 23, 2019","You need lot of time to explore London attractions, but if get few days then don't miss out museums specifically those where you get free entry. If you love historical things and want to explore natural things, do visit this place. Wheel chair access and lifts are available. ",Wow
"December 22, 2019","What an amazing and beautiful building even before you get inside! So much to see you could spend all day here. Free to get in, they do ask for a donation. Places to eat too. ",Wildlife Photographer of the Year
"December 22, 2019",Our annual pilgrimage to this superb exhibition and it did not disappoint.Superb range of stunningly beautiful and captivating images.This year’s standard is so much superior than last years.Did not agree with overall winner but that’s a subjective opinion.Loved it,Excellent! Queuing are fast
"January 4, 2020","A bit crowded, I came there at around noon. But the queues were very fast, so don't be discarded by a big line in front of the entrance.",Fantastic museum!
"January 3, 2020","This museum is huge! Even before you enter, this is an impressive place. The building is really impressive and beautiful. If you like museums of this type, this is a must. Recommended.",Very busy during holidays
"January 2, 2020","Crowds are well controlled and displays very interesting.No tickets, but donations requested. Cafe has acceptable food.",Amazign and worth the visit!
"January 2, 2020","For any natural science enthusiast this is a dream come true! Every single exhibition was stunning and they even had a wild life photographer as a guest speaker on the day we were there. Loads of reading and hands on, but can get quite draining due to information overload and the walking. ","National History Museum, Better than ever, more exibits, 6 Stars."
"January 2, 2020","We went to the Museum on 1st January 2020, you have to get there early almost as they open to beat the rush, the exhibits now are mind blowing, they have a Dinosaur section with a range of Dinosaurs of different types, they have a Large Tyrannosaurus that moves roars and looks really authentic, then opposite they a huge moon in a darkened room, we spent some time looking at it, it was amazing, they have a large area with machines that help you understand different human evolution, Language, eyesight, just about everything, you can spend all day in this Museum and you will come back again. Restaurants Cafes, plenty of seating, if you are in London this a must, we will be going again.",Awesome in every way!
"December 31, 2019","Amy young grandson loves his dinosaurs! So I’m our trip to London from California, I knew we had to make a stop at this gorgeous museum.  We are visiting during the busy week after Christmas and the decorations are everywhere including the museum grounds. We knew we couldn’t commit to more than a couple of hours with a toddler and infant in tow so decided to get there around 3 (it closes at 550). The line to get in seemed daunting but actually moved very quickly.  The building itself is an architectural beauty and even those who are usually turned in by interesting buildings have to be awestruck by its grandeur outside and in - don’t forget to look up at the amazing ceilings as you walk around.  The exhibits for the dinosaurs have something for everyone and is truly a remarkable collection. But probably let the most memorable moment was my 3 year old grandson coming up close and personal with a full size audio animatronic TRex! That was something and almost enough to jolt him out of his jet lag. We stopped in the cafe for coffee and scones and weren’t disappointed Outside for the holidays there was an ice skating rink and carousel.  A really great afternoon and only wish we had more time there....without the little ones and a double wide stroller in tow!",Favourite exhibits
"December 30, 2019","Overall this is a fantastic museum containing every kind of natural exhibit you could think of, thoughtfully laid out and we'll documented. Oh and did I mention? It's free.Standout feature for me was the ""moon room"" with an enormous suspended globe covered in photo montages of the moon. You can just sit or lie on the floor and stare at it for ages. Mesmerizing.Also take the ride up the escalator into the big glowing planet in the geological section.",Choose your times wisely...
"December 30, 2019","We went on a Saturday morning, there was about 20 mins que time so not so bad. We came out mid afternoon to find people queuing all the way to the main road with staff announcing that both entries had a que time of 1hr plus to get entry to the museum. I'm glad we went early!!!It's a fab museum and other reviews can explain what there is to do ( a highlight for us was the Kobe supermarket earthquake room ) but the main thing we noticed was that this place gets absolutely PACKED. Maybe if there was some sort of crowd control system it'd be easier to spend more time at the exhibits? It's quite easy to find yourself being carried along with the crowds. The downstairs picnic area though is incredible, loads of space and was very quite especially compared to the restaurant area which was near full capacity by 12pm.That said, once you're in you can easily spend an enjoyable full day here!",A very brief visit
"December 29, 2019",I popped into the Natural History Museum with a friend and immediately regretted our lack of time! The exhibits we were able to visit briefly were very impressive and informative. I would love to return. There can be huge queues so I'd advise arriving quite early or leaving it a little later to avoid queuing. ,Great museum - too crowded
"December 29, 2019","There are so many great exhibits at this museum, but you constantly must fight the crowd.  They should charge for admission to reduce the crowds or even create an appointment system.  If I were to just rate the exhibits, it would easily be five stars ",Excellent
"November 25, 2019","These museums are always overwhelming. The dinosaur exhibit is really nice. The animatronic t-rex is really cool. It was very busy, so hard to get around. A free museum, though--you can't complain. The moon exhibition was also really cool and the evolution area always interests me too.",An interesting place to visit for every one.
"November 25, 2019","We visited this place on a Saturday afternoon.  There was a bit of  queue but we didn't have long to wait.  We went first to the Dinosaur section and the first thing you see on the entrance hall is a dinosaur hanging from the ceiling.  They have a couple of working models.  The only thing I wasn't too happy about was having to follow a line via a cordoned off sectipn, but I suppose it stops any  chaos.  There were a lot of families there and most of the children found it exciting.  We also had a look at the room of the moon, which was quite interesting and the bird section and saw Guy.the Gorilla who had died in the late 1970's.  Well worth a visit.on a rainy afernoon. ",Best gift shop for kids!
"November 24, 2019",It is a wonderful Museum that could take days to cover completely. It has several gift shops that have great gifts for kids. Gorgeous building too!,AMAZING........
"November 23, 2019","You don't get much for free in this world, but OMG !!!! If only to look at the building you must go. What a place. There is something to look at from every angle. As for the content.... there is more than enough for you to while away a good 3-4 hours. The exhibitions are amazing and it's good to see that there is always something else in nature that will blow you away. A souvenir brochure was only a fiver and full of glossy pictures. Entry is free and there is opportunity to donate , £5 is recommended and is well worth it. ",One of my favorite musea ever!
"November 23, 2019","This museum is cool, not just for kids but everyone. The collection is HUGE and very impressive. The animals, dinosaurs, mammals, stones, minerals and so much more! It's a very nice way to learn about planet earth and it's animals, what roamed our planet millions of years ago. The only thing that could be better was the mammal part, it felt a bit outdated compared to the rest of the museum. The building itself is absolutely stunishing, beautiful architecture and the ceiling is just WOW! You can easily spend an entire day here if you would like, but also pick different sections of your choice. Like the title said: One of my favorite musea in the world. You must go see this!PS. The Museum of the Moon is REALLY nice!",Fantastic in every way
"November 21, 2019",Take all the family. There isn't enough time in the day to see it all and so kid friendly. Not to be missed.,Simply amazing
"November 20, 2019","It would take to long to write a review on this wonderful place. We spent over four hours looking through history and enjoyed every minute, I would however recommend wearing good comfy shoes.",Take the time to read about the history of this place.
"November 18, 2019","My daughter and I wandered in and spent hours here. The architecture and the history behind it is enough to enchant you and then there are all the displays, the uncovered bones and history behind them, the dinosaurs and exhibits of all sorts of animals. I liked that there was a note on one exhibit that was admittedly looking a little frayed by the many years but that these animals would not be replaced because they no longer believe in killing and mounting the body for display. I really appreciated that so much and found that to be an honorable note to this beautiful museum. Look for the carvings every where of monkeys and birds and other animals in the staircases and beams. There is a Moon display lit up and people were laying on the floor beneath it. It truly was so gorgeous. My daughter and I absolutely loved wandering thru here. ",Really impressed
"November 18, 2019","Took the kids here on a Saturday and they loved it, there is so much to see, you really need 3-4 hours to get around it all.Gets quite busy but wasn't horrendously so.Making a donation is made easy by card or cash when you go in.",Lots and lots to see
"November 18, 2019","This museum offers way more than one can see in a day, maybe even a week. The building is beautiful and the collection enormous and very old. Definitely go here if you're visiting London. One downside, it's usually extremely packed with children. ",Wild life exhibit 
"November 17, 2019",I have been here for this exhibit the last couple of years. It is truly amazing to walk through so much history and then go for the wild life exhibit. I can recommend this place.,Marvellous day out.
"November 17, 2019",Sooooo much to see and do all under one roof. We spent the whole day in there and didn’t see everything. Leave plenty of time  to visit. ,"Wonderful place to explore and learn, but expect crowds"
"November 17, 2019","Loved the museum, but as with such a large facility, some areas were closed off that I would have loved to explore a bit. A wonderful docent was stationed to help teach more about items that would have been found in one of the areas closed for renovation, which was wonderful. It was both enjoyable and a bit overwhelming how many students where there for fieldtrips, but we anticipated this, given it was mid-week - so if you go, make sure to anticipate that! The credit card system went down about five minutes before we checked out with our items at the gift shop which, clearly wasn't their issue, but just wanted to forewarn others that it may be an intermittent issue as I had read about it happening previously in another review somewhere. All in all, staff were stellar, welcoming and friendly and we enjoyed our self-paced visit. ",Enter into the center of the earth
"November 17, 2019","The escalator takes you into the belly of the earth , thats your entry inrto Natural History which is a wonderful museum well worth the visit. Some galleries have been updated and a few look dated but watching the kids go through was very cool as they were totally taken but low tech and high tech displays . A must visit",Wow
"November 15, 2019",This was my first visit to the London History Museum and I wasn't disappointed.Lots to see and do and educational for children too.The added bonus was admission was free.A must see if visiting London.,Speechless
"November 13, 2019","The building itself, is utterly beautiful, magnificently so. We were moved to tears ( quite literally ) by the sheer beauty of the place.Then on top of that you get the exhibitions! All together a fantastic visit, and it's free, although we gave £10 each. Unparalleled value!",A great flying whale over you
"November 12, 2019",Or at least the skeleton... it’s an impressive collection of natural wonders that varies from the dinosaurs to the moon.Maybe you need a couple of days to really visit all what is there. ,Solo adult visit
"November 11, 2019","Remember going as a youngster, and when my children were younger want to see what it was like now.Wirth notting  if you want a map you need to pay. There are however maps on the wall and posts through out the museum.Dinosaurs, mamamal, whales and dolphins were good. There is pleanty of interaction opportunity even as an adult in the whales and dolphins.  Seeing the Blue Whale(in the enterance hall) and The Museum of the Moon when it gad gone dark was amazing and well worth that photo.",Excellent content. Very overcrowded 
"November 10, 2019","The museum is has its good and bad pointsThe good.- The quality and diversity of content is outstanding. There is a huge variety of exhibits. Others have commented on this. - A fantastic dinosaur section. Great for younger kids esp. the moving T-Rex. However the route through this section has been changed and, I guess due to the crowds, the elevated walkway has been closed. Most are are hung from the ceiling and so are best viewed from above on the elevated walkway rather than from below as now.- very good physical earth section. Very good descriptions about the exhibit (volcanoes, earthquakes etc)- A wonderful buildingThe not so good- The museum is tired and run down. Some displays are dated, many are dirty and the accompanying visuals and explanations are poor and low level in most places. The NY museum is far far better in this respect and shows how it should be done. The bad- The museum is very overcrowded. One can’t enjoy at weekends. This is because it is free. So it is overrun, noisy, chaotic in many parts, run down and obviously lacks investment and so is deteriorating.- Why does the UK permit this? Why not allow those of its citizens on social security to go in for free and charge everyone else, like every other museum of its class in other countries. That way the UK would stop subsidising tourists like me and the museum would have more money to spend on its upkeep and invest in its future. Overall it’s a lovely museum but avoid at the weekend. ",Afternoon trip the the National History Museum
"November 7, 2019","I visited here with my 13 year old daughter. We were taken with the blue whale bones, Andy's clock and the the natural world area. We had coffee and hot chocolate which were nice in the central cafe. The surroundings and the building are beautiful. There is so much to see. We'd definitely love to go back some day.",Museum
"December 9, 2019","We visited here and had a lovely time, very bright and airy and the displays were very good. The museum was clean and tidy and had an enjoyable experience.",Amazing.
"December 8, 2019","Amazing museum.  So rich in species diversity, from mammals to cnidaria, it has incredible fossils and is extremely important for knowledge and our history.  The human body part is also wonderful and interactive.  The museum also has several cafes and options for breaks and rest.","Way too crowded, many things not on display"
"December 3, 2019","This museum is free, which is fantastic, but you have to pay extra to see things like their  giant squid specimen (which I had been looking forward to). The dino and mammal skeletons are spectacular, but hard to appreciate because the museum was completely packed on a Friday morning. Loads and loads of school trips and tiny babies who should not have been out.",Excellent
"December 2, 2019","I still cannot believe this museum is free of charge.  Our four children ages 4 to 16 loved this museum.  We were impressed with everything it had to offer.  It was perfect day for it as well since it was raining that day, and we were nice and dry inside the museum.",Visit to Natural History Museum
"December 1, 2019",Beautiful architecture both inside and out Colour of stonework very complimentary to the surroundingsInteresting exhibits - we visited for the Wildlife Photographer of the year Some parts of the museum were a little overcrowded - our visit was on a Thursday and as expected some schools were also visiting,Thumbs up for this!
"November 26, 2019",Really enjoyed myself at this museum. Free entry (as usual for museums in London). So many things to see. Especially the whale skeleton(most instagrammable photo op) i guess. Very interesting gift shop. Its near Science Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum too. Walking distance of Harrods too.,Such friendly staff!
"November 26, 2019",We were here again for the Wildlife Photographer exhibition and loved it as much as in previous years. We were late for our slot but staff was very wellcoming.,A little child's dream come true
"November 26, 2019","I wish I'd been here earlier, when I was 10 years old and was delirious with dinosaurs and other fossils :)",Very impressive museum 
"November 25, 2019",This was my third visit to the museum and it was as thrilling as the first time. It covers many topics ranging from earthquakes to dinosaurs. It is suitable for all ages and there's a big emphasis on visualization of the exhibits. Highly recommend! ,Best Day Ever
"November 25, 2019","I had the best Day ever at Natural History Museum. The building was in itself amazing. They had activity books for children, so it's well suited to bring kids (maybe not the youngest ones <4 y/o).I was crying inside of joy the whole time because it was all so great. Dinasours, mammals, gems, minerals, sea shells, creepy creatures, and so on. I had hoped the Human Evolution area had more models of extinct homos/humans tho. We didn't get to see everything on one day, so we will definetely go back!",Wonderful museum!!
"November 6, 2019", We happened to be staying a few blocks from the museum & everyone recommended it so we had to visit. It did not disappoint! My daughter loved the fossil exhibits & dinosaur exhibits. The moon simply was beautiful & fascinating to me. My husband loved the animals & watching our daughter take pix of her fav things. There were loads of school groups there but we never felt over - crowded. What a treasure of a museum to have in London!,History
"November 6, 2019",I really enjoyed the Natural History Museum. But I enjoyed most of all the gems and rocks. Hundreds of different types.,Crowds of people
"November 6, 2019",We stood in line for about 45mins and the queue was about 150 metres long. So many people were packed inside it was almost impossible to see any of the exhibits. As soon as you stopped to look you got jostled or someone went in front of you. We gave up and left,"Amazing place to visit, you can easily spend a full day here!"
"November 6, 2019","It is a great place to visit, especially if you have young children. It is great that it is a free museum ( there are some exhibitions which you will need to pay to enter). Section for dinosaurs is brilliant, especially if you have young children!. There is so much to see which you can easily spend the whole day. Also the building itself is very old and historical, don't miss it.",Worth the visit
"November 5, 2019","Excellent exhibits, educational and interesting enough for one to get all caught up in reading and wanting to learn more about what they are seeing in front of them. It gets crowded but there will be moments when you can enjoy your viewing without a whole bunch of people crowding in front of you.",Love it
"November 5, 2019",Great place for small as adults you can be there half day and enjoy trip no fees and is much more better than scien museum i think was very boring we both love IT  tirex is great,Mighty dinsaurs
"November 5, 2019",Amazing place. Really reveals the wonder of nature especially of times past. Allow plenty of time to just look and absorb what is on display form the absolute tiny to the unbelievably enormous. Well worth a visit at any time. A fantastic way to spend a day. ,Wildlife Photo Contest
"November 5, 2019","The Natural History Museum has a wonderful collection of all the things you would expect. It also has the Wildlfe Photography contest for 2019. This is the exhibit is 100of the top and class winning pictures that garnered awards. These photos are just stunning and each picture has a brief history of how, what, why and where it was taken. The exhibit runs to May of 2020 and advance purchase tickets are recommended by the staff.",The Best Natural History Museum in the UK!
"November 3, 2019","All schoolchildren in London go to this museum at least once - but it is better if they can go more than that. There is so much to see. It is worth knowing that the old Geological Museum entrance on Exhibition Road is easier to access (smaller queues) than the main entrance on Cromwell Road. When you go in, check out the minerals in the wall before going up the escalator to the earthquake machine. The old geological displays are worth viewing before getting into the biological exhibits.We took a junior school boy and girl from India and I was surprised that both enjoyed it much more than the Science Museum next door. There is so much to see in both - they are not to be missed!",Best museum in the UK by far 
"November 2, 2019","Been coming her since w child and this place never fails to entertain kids and adults alike, beautiful architecture too!",A unique day!!!
"October 31, 2019",Very impressive museum with fascinating exhibits. It was worth it visiting. Excellent for children and adults too.,Amazing 
"October 31, 2019","Won't say too much apart from loads to do, beautiful building, could spend hours there, kids and adults! Loved it.  Easy to get to and so much to see.Highly recommended ","An enormous, well organized, set of 5 collections!"
"October 30, 2019","This world famous ""Natural History"" Museum, highlights ""scientific excellence"", and was established 138 years ago.  It has a collection of about 80 million items, that are divided into 5 different themes/collections-- which will appeal to visitors of all ages.  The Museum (located near 2 other remarkable museums) can be readily reached by public transport (& admission is free).  The Museum has been awarded TripAdvisor's ""Certificate of Excellence"" [based on feedback from travellers like us].  The extensive collection, covering a huge area, is organized into 29 ""galleries"", which are then grouped into 4 main areas (each is ""colour coded"")... so, it would be advisable to think about one's priorities and then, at the information desk, ask where they are located.  In addition to a great gift shop, there are 5 restaurants/cafes--- one of which, T.Rex, is ""Dinosaur themed"".  A visit will be most memorable.I hope that this Review has been helpful.",Full of fascinating things
"October 30, 2019",Interesting exhibits in a beautiful building. Definitely worth a visit - you can spend several hours in here. I was particularly pleasantly surprised by the geology exhibits.,Vienna Nat Hist Museum is FAR better!
"October 30, 2019","Anyone who has been to Vienna Natural History Museum would NOT be amazed by this museum. The entry hall seems rather poor and climbing up and down on the stairs did not make us happy. The vault with gems is amazing though, as well as 4,5 billion y old meteorite!Since my last visit the museum has been upgraded, I liked the apps, teaching kids, bringing them closer to nature!",Hungary
"November 3, 2019","Intresting exhibition we enjoyed it. Long quey at the entrance as it is free,but you can get in within short time. If you have time do not skip it.",Really interesting

"October 27, 2019","Visited this museum on a Saturday in school holiday time, although it was busy you can still get to see all the exhibits. Exhibits are brilliant well set out and world class.

"October 26, 2019","This place is amazing and has been on my bucket list for a while now. As I was in London I couldn’t give this a miss, nor could thousands of others. The museum is split into four main sections and you would probably need a day in each section to do it justice. I had just four hours so was basically walking through the areas taking note of major exhibits. At the end of my brief visit I left thinking that I need to return at some time in the future. Highly recommended. ",Brilliant half term day out
"October 24, 2019","Went to London for the day 23rd Oct 2019, with my 6yr old grandson,  the exhibits  are amazing  the blue whale  t rex,  the earthquake  simulator was good, we spent almost 5 hrs there, it was quite busy, but that's because  it's half term, I would recommend  it to anybody,  adults and children,  lots to see and do,  , highly recommended",Everyone wants To be here in August. I think I’d prefer to come in winter
"October 24, 2019",Every child loves to come here. Lots of us big kids too! The queues are long waiting to come in. It’s located next to the Victoria and Albert so you may be able to combine them and make it a big day. ,Outstanding- for the Darwinian collection alone!
"October 23, 2019",There is so much to see and do here and so much to learn. The natural History Museum was close to the Holiday Inn Hotel  where I was staying so I had a leisurely walk and then proceeded to spend the bulk of the day at the Museum soaking up knowledge.,Impressive insight into the natural world
"October 22, 2019","Our main goal was to look at the Wildlife Photographer of the Year. The exhibition was great and educational. In addition, we enjoyed the impressive building. Exposure to dinosaurs is in high demand, not to be silent there. I recommend that you enjoy the atmosphere of the 2nd floor.","Brilliant displays, lots to see and touch"
"October 22, 2019",My 6 year old and I loved the NHM. The displays are awesome and there is lots to enjoy. You can spend quite a few hours here. The only downside was the cafe which I thought was overpriced for the offering they had and also virtually impossible to get a seat. It still didn't detract from our overall enjoyment.We went in early November and enjoyed the Ice rink which is part of the NHM grounds. It was beautifully set up with a magical xmas tree and lovely cafe with a great cup of hot chocolate to warm you up after the ice skating. Top marks.,"Great museum in general, just lacking new content "
"October 20, 2019","I still love this museum considering that I already visited it before back in 2016..however, there isn't much new in terms of new exhibits (compared to Tate Modern for example or Science Museum), so i ended up walking through it relatively quickly this time. Overall I think it's magic is most definitely present for anyone seeing this museum for the first time, however I'd recommend you go elsewhere if you've already been to this museum in the last few years. ",Well worth it!
"October 20, 2019","So much to see, you could be here a day and still not take it all in. Found it easy to browse through and experience lots of 'hands-on' exhibits. This place is so big, yet it handles crowds well. ",Amazing
"October 19, 2019",In a few words: It’s simply amazing.You can spend hours in this museum and it will still surprise you in every new room.,Α must see in London
"October 18, 2019","An absolute must see for families. Very well organized, family friendly and in a impressive building. Tip: try to visit it during the week and if possible be there around 9:40 to avoid the big quews. It opens daily at 10:00.",Family outing
"October 17, 2019","This museum is interesting, really entertaining, but it would be way more interesting with little children (I think?): The stories and the interactiveness would attract them more than adults :) ",What a building - go just for that!
"October 17, 2019",Try to go at least once a year usually to a specific exhibition. This year was wildlife photography.  Just love the building.  Probably one of my favourite museums ahead of Musee D'Orsee in Paris. ,Family time
"October 16, 2019","The place is perfect to visit with children, plenty objects on display. We recommend the place to families",The best museum in london!

"October 15, 2019","They have some fantastic things in the collections, but the displays are really tired and unimaginative - straight from the 70's - and in desperate need of updating. A must visit I guess, but don't expect any inspired presentation...oh, it will be busy too of course...",Historic day out
"October 14, 2019",Absolutely great day out. You can't fault it. Loads to see. It's absolutely free and entertaining. I would suggest anyone to visit.,Amazing building

"October 14, 2019"," A must visit on your visit to London.  No fee to enter,only donations are welcomed.  Museum had replicas of dinosaurs, whales, and other mammals, human history,  earth beginning....The Moon sculpture is breathtaking and remembering. ",Dinosaurs and a Bluewhale!
"October 14, 2019","The title says it all, but there is more to it.During weekends and Holidays there are hour long cues outside (in the rain).I don't think it is worth the wait.But when you can go there during the week before noon, you won't have to wait and can enjoy the exhibition.It's free of admission, but of course a donation is a nice thing.There are several Restaurants and Shops in there.",Moon exhibit totally cool.  Easy to navigate
"October 14, 2019","Definitely a must on your next visit to London.  No fee to enter but donations are definitely welcomed.  Museum replicas of dinosaurs, whales, and other mammals - totally cool.  The Moon sculpture exhibit was breathtaking.  ",amazing building full of wonders
"October 14, 2019","We visited late on a Friday afternoon when it wasn't too busy. This allowed for a more pleasant experience exploring the exhibits and taking in the historical information. The new wonders section is amazing, full of great items with a very good interactive learning  experience. The cafe was also pretty good, serving good coffee and a decent selection of food. Don't forget the science museum next door, it's equally as impressive",A great day to spend with the family
"October 14, 2019",Great place to take young children to explore and wonder. Selfishly it is a place for adults to learn and get lost in learning. Highly recommend it!!,Interesting.
"October 14, 2019",Very special place and the work behind gathering this museum must be a lifetime work of many people. Thank you for making this so special.,Fantastic way to spend a sunday afternoon 
"October 13, 2019","A place full if culture and culture Free entry Lots if eating and snacking places, a little but expensive but worth the treat. Member cN try the Annerly ROom for a quiet meal or snack ",Exceptional
"September 22, 2019","What a building, what a place! So much to see and do. Our 6yr old daughter absolutely loved seeing all the various exhibits, particularly the birds, creepy crawlies and of course, the awesome dinosaurs, as did we. A must see place. You could spend hours here. Plenty of places to eat as well. Thoroughly recommended!",Just amazing
"September 22, 2019","Unbelievable. Kids loved it, so much to see, need to go again as didn't have time to absorb everything. Kids were thoroughly engrossed in everything and loved the dinosaur! Can't wait to return (may go without the kids next time ha ha!).",Exciting and eerie at the same time.
"September 21, 2019","When you first enter you will be in ore of the size of some of the subjects, but at the same time you are completely captured with the tour information, it’s gripping.",Mad in the school holidays 
"September 20, 2019",Absolutely rammed on a sunny August day so I cannot imagine what it would be like on a rainy day! Lots to see but slightly ruined by the crowds. Can recommend the picnic area in the basement as it was much quieter than anywhere else and had a little coffee shop too!,Wowowowowowow
"September 19, 2019",A great way to spend a few hours as we did on the last day in London before we went to the airport.  Stunning building and excellent interactive and well presented displays. Easy to get to as the South Kensington Tube Station is very close by,I was expecting way more than what i saw
"September 19, 2019",Its was ok ! Not more than that. There are some exhibition and the entrance is free. I think this museum is more for kids.,Disappointing
"September 18, 2019", Very difficult to navigate around and the so missed areas. Lady in the cafe was so sullen made us feel we were disturbing her just to get served. ,Enough for a whole day!
"September 17, 2019","If you’re planning to visit, I have two tips;1. Make sure you have a whole day free for it! There’s a lot there!2. Don’t go during the school holidays! Me and my girlfriend made that mistake in August! Absolutely heaving! Couldn’t even get round a tiny section without clipping the heals of toddlers and being run over by careless chavvy mums with pushchairs. Probably best if you don’t take much stuff with you because it you want to put it in the cloakroom I’d suggest you take out a mortgage for doing so. Same if you want to use the café. There’s so much to see, and so much to read that you simply can’t take it all in. From rare crystals to dinosaurs (and no I’m not still talking about the clientele!). So much interactivity to enjoy, not just for kids - I learnt so much in the optical illusion section about how your brain sees things for example. So much to see and do and incredible architecture!","A feast for the soul, both young and old"
"September 16, 2019","I haven't been here since I was about the age of my son I was taking (9). I could, in all honesty, remember very little about the place.First impression was the magnificence of the building on approach which is simply stunning. Then, that magical first moment of walking in and seeing the suspended giant skeleton and seeing my son's face. From then on, it was just a magical tour of all things fascinating, with fabulous variation of activities, interactive bits, films and so much more.The Moon exhibit, despite its simplicity, is utterly enchanting.We spent a few hours here in the midst of a busy day's action and could easily have spent much longer.The fact that this spectacular museum, which is better than just about any museum you can name, is free just makes me love the place even more.An essential visit for families.",Well it was a bit dull really and the man on the door was abusive asking for money!
"September 14, 2019",We took some Filipino friends to the natural hisrory meseum but the displays were mostly out of the 1950's and certainly not attuned to an international audience. I felt the man on the door was abusive askign for money in the way he did to what should be a free experience which was frankly shameful. I will not take people there again from abroad.,Mesmerize visit
"September 4, 2019","One word, Amazing, although I was on a weekend, the amount of people didn't interrupt at all the wonderful visit. Very interesting exhibitions organized in a very clear and easy way to find your way ",Great time 
"September 4, 2019",I visited with my wife and two kids (five and nine) they had a  great time and so did we. It was busy but not too busy. My son really loved the Lego build an alien part which was a free add on ,Very informative 
"September 4, 2019",Great place beautiful building jam packed with information old and new. Something of interest for everyone. Staff are very knowledgeable and helpful. Can't believe there's no admission fee although there are donation boxes which i did contribute too.Great day out its a must place to visit.,Enormous and full of amazing stuff 
"September 3, 2019","Incredible building,  amazing architecture and so full of incredible specimens.  It was very crowded the day we were there with many schools doing end of year trips, so that was a bit challenging at times but couldn't be helped.   Our only issue was the lack of air circulation,   everything was very stuffy so we found ourselves needing to head outside regularly for some fresh air. Would definitely recommend if museums and animals are your thing.",Absolutely brilliant
"September 2, 2019","I can't recommend the natural history museum enough. I took the children during the school summer holidays. It was busy but not overcrowded, we didn't have to queue to get in. There is just so much to see here, we could easily have spent an entire day walking around. The museum itself is immaculate and everything is in great working order, far better than the nearby science museum. I don't think I've ever been to a museum with so many artifacts and so much information about each subject. I would urge people to consider donating to the museum, if they are able to, there are plenty of contactless machines and donation spots. This sort of museum must cost a fortune to run and we're so lucky to be able to visit for free.",Wonderful educational museum
"September 1, 2019","This is a fabulous museum, with incredible displays and interactive opportunities.   Great for all ages.  Only problem is the crowds, at least on the day we visited. (Saturday in August)  One should try for a quieter time.  Old great museum that has been updated.  Well worth the visit.",Best attraction in London
"August 31, 2019",Very interesting and worth it! Great for kids and adults...it is also right next to science museum. That is day out in London right there. ,Surely one of the world's greatest museums
"August 31, 2019","Even if you have no interest in natural history you should at least go and see the building, it's absolutely stunning with, seemingly, every column and block individually designed. My 10 year old daughter adores the place and insists we go every time we come to London to, as a minimum, see Hope the blue whale. Yes, it is very crowded and some of the exhibits are a bit tired and dated but we all still love it.",So much to see ! Great for all ages ! 
"August 31, 2019","Second time visiting this amazing museum  and haven’t been disappointed. Polite and helpful staff, clean and tidy. So much to see and do ! Second time visiting and still not seen it all !! 2 must see areas are Blue Zone ; Dinosaurs and Mammals defiantly a highlight! And Red Zone ; volcanoes/ earthquakes and Human Evolution my highlights of the area! Must see T-Rex, Blue Whale and experience the earthquake room !  Central cafe nice for snakes or cold food but if wanting a meal recommend T-Rex Grill, with great decor! Great accessibility for people who struggle to walk , my mam came with me this time who struggles with osteoarthritis and made her way around fine ☺️Looking forward to my next visit !! ",Excellent museum
"August 30, 2019",Very interesting museum for adults & kids. Get there very early to avoid long queues & wait times to get in.  ,Fantastic Museum
"August 26, 2019",This amazing museum is free and has many exhibits on several levels.  Must sees include 25-meter blue whale hanging from the ceiling and the dinosaur collection.  A great place for the family. Plan to spend at least 2 hours here.,Amazing museum 
"August 26, 2019",I visit this museum every time I come here is absolutely amazing has so much to keep the kids entertained and is free in (apart from the donation box) Museum cafe is great too which caters for kids as well as adults ,Day out with my Grandson 
"August 25, 2019",Fantastic day out for all ages then popped next door to the science museum another great museum to visit but need more than a day to fully appreciate it ,Great but come prepares
"August 25, 2019",NHM is a must if visiting London but be warned. Take drinks with you. I purchased 4 bottles of water and it cost £9!!! London is expensive enough without being ripped off for water too,A must see for any London visit
"August 25, 2019",This place blew me away with what it offers across the whole history of the world. You could spend days here exploring and investigating natural history.  There is so much to see and take in it blows you away.  The use of the displays in the way the progress takes you on an adventure.  Just put this on your must do list.,A must see in London
"August 24, 2019","Our and our five year old child's favourite museum in London.Free,easy to reach,with a good and not expensive restaurant but most of all with a great permanent exhibition of dinosaurs you will surely fall in love with!",Excellent visit
"August 24, 2019","Took the boy to visit the Dino bones! He was so excited we had to tour the exhibit twice. This is a FREE museum. It is crowded but worth it. They have stegosaurus, allosaurus, iguanadon, and a sauropod- all full skeletons. They have an anamatonic T Rex too. ",Amazing!
"August 23, 2019",This museum is absolutely fantastic and with free entry! I have always wanted to visit this museum and on a recent trip we managed to fit it in. I was blown away by the artifacts and other sights in there. Definitely one to visit again and the gift shop was filled with everything you could think of!,Amazing
"August 22, 2019","We loved the space centre on the 3rd floor, very informative and lots to do. we loved it. The air space also is very interesting with lots of rockets, planes and historic memorabilia. ",Cathy
"August 22, 2019","We went there after we had visited the Science Museum. Planning the visit is great advice as it is definitely busy and you can easily get carried away and not see anything in detail. The whale is impressive, the dinosaurs and also the volcanos and earthquakes were our favourites. We did them first thing and enjoyed them thoroughly. ",Afternoon trip the the National History Museum
"November 7, 2019","I visited here with my 13 year old daughter. We were taken with the blue whale bones, Andy's clock and the the natural world area. We had coffee and hot chocolate which were nice in the central cafe. The surroundings and the building are beautiful. There is so much to see. We'd definitely love to go back some day.",An amazing place!
"November 7, 2019","Allow a whole day for the NHM! I didn’t and I wish I had! It’s an amazing place with fascinating and informative exhibits that cover the very dawn of time and our universe through the evolution of life on earth, dinosaurs and human evolution. There was also a wonderful lunar exhibit when I visited which was just stunning. The building itself is beyond beautiful and the architecture is incredible; there’s truly something for everyone at the NMH but please allow at least a whole day to get the most out of your visit! I’ll be visiting again at my first opportunity. Oh and there was an ice rink and carousel outside which were so pretty and seasonal!",Love this
"November 7, 2019","It reminded me of New York. I love bringing kids around as we have lot of fun always. the earth quake simulator is much fun for them as well. Overall is great experience and you will spend at least 2 hours inside. The moon, dinosaurs and all the little experiment you can do, it´s just catchy and fun. Last time i´ve been in July but plan to repeat soon.",Amazing learning experience for all
"November 7, 2019","Best museum I have visited and fun for everyone. Takes a while to see everything. Excellent for kids and learning by seeing. Some outdated demos, but still tell the same story. Great to see all different types of animals and such a cool mix of all different sorts. Science museum close by, so good to combine both, maybe on different days if you get tired though.",Wonderful museum!!
"November 6, 2019", We happened to be staying a few blocks from the museum & everyone recommended it so we had to visit. It did not disappoint! My daughter loved the fossil exhibits & dinosaur exhibits. The moon simply was beautiful & fascinating to me. My husband loved the animals & watching our daughter take pix of her fav things. There were loads of school groups there but we never felt over - crowded. What a treasure of a museum to have in London!,History
"November 6, 2019",I really enjoyed the Natural History Museum. But I enjoyed most of all the gems and rocks. Hundreds of different types.,Crowds of people
"November 6, 2019",We stood in line for about 45mins and the queue was about 150 metres long. So many people were packed inside it was almost impossible to see any of the exhibits. As soon as you stopped to look you got jostled or someone went in front of you. We gave up and left,Great place 
"November 6, 2019",Fantastic place to go lots to look at be prepared to be there all day and you still won’t see it all ,Brilliant
"November 6, 2019",Absolutely fantastic I recommend it to any age.The children absolutely loved it.So we went again ❤️,One of the greatest museums in the world
"November 6, 2019","In my opinion, the Natural History Museum is in a unique handful of exalted museums around the world. The lines can get very long so plan to be there at least 45 minuets before it opens at 10.00am, sooner is better so you can to try and avoid large tour groups, most of whom however try to complete the tour in about 2 hours, so they are never at one exhibit for too long. Closes underground is South Kensington, about 400 meters away. Once inside the museum you will experience truly amazing exhibits that will stimulate you to learn more about what you have seen; it's an amazing experience for children, plus like all public museums in London, it's free. If you are like me, someone who visits my granddaughters in London several times a year, we tend to spend quality time in only a few sections of the museum each visit.Cheers",Visit with kids
"November 3, 2019","So much to do here and great that they only ask for donations , we visited probably only about half of this place so need to go back to see the rest . Very busy so pick your times carefully ,we went in the morning and it was definitely busier in the afternoon .",Interesting and free place to visit if you’re visiting London...still liked the New York one better
"November 3, 2019","Two years ago, I visited the New York Natural History Museum. Having seen footage of the London one in the third instalment of ‘A Night at the Museum’ visiting it as part of our trip to London was a no brainer for my father, brother and I; especially as entry is free! The outside alone is something to see between its sandstone bricks, elaborate arched entries and windows and stain glass windows. From October to January, there’s an ice skating rink which evokes images in my mind of the closing scenes of Frozen and Rockefeller Centre. Additionally, there’s a beautiful carousel which is also something to look at while you’re waiting to enter.If you wish to see the whole museum, definitely plan for at least two days. There are multiple galleries including dinosaurs, mammals, human biology, human evolution, geology, etc. And that’s just the permanent exhibitions! Throughout the year, the museum has multiple one-off or special exhibitions. NB: although entry to the museum itself is free, special exhibitions may incur an entry fee.I’ve given the museum a 4 star rating because while there were some interesting things to see, exhibitions were lacking in the stimulation and engagement of their counterparts in New York. Using the mammals as an example, I understand the museum uses only historical collection items in keeping with their conservation policy; however, the animals are simply stood in glass cabinets one by one. In New York, they have the Ackley Hall of mammals where scenes have been created together with the stuffed animals so it looks as if they’re in their actual habitats. Something like this would go a long way toward making exhibitions more engaging.In the gift shop, I’d also like to see more unique souvenirs from local artisans. Again, using the New York museum as an example I purchased some sterling silver eagle earrings from a local artist; jewellery and souvenirs in the London one are very mass produced by comparison and generally lacking in appeal.",Great Museum
"November 3, 2019","Britain’s top Natural History Museum. It is all you’d expect and very much worth visiting. And it’s free. Except they are a bit aggressive seeking donations, and the meals are over-priced ( a sneaky way to get de facto donations).I only awarded four stars because there is not enough seating for tired visitors and because it is not quite as good as the NHM in New York. Also, a lot of the exhibits were pitched at children. Lastly, we thought the Australian exhibits of marsupials were very tired and not very lifelike. The Museum did explain they don’t want to get new ones for “ ethical reasons” but that is ridiculous! There are hundreds of kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, and wombats run over by cars in my State alone every year. Plus we cull them by the thousands to prevent overpopulation. They are not endangered, we have too many. the Museum could easily make arrangements to use these unwanted animals and thus show some decent specimens instead of the decrepit ones now on display.Kim W, Gippsland, Australia",Hungary
"November 3, 2019","Intresting exhibition we enjoyed it. Long quey at the entrance as it is free,but you can get in within short time. If you have time do not skip it.",Fantastically free fun.
"November 2, 2019",Entertaining and educational. They have an ice rink and fairground ride at the moment outside. Inside the moon exhibition is ‘spiritual and calming’. Lots of exhibits and a reasonably priced cafe. ,Best museum in the UK by far 
"November 2, 2019","Been coming her since w child and this place never fails to entertain kids and adults alike, beautiful architecture too!",Amazing! A must see!
"November 2, 2019","Never mind all the amazing things to see inside this museum 💕 The building itself is incredible! Breathtakingly beautiful 🥰 I spent most of the day there, there’s so much to see! Loved it and would go again and again! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 💕",Busy at half term 
"November 2, 2019","Big que to get in, once in very very crowded. Lots to look at but felt a bit to rushed due to the sheer volume of people to enjoy some of the great exhibits. ",Wow
"November 1, 2019","An amazingly beautiful building that is a fab place to visit with out without children. The dinosaur section was amazing. We were lucky enough to visit whilst they had the moon, a great day out that is also FREE",Brilliant
"November 1, 2019",Combines fun and educational there is so much to see and so many of the exhibits are hands on. You could spend a week there!,Amazing 
"August 14, 2019",I could look around all day in the museum. There is so much to see. I was slightly disappointed by the signs for some of the displays. Some had little to no information on what you were looking at.,Step into Hogwarts
"August 14, 2019","Being interested in natural history helps, but I'm sure you'd be amazed by this place none the less. All the exhibits are simply stunning and fills the mind with wonder, whether you're a kid or an adult. I can highly recommend a day here, but perhaps try to avoid the worst of the tourist seasons. Walking around here in a bit more tranquil atmosphere simply adds to the experience! ",Quite an experience
"August 14, 2019","Really enjoyed our few hours here, we saw only a small fraction of the place. If we had more time we’d have gone on several days.The building alone is worth it for the visit, then the exhibits are fantastic.All of this for no entry fee other than suggested donations? I don’t think you’ll see that anywhere else.Go!",Amazing resource but way too crowded
"August 13, 2019","We arrived within minutes of the museum opening and had about 30 minutes of pleasant viewing before the onslaught. It’s great to see so many people interested in Natural History and I’d hate to see such a wonderful place go down the ticket route but next time we visit it’ll be off-peak, if such a thing exists in London. Cafés and toilet facilities are excellent and proximity to the underground makes it really easy to visit. The garden which is new since our last visit was a haven of tranquility. ",No dippy
"August 13, 2019","Went specifically to view the dinosaur display only to discover that ""Dippy"" is on tour and won't return for a few years. My niece was pushed out of the way of the other dinosaur without being able to have her photo taken. Staff are good but overall I personally wasn't too impressed, too many tourists who are willing to push a 6 year old out of their way just because they have no patience.",Busy weekend
"August 12, 2019",Think we timed our visit with the busy season which was a little jarring to us however: how can you give a museum with many brilliant exhibits that is also free anything less than 5 stars!,"Great museum, but can be quite busy"
"August 12, 2019","This museum has some really amazing exhibits, one of the most popular is the dinosaur exhibit. The dinos, however, can get quite crowded so get there early. My family particular enjoyed the geological exhibits with the various rocks and gemstones. Who knew rocks could be so beautiful and fascinating? All in all, this is one of the most popular museums in London so don't be surprised if there is a queue outside. It is free of charge, but they highly appreciate donations and maps are £1.",Very nice museum
"August 11, 2019","First of all, I loved free entrance. It was packed with people but there is a lot to see. We have spent about 1-1.5 hours in there as our schedule was tight. But we stopped only at exhibitions that were for free and we were interested in. Certainly it would take a whole day to see it all or at least 6 hour. I like the options of exhibitions, diversity, and interactive parts. I was informed that some exhibitions change so it is nice to visit more than once and I am sure I will return!",A free day out for all the family.
"August 11, 2019","This is an amazing place, it has everything for all ages with lots of interesting and interactive sections for children to play and learn from.  The new moon section was excellent and took our breath away at the scale of the project. Would we go again - definitely Would we recommend- yes definitely ",Far too hot and crowded
"August 11, 2019","We were really disappointed with how busy and hot our trip was. The areas you are first taken into off the escalator are far too small and narrow to accommodate the number of visitors and we found in almost all of the rooms there was a one way system with one entry and exit point which led to no space to move freely. We couldn't wait to get out which was sad as this is the London atraction my 10 year old wanted to visit the most. The hall was beautiful but again, we spent 5 minutes in there due to the crowds. Beautiful building but sadly spoiled by the number of people there.",One word - Amazing
"August 18, 2019","In my opinion this is one of the best places to visit in London. It’s great for young and old and everyone can take away so egy from here. From architecture of the building to the amazing displays.And what is most amazing, entry is free.You simply must visit.",Interesting place to visit.
"August 17, 2019","An amazing place to visit, full of interesting and unusual things to look at. Very clean and staff very friendly and welcoming. Allow a good 3 hours to explore, gets very busy especially when it's raining...allow extra time.",Amazing place but just SO busy
"August 17, 2019","Came here on a wet Friday afternoon with my wife and 2 kids (10 and 13) so it was SO very busy. Point one - use the side entrance. When the main entrance has massive queues, go to the side entrance because the queues are so much smaller!!It's great that the museum is free but it makes for a packed museum. We got about 90 minutes to walk around. Went to see the dinosaurs and the moon exhibit as well as wander around a few of the other exhibits. Would have liked more time but it was just not to be.Had a drink in a cafe (be warned - the baguettes were nearly £8 each!!) then headed off again. This really is a wonderful museum bit it suffers for its' popularity and free entry which means you are constantly fighting with the sheer number of people there.",Dull
"August 16, 2019","I had high expectations for this as it’s such a popular attraction but as a young couple 24/25 we found it rather dull. There was a lot of information to be read, I think it would’ve been a lot more interesting if there had been interactive activities throughout.",Fantastic free museum
"August 16, 2019","We have visited this museum many times over the years,but there is always something new to discover. Lots to see and do for all ages. the queing to get in can be tedious depending on the time of day you visit. Close to underground stations and other museums.",Overwhelming!
"August 16, 2019","  I'm not sure where to begin.  This was the largest museum I've ever gone to.  There was art work from every one of the greatest artists that I've only heard of.  You could easily spend a few days here, if you have time!  Most of the museums in London are free, so cost is not a factor.  I would definitely be back in the future to see what I missed",Just wow
"August 15, 2019","I spent the evening at the NHM celebrating a wedding and without a doubt, the venue made the event what it is. The grand hall which we were situated in was absolutely beautiful where the scenic view such as the remnants of the dinosaur was something I just couldn’t take my eyes off. A great event and an exceedingly fantastic venue. ",One Amazing Museum!!
"August 15, 2019",We visited here recently and were amazed at the sheer size of the building and the number of things that were inside this fantastic museum. I loved every moment of it. This is perfect also as a rainy day activity for families. We look forward to coming again soon. ,Loads to see and it’s free!!!
"August 14, 2019",We all love this museum!  We went there for the Moon exhibition mainly but we also visited the other halls.  My children (4 & 9) love the animals and dinosaurs especially fascinated by their skeletons.  My elder one also likes the information and detail on earthquakes and volcanoes as she learnt them from school in the past academic year!The cafe we visited had yummy food which is reasonably priced given it’s in the museum.,One of the Best
"August 14, 2019","Free museum it's best to make sure you get there early, as it does get crowed. Make sure to see the museum of the moom. The whale skeleton had the little one' really talking. Young kids really love the museum.",Great day out if you have kids!
"August 2, 2019","What a wonderful museum for children and toddlers even! Lots of buttons to press and information is laid out in a simple coherent manner. It's an entertaining stroll, definitely worth a visit. Avoid weekend crowds if possible.",Interesting 
"August 2, 2019","Really cool museum, super huge, we really enjoy free entrance.You needs at least 2 hours to see it.",A salubrious location of learning and wonderment.
"August 1, 2019","The cathedral like magnificence of the architecture, the ambience of a time gone by, the academic inspiration...I am always left in awe of this great British icon.",Wonderful displays
"August 1, 2019",I loved all the displays especially the darwinian center and the collections. The architecture is more the key attraction for me than the rest of the display as you can also see the displays at other natural history museum around the world but still worthwhile,Amazingly beautiful!
"August 1, 2019","Every inch of the museum was fascinating! So much to see and learn, something interesting at every turn.",Learned a lots!
"August 1, 2019","I did the visit in a rainy day.No entrance fee. The museum suggests 5 pounds of donation.Variables contents to do, by self.Interesting for all age.There are not only dinosaures.Lots of things to learn.Highly recommended.",The Building Alone is Worth a Visit
"July 31, 2019","Totally gorgeous Alfred Waterhouse-designed building from the 19th c houses an above average collection of the usual exhibits on dinos, mammals, birds, creepy crawlers, the earth, minerals, etc. With a few exceptions, exhibits are “old-school” museum style: think lots of stuffed things mounted in glass cases. Cadogan Treasure Room at the top of the stairs is a must-see. I mean, they have a first edition Darwin & a dodo. Very cool temp exhibit on the moon. Super crowded with lots of kiddos & varying parenting styles all smushed together sometimes creates issues. But hey, it’s free. Well worth a visit just to enjoy the walk up to the entrance & to admire the design details throughout while your kids get excited about the animatronic T-Rex.",Don't go on a weekend
"July 31, 2019","Exhibits were great and well detailed, however we visited on a Saturday morning and could barely move around some of the exhibits as it was ridiculously over crowded, we felt we couldn't stay long or look around properly due to this. When we left around midday there was a queue through the grounds and round the corner to get in.",Much better ways to spend your time in London
"July 31, 2019","Spent 1 1/2 hrs here first thing in the morning. No toilet paper in some cubicles, no hand soap in most dispensers.  Most of the exhibits greasy from 1000's of hands. Housekeeping needs a shake up. Had possibly the worse muffin I have ever eaten at the cafe in the top floor. Exhibits-nothing captivating. Because the museum is free, it seems every school group visiting London goes there, so be prepared for a lot of groups.",Family Holiday 2019
"July 30, 2019",It is an excellent way to spend time in London. It is great for children and adults alike and is reasonably accessible by public transport,Too Busy! 
"August 10, 2019",Although it's incredible and I think that it is important it is free and accessible! We were being pushed round by enormous crowds there was no chance to read anything! I wonder if putting tickets online or having a certain number of entries per hour would be better! It was disappointing not to be able to look around more in detail! The building is beautiful and has some amazing exhibits! Although some of the dinosaurs need a clean as they have layers of dust on their bones! I have always loved this museum and just think it needs organising a bit better to allow it's wonder to be enjoyed by all! ,Shuffling around in a crowd
"August 9, 2019","My childhood memories of this place revolve around acres of display cases containing every possible variety of bird, insect, mammal, fish or rock that the Victorians had stuffed and/or mounted. Today it is only the minerals section that reflects that experience. The rest seems to be a dumbed down Natural History lite. Have to say that the minerals section made the visit worth it for me.",Great Museum in a Great City
"August 8, 2019","My husband, 5yo daughter and I had the opportunity to visit the Natural History Museum on a rainy Sunday morning.  The crowds were quite vast when we arrived, but people entered the facility with little delay.  I couldn't help but think of ""Night at the Museum"" when I walked into the huge entry hall.  It's massive and exactly what I would envision a NHM to look like.  Bones of a whale above head.  Glass enclosures containing various exhibits all around.The hallways were very easy to follow, especially given the map.  Plenty of hands on activity for the little ones in areas relating to the human body, reproduction, sight, memory and more.  My daughter wanted to touch, push, crank and jump on anything and everything.The trek through the dinosaur exhibit was tough.  Very crowded.  But plenty to see all around.  It was pretty fascinating, though not my favorite location in the museum.If you head to London, I vote for the NHM as a must see.  Educational fun for the whole family!",Just excellent 
"August 7, 2019","If you are thoroughly interested in palaeontology, just a great museum. The nature is jaw dropping, amazing.",Breathtaking experience
"August 7, 2019","The interior is amazing and you feel like you have entered another world. The staircase is majestic and the whale skeleton is awesome.  Very interesting artefacts to view, especially if it's raining outside. Be careful as it might get a little bit crowded.",Amazing museum !!
"August 6, 2019","Excite experience! The Moon room was amazing!incredible minerals collection,  You must take a picture from de giant Sequoia!After the visit, you must keep walking across the Exhibition road until reaching the garden entrance...",Love this place
"August 6, 2019","Made many visits here and still love the place ever since I was a child. Fantastic building and worth a visit for that alone,  Awesome!!",Great visit for families.
"August 5, 2019","This is a world class museum. The dinosaur exhibit never fails to impress  but there are also great exhibits on earthquakes, the moon, human development and other well done topics. Free admission, lots of interactive bits for kids. Avoid lunch at the T-Rex Cafe if yoou can. Service is slow and food mediocre.",Definitely worth visiting 
"August 5, 2019",The outside of the museum looks amazing. Inside there is a large collection of dinosaur skeletons and stuffed animals. There are also exhibitions on human evolution and the effects of earthquakes and preventing them. ,So crowded...and hot!
"August 4, 2019","OK, I guess a natural history museum is geared towards children, but holy cow, the place was insane! We visited on a rainy day, so people were looking for indoor activities and there is no entry fee. So many people, so many children, so loud, so crowded, so hot and stuffy! Some good exhibits, but the crowds made it difficult to see things well and most exhibits had lots of reading panels; the crowds made it impossible to go through things slowly enough to read them. And forget it if you get separated from your party...you'd never find them again. I'm sure we missed some great things, but it was hard to navigate such an expansive place with so many people. Had to get out.",Very good but very crowded and quite dusty
"July 10, 2019","It was our first visit to Natural History Museum. We chosen Saturday to visit this museum, I know it was a bad idea. Whole place was crowded, especially the Dinosaurs exhibition (I know it's probably the most popular one). One day is not enough to see all exhibitions and learn everything about all zones but it's enough to quickly explore all (free) exhibitions (or at least most of it). I was very excited to visit Dinosaurs exhibition but I have to say that I loved Blue Zone, especially minerals and the vault more. Every zone of the museum was very interesting with a lot of different display types. Great, fun day for kids and adults. I have to say something about amount/layers of dust on some of the displayed items, especially in the Blue zone (mammals section) it was horrendous (I know I'm picky and I know those are hard to reach places). It's a must see/visit attraction and I would definitely come back, but not on Saturday :)",Good Fun
"July 10, 2019",Good fun for kids and adult as you learn some amazing facts. Definitely worth a visit for all ages ..,Great
"July 9, 2019","Soo much to see do and Learn,will definitely  be back  only point is it does get quite hot and stuffy inside. ",Natural History - love this place
"July 9, 2019","As I used to live in London before I've been here a couple of times but I make a point to go even on a short stay there. This is one of my favorite two museums in London and I recomend everyone to go there! It's so much to see and they have a lot of different exhibitions. I like the ones about earth and it's history the best and I love the part of the escalator going up and through earth, even as an adult I enjoy that. I would recomend that part of the museum for sure but it do has something for everyone and for all ages.Things from different kinds of animals of today to dinosaurs and to creatures in the ocean. Earth and it's history, fossils and rocks, planets ec ec ec.The museum itself is also a very cool and fabolous building, even for the building itself you should go. However depending on when you go, some parts are full of kids and other people. Especially the dinosaurs are a big popular one and is often crowded. If you have the time you should go early in the day.I've not yet tried the cafe though since it's a bit of an open space and it's usefully full of kids which I'm not a fan of, the giftshop is great to! :')Dont' have much to say more then that you should go!",Perfect day out
"July 8, 2019",Underestimated how long you needed.  Easily all day could be spent here.  Wide range of exhibits to see. Clean and lots of staff available to help.  Would recommend a picnic as food wasn't broad and very overpriced.,Excellent school trip with my 5 year old 
"July 8, 2019","I have been to the Natural History Museum before as a child with my secondary school as well as an adult with my then 2 year old child (3 years ago). This time we visited as part of my child's school trip. It was a totally different experience because there is a designated area in the museum for school children where there is a very big cloak room/lunch area/prep talk benches as well as the usual toilets. The museum itself never fails to amaze me. My daughter didn't remember much of it when we previously visited because she was too young but this time she really loved seeing the dinosaurs and learn about different animals and their habitat, humans and our environment in general. I think it is a great day out for all ages and although it was very busy with different types of visitors it was still very fun and exciting. I cannot recommend the Natural History Museum enough and we will be back to see more because we did not have enough time to explore during the school trip. ",Great museum for young and old
"July 8, 2019",We were really impressed by the Natural History Museum. We had 3 days in London and this was the main reason we decided to visit initially. We spent 4 hours here in total. And that was on a very hot day with kids who were quite tired. There was something to keep them interested around each corner. Dinosaur section is incredible. We loved the Cocoon as you get to understand the experiments that take place. The Moon installation that was in place is really well done. The escalator going through the globe and the earthquake sections are brilliant too.Having paid a lot of money for other attractions I felt that this was the best thing to do in London for us.,Cool place 
"July 7, 2019","Absolutely love this place, the building architecture is fantastic and possibly the best looking building In London. Everything inside is cool to see and it’s free which an added bonus! Worth a visit.",Love to visit the Museum
"July 6, 2019","The Natural History Museum is fantastic BUT it is confusing and not very clearly signed inside. The new Blue Whale centrepiece has freed up space in the main hall so that has helped the over-crowding and it is a fantastic exhibit. I look forward to the bronze Dippy in the grounds. It was very hot and stuffy this week (in July).I would like to see some reorganisation to make the museum ""flow"" better.",Very large and clean facilities
"July 6, 2019",So many things to see and do. We were pressed for time and wished we could spend more time but theres so much to do in London. Everything is kept in great condition. Id say its better for families with children. ,Slightly disappointing
"July 6, 2019","I feel like I'm being a wee bit harsh in only giving the museum stars but I was slightly disappointed in it. There's certainly plenty there that is educational and there are some fine displays in this beautiful and large building, but I thought reasonable amount of it was a bit old hat. Museums all over the world have changed quite a lot over the past 25 years and become quite innovative in the manner in which they present information and displays, and I felt that this museum has a little bit of work to do to catch up.",Great
"July 5, 2019","Visited the museum primary for the photography competition which was a bit expensive, but the general museum was very good spent several hours here and still more to go back and see",Excellent exhibits suitable for all ages
"July 4, 2019","Fascinating, informative, interactive exhibits suitable for all ages. The prehistoric whale skeleton was jaw dropping as was the rest of the dinosaur exhibit. The museum is well laid out and color coded making wayfinding easy. Worth the trip!",Don’t let the crowds dissuade you
"July 3, 2019","Setting aside the extraordinary architecture, it reminds me of the Smithsonian in DC. If you are a science nerd and want to see what a dodo bird looked like before it became extinct, or to get a sense of how really massive a blue whale is, this is the place to visit. And it won’t cost you a farthing.",Must see if visiting London
"July 3, 2019","Outstanding museum located in western London, just a stones throw away from Hyde Park. Lots of information and exhibits to look at, great for all ages! I particularly enjoyed the blue whale skeleton, the replica of the moon and the cross section of a giant sequoia - in the museum since 1893 and was over 1,300 years old when cut down! The wildlife garden is also a great place to visit for a peaceful stroll, or to sit in the sun and relax a little.  It is a must see attraction when visiting London, especially on a rainy day. Best of all, its free!",FABULOUS AND INTERESTING VISIT!
"July 3, 2019","We both have not visited this museum for many years and now we wonder why?A really exceptional day out - free entrance - reasonable price tostore bags and luggage so you can wander unhindered - excellent coffee, cakes and scones that were reasonably pricedand toilets that worked!! What more could you want together with the World leading collections and exhibitions, OUTSTANDING",Family visit
"July 3, 2019","We visited with our son and his  partner and grandchildren of 11 and 13. It was the children's  first visit and they thoroughly enjoyed it, although it was rather hot and crowded. There is an awful lot to see and bit is very informative for the children,",Dinosaur lovers delight!
"July 2, 2019",We went on Fathers day and it was packed but the Dinosaurs made it well worth it. There were quite a few interactive dinosaur exhibits which were fun to watch. I also enjoyed the minerals and the images of nature. We ate at the nice family restaurant called the Kitchen where you could get a hot meal which was very good. ,"Great Museum, fascinating exhibits"
"July 2, 2019","Great museum, wonderful exhibits and displays. We were there mid-week about three in the afternoon at the end of June, before english school holidays however, the crowds forced us leave after an hour. Our grandchildren loved whatever we managed to seeAdvice, go early morning before the crowds.",Great museum
"July 2, 2019",My Grandchildren love it here. There is a lot see and do. Some interactive activities too. There is a restaurant which serves really nice food. Some of the animals on show are showing their age a bit as they have been there for quite a long time. There are usually quite long queues to get in...but it usually moves quickly. The dinosaur section is always a favourite. A good place to visit to keep the children occupied and interested.,A huge museum with tons of animal specimens and information about the Earth
"June 5, 2019","So many animals! From a whale skeleton to dinosaur bones to tons of birds from all over the world, this place has an amazing animal collection. In addition, it has an impressive collection of other artifacts and information about the Earth (minerals, gems, etc.). I spent a few hours there and feel like I barely scratched the surface of what there was to see.",Fantastic Museum
"June 4, 2019",Even the building itself is spectacular.  Wonderful collection.  Give yourself plenty of time to get around.,A definite must
"June 4, 2019",I was amazed and very much entertained coming. It was really good that the entrance is free and only requires donation but even then if there's entrance payment involved i still think its a must. I could spend the whole day on this museum if i can.,Birthday treat 
"June 4, 2019",Girlfriend had never been so surprised her with a trip for her 40th birthday celebrations and really enjoyed the day out,Great adventure
"June 4, 2019",You can spend the whole day and have the greatest time of your life with your kids.  Every zone is very interesting and very easy to go around.,great family day
"June 4, 2019",we squeezed in a 3 hour visit here which was not enough.  it was mainly to see the dinosaurs but so much to see there.  it is great and in a fab building.  we arrived at 9.45 on a monday morning and the queue looked long but as soon as doors opened we were in within 5 minutes,great museum.  take time to see it.
"June 3, 2019","We planned to spend half a day here and were sure glad we did.  Even the outside of the museum building is dramatic.  It looks more like a cathedral than a museum. I am a whale nut and the first thing we saw was a giant model of a blue whale. of course we had to see the whole whale display.  A very educational section well worth spending time there.  We then explored the dinosaur section.  great display of fossils.  maybe the only complaint was that some of the displays were covered with dust.  I know they are fragile, but it would be nice to clean them somehow.  There was an unsual Moon sculpture made of hundreds of photographs.  There are a number of galleries we didn't have time to see.  I would strongly recommend taking a few hours to see this great museum.",Beautiful Building
"June 3, 2019",The building is one of the most amazing buildings I have ever seen. It’s amazing to think it was designed in the 1800’s. The exhibits pale when compared to the building itself. It’s free entrySo do yourself a favour and visit when you can.,Learn and experience
"June 3, 2019","Modern museum - you can touch, ask, experience. Amazing moon and really good idea of showing how earthquake feels. Well prepared for kids but it is also a lot of fun for adults.",Superior artifacts
"June 3, 2019","Another great museum to visit. A lot of history and interesting artifacts. When you’re among the hundreds of thousands of years of history, it’s hard to pass through quickly. There is just so much to look at and take in.",Dinosaurs!
"June 9, 2019",The Natural History Museum is a short walk from the Science Museum and the V&A. It's huge and you can easily spend an entire day here. Highlights included the mechatronic T-Rex and the taxidermy hummingbirds. It's free to get in but eat before you go because the cafe is expensive.,"Great building, some excellent exhibits, please bring back more stuff"
"June 8, 2019","This was a long awaited return after many years, but it was quite disappointing in places but with some good stuff mixed in. Highlights are the spectacular building, whale and excellent moon exhibition/installation. The geology section and hominids were also pretty good. The downside for me was the relatively superficial exhibits in places which while probably excellent for small children, did leave me a little cold. The dinosaur hall in particular was so contrived, felt too theme Parkish in style, and I felt too much space was sacrificed at the expense of actual exhibits. I hope the museum will look at the balance and perhaps have a bit more of the “real thing” and a bit less of a walk through a science class. I am very sympathetic to the need to provide an opportunity for children in particular to learn about the natural world, but I sometimes think as adults we are too over protective and almost patronising to our kids. By having more objects on display we can add extra mystery and excitement by adding the dimension of the unknown and allow everyone to ask questions or try to figure some things out for themselves - that in itself is a joy. I would however in the positive column say this is a personal view and the overall quality and information of the exhibits and galleries were really good, with clear explanations throughout. I must also compliment the restaurant and cafe as being of good quality and environment. Very pleasant way to spend an afternoon, free admission, but very happy to have made a donation.",Cool and beautiful 
"June 8, 2019",We usually have a short museum stay with our kids because everyone gets bored after a while. Two awesome things about this museum 1. You don’t have to stand in a ticket line and can just donate money2. It is set up really well with amazing things that everyone thought was so interesting. We went one hour one day and an hour another day and it was a perfect museum balance for our family. ,Fab Fun Trip
"June 8, 2019","Visit the history museum today (8th June) & wasn’t disappointed, so much to see, so much to do, very clean & tidy. Food and drink tad expensive but with donation entry I was happy to pay for it! Second time we’ve been, highly recommended!!",Spectacular Building
"June 8, 2019",The building is spectacular. I think we enjoyed the building so much that we were distracted from viewing the collection. The museum has lots and lots to see. ,Busy
"June 7, 2019",Would have got 5 stars had there not been so many school trips there. Should do adults only days. Whale good and so was the moon.,An amazing museum 
"June 6, 2019","It was a sunny day yesterday，you can see the appearance of the museum very clearly. It is also said to be the setting for the museum's wonderful night movie, so it looks particularly familiar. The building is magnificent. Upon entering the door, I was attracted by the skeleton fossils of the large mammontosaurus. In addition, here almost covers the complete biological evolution history of the earth and the specimens of most of the creatures on the earth. The exhibits are so comprehensive and rich that they are mind-boggling. They are really wonderful and informative. Another interesting exhibit is the moon museum.This moon was photographed by NASA on a scale of 1:500,000. In addition, the moon is not regularly shown on a global scale and is about two months away from its next destination. You can take the subway to the south kensington station and walk about five minutes to see the museum.",Great museum for kids in London
"June 6, 2019","Great for kids and not only! A lot of interesting facts, interactive exhibitions and things to learn both for kids and adults! Probably not the best place for kids under 2 y.o. as they seemed to be bored but my 8 y.o. was very excited and will remember this visit for years!",Our fav London museum
"June 5, 2019",Dinosaurs!! That was our youngest daughter when we told her about this place. We spent a half day here during our stay in London and it flew by. My only criticism is that there should be a way to pay to enjoy fast track entry. The museum is free but the lines can be long. It’s great that it’s free but some pay would prefer to pay for the privilege of not having to wait so long. Other than that it was superb. Our favourite London museum!,This is my son's favorite museum in London.
"June 5, 2019","This is my son's favorite museum in London. Loves towatching animals and birds, and most of all, the missing millions of years ago, skeletons of dinosaurs, examples of various forms of life and many other interesting exhibits of the world flora and fauna.",Amazing
"May 31, 2019","The most awesome collection of crystals, gems and: stones, if you interested in such. Also a great show of the Moon. Free entrance, it is up to you to donate if and how much you want. Please donate, I promise it is worth every penny.",Great
"May 31, 2019",I cannot visit London without a stop at this museum.  For this visit we focus on human body.  This was very interesting,"Very nice museum, worth visiting"
"May 31, 2019","It's a big museum, yet you can spend around two hours there and see most of it.The building itself is very nice, take a look on it outside and inside too.The museum is free.Suitable for children and all people too. There are dinosaurs and other interesting exhibits like animals, rocks and moon findings too.You can spend there few hours, depends on what you like to see and if you bring children who may find lots of interesting things for them.",Masterpiece
"May 30, 2019",Natural History Museum is a masterpiece to learn many things for people of all ages. The entrance is also magnificent.,Very impressed 
"May 30, 2019",The architecture of the building itself was much to admire and there was plenty of interesting thing inside including a blue whale skeleton and it is free ,Absolutely Wonderful!
"May 29, 2019","The outside of the building is beautiful enough to grab your attention, it's gorgeous! The inside of the building is just as beautiful as the outside! This was not at the top of our list of must sees while in London but I am so happy that we went. You can donate any amount to enter the museum and it is very large so you can spend as much or as little time in there as you want. I wish we would have had more time to spend in there because there was a lot I know we didn't get to see. Will definitely visit again on our next trip!",I love it a lot
"May 29, 2019","This is an outstanding place for everybody who loves life and nature and science. A lot of info especially for kids. Yes, too many people, but this museum is for everybody!",A great way to spend a few hours
"May 29, 2019","Mary Anning’s ichthyosaur, a moon exhibit and a huge sequoia! Well done NHM! A busy half term but still lots of space and toilets etc...",Top level activity
"May 29, 2019","Top level activity for any type of visitor. Children are really enjoy it. Good facilities and services inside Museum. Museum has a plenty points where we can take a break and have a snack, it is especially important when you came for a few hours visit and/or with children. Came a couple times before this visit and will come back again with kids in future.",A great Natural History Museum 
"May 28, 2019",I love the displays of the assorted animals around the world. They have a lot of educational displays. The earthquake and natural disaster displays were great. The inside is impressive. It is also free. It’s a must see museum. Next door check out the science museum then Victoria Albert Museum is near by.  ,Interesting and Crowded
"May 17, 2019","A beautiful structure filled with interesting exhibits.  You are greeted by the skeleton of a blue whale upon entry.  The dinosaur exhibit is short, but well done.  My favorite was the Marine portion with the models of the various creatures.  My negatives mainly involved the crowds of school children that ran amuck.  Loud and choatic, it lessened my enjoyment.  Also, the staff was few and always involved, which made it difficult to ask any questions.  Overall good experience.",Beautiful Building
"May 17, 2019",This building always looks amazing and inviting from the outside but once you get inside there is so much to see.  Amazing pieces of history preserved for us all to enjoy.,Amazing museum
"May 16, 2019",My cousin went to London and I took him went to the museum and it was amazing. I had a photo in a ginormous dinosaur skeleton but I couldn’t find it in my gallery to post it here but it was like 8 years ago though but an absolutely great experience during my stay in London.,So much to see
"May 15, 2019",The building is beautiful. The architecture is amazing. Inside there is so much to see. The dinosaur exhibit was our favorite. The gem exhibit is insane. We actually quit looking halfway through my eyes were crossed. The museum is free but they do ask for a £5 donation. For a family of 4 that is a great price. It's a must see. ,A must
"May 15, 2019","Just come enjoy some  houres. See dinasours, bluewhale  ( realy big) . How the world Was made . Set off 3 houres at least.",Not to be missed with chidren

"May 13, 2019","The building itself is beautiful and inside is just as amazing. So many exhibits to see and keeps the whole family entertained.We also were lucky enough to be there when the ice skating rink opened, great fun.",Cant Be Beaten
"May 12, 2019","Took a 4 yr old , it was quite busy and we limited our time there but it was excellent , if you are in town with time to spare its way worth it , dinosaur exhibit alone is good enough !!",Quick visit 
"May 11, 2019",Whether you have time to visit the museum floor by floor and room by room or just have a quick look on the first floor you’re bound to be astonished.,Truely amazing place.
"May 10, 2019",Truely amazing place to visit if you like crowds. It was the weekend though so it should be busy. A must see buT allow plenty of time to look around.,Lots  & lots to see and admire
"May 7, 2019","There is lots to see, and something that will always interest you. It is very big and you can depending on your time spend more than half a day here.",Great activity for all ages
"May 6, 2019","We went there at an Sunday morning. I guess on sunylny days it's not so crowded like usually. We came directly on the morning and had not to queue.The building is impressive, special the big hall with the wale inside. It's decided into several parts and that makes it easier to plan it. It's also step free access.But some exhibitions, e.g. The dinosaur department was so crowded that it's not fun with a toddler going through. ",Birthday Weekend
"May 6, 2019","The Natural History museum is a great place to visit, our children love it here.  The only think stopping me putting 5* were the crowds.  I had to leave my husband and children in the dinosaur area because it was just to much.  It’s one of those places where you wish you were David Attenborough and could go when everyone else has gone home.","A cathedral to nature, constantly evolving "
"May 6, 2019","The building is a museum in itself. It stunning majesty  of the blue whale as you enter, the open atrium and the bridge all make this a humbling day, learning of the complexity of nature, our impact the the power of the natural world.Enjoy the dinosaurs, the hailstorm of how they were collected and the minibeasts, birds and sea creatures,  but take time to look through the locked doors at the research libraries, the plans for the future and the knowledge of this imposing building.This is a full day out. We left as it closed and it had more to tel us. The geological section about rocks, earthquakes and volcanoes was well presented and engaging. There are a lot of interactive displays for children and information for older children and parents, well presented and informative. The blue whale in the atrium sums up the purpose of the museum well and the history of its purpose, designs and design are well worth a read. This is a beautiful creation, the detail in the design can be missed if you rush around. Take time to sit and look for the detail on the roof design and the archways.The earthquake simulation give a real sense of the enormity and fear with an earthquake that was in our lifetime. An absolute must visit, but give it a good amount of time - not to be rushed. ",Red Zone
"May 6, 2019",Wonderful exhibition on Human Evolution in the Red Zone. This museum has a lot of children visitors and there seemed to be a little less in this exhibit. Would definitely recommend (not just because there were less children). Volcanoes and Earthquakes was a great exhibit as well which includes an earthquake simulator and give you the chance to feel what it was like in Japan during the 2011 earthquake. Lots of interesting statistics plus an explanation of the different scales (like Richter).,Excellent
"May 5, 2019","I was there with friends for few hours, but you can be there few days and it will be interesting. Amazing place with amazing history things. ",Fantastic and vibrant 
"May 5, 2019","What a lovely museum to bring children to! This is a place you can stay for hours. They have Interactive meetings with dinosaurs and the understanding of Mother Earth. I found it a bit hard to navigate in the beginning, but after understanding the consept it was easier. Would love to go back!",To do with kids
"May 4, 2019","If your kids like culture and learn new things, this is a must. Earthquake, volcanos, dinosaurs... there is for all the tastes. Shame they only open at 10 ",Dinosaurs without an entrance fee😎
"May 4, 2019","It was a very good experience despite the crowd. It is free and you can see so many things especially dinosaur's bones. The building itself is amazing, check the details.",Fantastic museum visit
"May 4, 2019",This is a must visit in London. It's a fantastic museum for all ages. The main entrance is impressive and the exhibits are very informative. It's free entry but donations are welcomed.,Flatters to Deceive - relies on its reputation
"September 8, 2019","I have looked forward to going here since I was a child.Whilst I enjoyed many of the exhibits, I was disappointed by the following:1. The dinosaur exhibition is a shambles - dark, dingy and cramped - akin to walking through Ikea. There was no room to step back and savour the models at all.2 The restaurant is ridiculously expensive and the food poor. Cleanliness of the food area was also poor.3 The exhibits in the main hall are poorly chosen. The whale is disappointing in scale, far less imposing than the full size model in the animal hall4 The moon exhibition was a waste of a room. A giant paper mache moon. Really?5 The wildlife garden is the biggest waste of space in London. Overall, there are some amazing exhibits but the staging is very poor.",Disappointing!
"September 8, 2019","Having visited similar museums around the world, I found this a let down considering its London.  Yes, there were interesting  and informative displays of animals, minerals and plants, but could be so much better.  There was no wow factor and everything just felt mediocre. Visit mid-week, in winter and/or on opening for any chance of avoiding the crowds! Good points:- Its free, but you are made to line up and pass a barrage of donation boxes and even contact less payment options!- The actual building has beautiful architecture- Friendly staff- Across the road from the V&A which I found far more interestingBad points:- Only limited rooms had a fan or air conditioning, so it was incredibly hot and stuffy- No clear route to follow and many times I had to go back through an entire exhibit just to visit the next- Hard to know if I missed entire areas- The dinosaur section was more for toddlers- Some exhibits looked dated and few were tactile or interactive - Multiple dead ends! I'd be looking at an exhibit, then suddenly there was a barrier or need to back track to get out!- Very limited toilets. The womens on the ground floor had a long queue out the door every time I went past!  Luckily I found another in the Darwin centre which was quiet.- There was an overpriced cafe or shop at every turn!Despite the heat and crowds, I managed to see all sections (I think anyway?) and was out after 1hr 15mins.  I might have stayed longer if it wasn't so crowded and hot.",Interesting visit with young grandchildren
"September 8, 2019","I am disabled and was able to book to park in the grounds, very helpful staff. Was in my wheelchair, my electric scooter was too big with the crowds . Would recommend bringing a picnic, very nice area for it. Not too impressed with the food, not good to eat and rather expensive",Nice Exhibition of Nature
"September 8, 2019","Comprehensive look into nature complete with lots of dinosaur exhibits. The extremely large whale was most impressive. During our visit, a special exhibit with a model of the moon lit up a giant darkened room. The museum was very busy on a Sunday with many family visits - travelers would probably get a better experience on weekdays...","Interesting overall, excellent for families"
"September 8, 2019","Excellent family oriented natural history museum, with many hands on and explanatory exhibits about our natural world. And beneath those, you can see the bones of an older approach to museum curation. This is obviously true architecturally, with Victorian design and brickwork popping out here and there, but also in some exhibits. Some galleries display birds and animals with classic approaches to taxidermy (and a few comparative anatomy displays even have century old labels). Wish we'd had more time, and maybe a few grandchildren to share the visit with!",Rubbish
"September 8, 2019",So went with a friend for the first time in maybe 10 years. Its barely changed.  Most of the exhibits look dated.  Most of the interactive displays are broken or just make some lights flash.  Got bored and left after a while.  Not impressed at all.  If I'd had to pay I'd have asked for a refund.,Don't go on the weekend
"September 8, 2019","Its not one of my highest rated museums. The architecture of the building itself is stunning! I think we made the mistake of going on a weekend. After the intial 30 minute line up to get in the front door it was full of familys with todlers and small children running around, personally just not my scene for a museum. The moon installation was very cool. The red zone was probably the best. It was a little upsetting that the dinosaur section was geared towards 4 year olds but glad that the next generation can enjoy it.",Average 
"September 8, 2019","There are many sections here, Birds,Dinosaurs, Mammals, sea creatures, unique stones,  plants, Human production and other factual gadgets.Free admission. My son liked the dinosaur section. Spare an hour to spend here. Place is packed and it's 500 meters from Tube station. C U Around ",Brilliant Tour
"September 8, 2019","We visited the museum and booked onto a tour of the highlights of the museum.  Barbara our tour guide was very informative, enthusiastic and all round gave us a brilliant experience.  The highlights as explained by Barbara brought the exhibits to life, a very enjoyable hour.",Awe inspiring.
"September 8, 2019",Beautiful building in the heart of Kensington. The variety of the natural world is represented here in all its glory. The children will love it.,Big kids and little kids
"September 4, 2019",Everything is very well displayed and no matter how often you go there is always something else to see.,Very informative 
"September 4, 2019",Great place beautiful building jam packed with information old and new. Something of interest for everyone. Staff are very knowledgeable and helpful. Can't believe there's no admission fee although there are donation boxes which i did contribute too.Great day out its a must place to visit.,Dinosaur trip
"September 4, 2019","Trip to see dinosaurs with grandson.  He took us round, aged 4.   Shop first for a toy (Lego box), walk round. Use ur to see dinosaurs and then T. rex cafe fir lunch.   Use in Monday ore school and cafe staff like death warmed up.  Food good worth the staff delay.  All in all a very pleasant way to spend a day out.  Enhanced of course by travelling there by train",Family day out
"September 3, 2019",My children really enjoyed looking around. The amenities were great especially having a room for breastfeeding. It was extremely hot inside probably forgot to put the air conditioning on. Would love to visit again,Enormous and full of amazing stuff 
"September 3, 2019","Incredible building,  amazing architecture and so full of incredible specimens.  It was very crowded the day we were there with many schools doing end of year trips, so that was a bit challenging at times but couldn't be helped.   Our only issue was the lack of air circulation,   everything was very stuffy so we found ourselves needing to head outside regularly for some fresh air. Would definitely recommend if museums and animals are your thing.",Really good museum
"September 3, 2019","We visited with grandchildren aged 7 and 5. The main reason was to see the dinosaurs. Surprisingly, and pleasingly, other exhibits got more of their attention especially the whales.they just couldn't believe how big a whale can be. A pleasant few hours were spent.of course it cost me in the gift shops, but items were not the usual ripoff prices, so kids were happy as was my wallet","Worth a visit for sure, and it's free!"
"September 3, 2019","This place seems to be a great visit for all ages. Whether you're interested in history or not, the exhibits themselves are well laid out to catch your eye at every step inside!The exterior needs it's own post as that it something which WILL drop your jaw.Well worth a visit.",Well worth a visit with young family
"September 3, 2019",I think a lot of the exhibits may be geared towards older children but we found lots to do with our 4 year old. Spent 3 hours there and probably only covered a third of the museum. The dinosaur and animal exhibits were definite winners as was the earthquake sections. Plenty of cafes too for a short drink and snack break. ,Very good
"September 3, 2019","Lots of things to see. The main attraction, the dinosaur room is very nice with a manageable amount of people. Dippy the diplodocus was currently on tour when we went, so they replaced him with Hope, the massive blue whale welcoming you on the foyer.",Not as good as the one in New York 
"September 2, 2019","Free admission,  free wifi, Small exhibition Nice for  children.You can finish the whole tour in 2  hours.",Must see for kids
"May 4, 2019","It was amazing, the huge displays, detailing, coverage... very encouraging for kids and adults. It is pretty exhaustive too, so plan for two days or be ready for a 4-5 hour visit if only one day.",nostalga and amazment
"May 3, 2019","We went to the natural history museum whilst in london, its really close to kensington tube station, so really easy to get to, the place is stll amazing as it was when i went as a small boy, the dinosaw fossils are awe inspiring, ant the animatronic T-REX leaves children and adults a gasp, the whale exibition is beath taking, okay some of the exibits are a bit old but then it is a history museum, Well worth a visit and great for children, Darwin would approve.",Great museum
"May 2, 2019","A definite must see if you are in London and have a few hours to see and experience all things science. Make sure you go early as the queues to get in can take up to an hour, if not longer. The dinosaur exhibit and the human biology exhibits were very good, there were some repair works going on when we went which was a shame as some parts of the museum were closed.The layout was a little confusing so some more signage would be good",Prepare to have your mind blown.
"April 30, 2019",i know..seams a cliché..but prepare to have your mind blown...it s one of the best museum that i ve ever seen..,Amazing visit
"April 30, 2019",This experience reminds of me of a harry potter movie. The building outside what an awesome sight and when you go in you definitely need a half a day for this exploring.Its free,Absolutely amazing!
"April 29, 2019","This museum is massive, and it would be impossible to cover it all in a day.  There is a great flow to the exhibits, and there is something for everyone.  Take your kids here to learn - very fun and interactive, but not over complicated.  We first walked by mid day on a Saturday and there was a huge line all the way back to the main gate.  We tried again on Sunday around 9:30 am (opens at 10 am) and it was perfect.  Do be warned this place gets very busy as it is free to enter.",INTERESTING AND FUN
"April 28, 2019",We visited the museum and to be honest we had a great time. It did not let us down. Plenty to see and do. Highly recommended. ,interesting visit 
"April 25, 2019","We arrived just before opening and the queue was already huge! We got in pretty quickly when it opened though. Such a great free venue to see lots of interesting exhibits. Our sons loves the dinosaur section. Amazing building, clean toilets and great cafe too. ",Its free and its awesome
"April 24, 2019","This is a must visit attraction in london guys. It has something for everyone. My children and spouse loved it. + Direct access from a metro+ Clean place, disciplined staff, nice exhibits+ restrooms were adequate and were OKShould've reached earlier in the day and see it completely. Hit LIKE if my review helped you in planning your trip any better.",Dinosaurs! 
"April 23, 2019",A beautiful building to view before entering!We took the children to see the dinosaurs and they didn't disappoint. The building is stunning.Plenty there to do that is suitable for all ages. ,Never disappoints
"March 30, 2019","We have been here every London visit and it never disappoints!The galleries are well kept and well managed, the collection is massive and the changing exhibitions are really interesting.The cafe is decent too.A perfect day out, especially since you can go have lunch in Wagamama in high St Kensington, few minutes away, do a little shopping and then to back in for another round in the afternoon! ",Natural History Museum
"March 29, 2019","This museum is wonderful for everyone, and if you have children they will be very happy to visit it! The area with dinosaurs is fascinating, and the architecture of the place is amazing!",Excellent place to take and educate kids.
"March 28, 2019","I went with my 2 kids, they enjoyed and learned a lot of things about dinosaurs, other animals and natural topics during the visit to the museum.",Jurassic Park with Dippy
"March 26, 2019","It was a night at the Museum watching Jurassic Park! One of my favourite films when I was a child. I love visiting the Natural History Museum anyway but when I saw this opportunity I couldn’t wait. The whole experience was magical, we were able to explore the Wildlife Photographer of the Year before the film started - which was incredible. The film was presented in the main hall and we were seat directly underneath the blue whale skeleton. As I love the film already I got engrossed and forgot there was a massive skeleton above my head, making me jump a few times. The environment definitely made the film more tense and spectacular. The event was organised with plenty of staff from the entrance, being seated and leaving. There was refreshments and complimentary popcorn, highly recommend and we can’t wait to book our next event with Luna Cinema - Jaws in water dinghy?",Excellent!
"March 25, 2019",truly enjoyable so much to see. at every turn we were amazed.  it's immense.  great for picture taking if you don't use flash.  so much historical information and fascinating items of antiquity.  you'll love it.,Nice Enough 
"March 24, 2019",We decided to give this place a try and we really enjoyed it especially because it is free. There are a large number of impressive exhibitions from birds to dinosaurs so it is a good few hours worth of entertainment. I would recommend this place to visit if you are coming to London as it's certainly an experience you won't forget however there are a few things to consider before you go:1. If you want to feel like school sports day this is the place for you because there are children charging around all over the place to the point where I'm sure I shoulder barged some where they ran into me and bounced off because they weren't looking where they were going. So something needs to be done about the number of people they allow in. 2. The cafe/restaurant is quite poor with limited numbers of tables. The table we sat at was very wonky and I had a lovely shower of breakfast tea on my leg when my girlfriend picked up her coffee. So they need to sort this out. Other than these points it's well worth a visit. ,Must see if you are in London
"March 22, 2019","An amazing place to go to. It is so amazing that they have preserved so much so beautifully. The entry to the museum is free.The map guide to the museum costs 1 pound.There are various zones for dinosaurs, mammals, creepy crawlers, birds, earth, marine animals.There are a couple of restaurants within the museum.There are three souvenir shops within the museum.The dinosaur section is very interesting for kids. It's an absolute treat to see.MUST SEE IF YOU ARE IN LONDON. overall ratings 5/5",Amazing
"March 22, 2019",This was my first time here & will need to go back as its so massive there isnt time to see everything properly,"An enormous museum, rooms of exhibits."
"March 19, 2019","It was a Saturday afternoon, it was school holidays, most of London was crowded into this museum, had to fight my way around to see anything. Did not enjoy!!",Well worth a Visit 
"March 19, 2019","A very well organised set up, can be very busy with visiting school parties,however a very pleasant half day",Very busy
"December 11, 2018",Should have realised school holiday. In school half term DO NOT use South Kensington station. Use nearby Gloucester rd station instead only a min or two further to walk but well worth hassle of battling with horrendously overcrowded South Kensington,History come to life
"December 9, 2018","We specifically went there with the sole purpose of viewing the Mary Anning fossil.  Most of us read the book ""Remarkable Creatures"" by Tracy Chevalier.  There was an actress playing the part of Mary which added to the experience.  There was so much to see at this museum, we did not have the time to do this museum justice. Perhaps our next trip to London. ","Lines are terrible, the museum is fantastic"
"December 3, 2018","Mostly everything is in the title: Lines are terrible, the museum is fantastic. Try to go either early in the morning or after 2pm when the lines are not that long",Lots of fun
"December 3, 2018",We arrived 5 minutes before the doors open and there was a huge queue but when it got to 10am it moved really fast. I thought there would be a bag search and more security but there wasn’t. It’s donations & no charge for the museum so we put £5 in for about an hours visit. Lots to see and the ice skating/carousel made it feel nice and Christmassy ,Children and Adults love it
"December 3, 2018",Still one of the best things to do in London if you have a spare day.Amazing things to see and even if you have been before you always find something you may have missed previously.,Always great
"December 1, 2018",Called in when in the area. This has always been my favourite London museum and thankfully nothing has changed apart from the exhibitions. Great staff and always happy to help you.,Fun activity for the whole family
"November 28, 2018","We went there in a rainy day to escape the rain, but we had fun inside exploring all the sections of the museum, the building itself is historic and nice to see from the inside",Interesting Venue for reception
"November 28, 2018",Attended a conference reception in this hall. It is ancient venue that is cavernous for a large reception. ,A beautiful and fascinating museum
"November 26, 2018","I visited again this week and have done so for many years returning again and again. This time I decided to become a member and I am looking forward to visiting again, especially the special exhibitions.",Never too old to learn 
"November 25, 2018",Great time spent in stunning surroundings. There’s so much to see that you’re bound to miss something. Enjoy the exhibits and marvel at the building. Go early and use the side entrance if you can. The queue was huge when we left but it was a Saturday. ,Short time
"December 31, 2018",Just a quick visit as the young member in our group wanted to see where Paddington Bear came during the first film! Late on in the day as it was our last day in London but had time to look around downstairs & first floor. Should have come here earlier on in the day. Must try harder next time!,Busy but great
"December 31, 2018",There is so much interesting stuff to see here. Really you need to visit more than once to see everything properly. It was majorly busy at New Years but we managed to see what we wanted too. ,Victim of its own success
"December 30, 2018","The museum is great. But we couldn’t see any of it due to the massive crowds and queues everywhere. There is a long queue to get in, long queue for the cloakroom, long queue for the toilets, long queues for the exhibits. Then when you are in an exhibit, there are so many people around that you can’t see any of it, and feel like you are in a massive washing machine of people. We managed an hour before giving up, then had to wait for ages to get the pushchair out of the cloakroom again.",AMAZING
"December 20, 2018","It is sad to see someone who complains about even dropping a donation, the place deserves it and then some.So inspiring, for everyone.",Exceptional museum!
"December 19, 2018",The (free) museum itself is spectacular to view. It’s an exceptional building with lots of interesting exhibitions. Ranging from mammals to the human body. Great for adults and kids. There was an ice skating rink outside the museum with a couple of food stalls. ,"So much to see, it's endless"
"December 17, 2018","Amazing building housing some fantastic exhibits. Our young ones got themselves a kids guide and wanted to make a bee line for the Dinosaurs. We entered via Exhibition Street and missed all the lines. The first stop was the cloak room which was good to have and at £2 a coat we were not disappointed.We took the opportunity to head through the volcanic globe to the earthquake simulation and volcano exhibit.We then started to make our way to the blue zone stopping where we could whilst our 5 year old pushed through to the dinosaurs. The birds are fantastic and a rare site many being extinct as were the mammals that we saw along the way.The Main Hall was great with the Blue Whale skeleton suspended above and other skeletons dotted around including a Mastodon.Andy's clock from Andy's prehistoric adventures was fantastic for the kids and they were so excited to have a picture with it. We finally made it to the Dinosaur exhibit and the robotic Trex is amazing and great showing, however it did scare the kids which made the rest of the Dinosaur exhibit a bit of a miss.Managed to get around the Blue Whale, Mammal and other sea creatures exhibit before the kids were over it and wanted out.Fair warning to all with young kids, bring snacks and be prepared to miss many exhibits wanting to come back on your own.Great opportunity and I recommend going on a school day and entering via Exhibition street",Fascinating place
"December 16, 2018","When in London this is a must whether you have small children teens or just adults.convinently located in South Kensington near the underground station and easily accessible. Free entry induce gift shops restaurant coffeyshops . Can easily spend all day looking at dinasour bones , human anatomy and much more. Can be quite busy during holidays.",So cool! 
"December 13, 2018","Love the fact the museum in London are free to visit. Makes for a crowded trip but everyone should be able to experience these incredible places. The exhibits were as impressive as the architecture of the building. The dinosaur exhibit was a bit hectic and busy. If you can spare the cash, the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibit is definitely worth the visit. ",Great for Kids and Adults
"December 12, 2018",Lots to see and do as well as admire the architecture.So much information and some interactive displays.Also well located and just a short walk from the Science Museum and the Victoria & Albert Museums.,Family trip 
"December 11, 2018",1st visit and thoroughly enjoyed it. Will return as so much to see.  Free to enter.  Easily accessed from the tube on the Piccadilly line. ,Not the best museum in London
"January 9, 2019","Was slightly disappointed with our visit to the Natural History Museum. Just not as good in comparison to the British Museum. And definitely don’t go on school holidays, what a nightmare. Way too busy.",Favorite place of my trip
"January 8, 2019","I loved the building from the outside, was very impressed of the inside and of everything I’ve seen there. My 8 years old daughter loved it too",Extraordinary
"January 8, 2019","We visited here on the second day of our three day trip to London in November.It is truly a marvellous structure, not unlike Hogwarts, giving what feels like a travel in time.The exhibits too are fantastic if a little dated in various areas.Make sure you get here early as when we was leaving the queue was exceptionally large, and be prepared for the Dinosaur exhibit to be heaving as this is the most popular attraction within the museum.",Everything I Expected
"January 6, 2019","The museum is wonderful! Reminds me of the movie ""Night at the museum"". Lots to look at and learn. I enjoyed the mixture of old and new things to view. I enjoyed the flow of the museum making it easy to navigate. If you like history, animals and beautiful architecture this is the Museum for you. Great for families or a fun day trip activities. Also a close walk to other major London Attractions.","Amazing collection, beautiful architecture, terrible crowds"
"January 6, 2019","The museum's architecture is as amazing as its collection and alone is worth the visit. However, the crowds are terrible. Thankfully, we arrived early - about 15 minutes before the museum opened - to line up and enjoy some parts of the museum before it was entirely overrun. The dinosaur exhibit was extremely popular, as expected, and is designed in a way that forces visitors to follow a path. Unfortunately, it was very congested and it was very challenging to appreciate and enjoy the exhibit. With that in mind, we were still able to visit most of the museum in about 2-2.5 hours. ",Perfect Family Free Option for London
"September 21, 2018","I was on my own and decided to do the museum. It was fascinating, free (but It’s good to make a donation). They have an extensive dinosaur exhibit and body exhibit. I didn’t get to rest but it looked great.  I would recommend for families. ",Really interesting
"September 21, 2018","This museum is  HUGE and if you want to see it all, you have to dedicate a whole day. We spent about 4 hrs and we did not see all of the museum. I really liked to volcanoes and earthquakes section since it was so interactive. ",A must see in London - combine with the Science museum (around the corner) for a great day out
"September 20, 2018","I grew up in the UK and drove past the Natural History Museum every day on my way to and from work... it wasn't until I moved to Asia and had kids that I came to appreciate it.I took my 7, 9 and 10-year-old kids back to London over the summer and did all the sights... without question, the Natual History Museum was by far the best, the staff were great, the displays engaging and my kids loved it. In that area, you also have London zoo (don't bother), the Science Museum (very good) and the V&A (also good).",Stunning 
"September 19, 2018","What an amazingly beautiful building. The exhibitions are tippy top quality. You should plan to stay for a few hours minimum, or a second day if you want to take it all in. There is a Restaurant/Cafe.",Brilliant musuem so much to see
"September 17, 2018","we had a really lovely day out here, highly recommend comfy shoes as theres lots of walking. Felt the dinosaur exhibit was a bit of a let down as compared to the New York Natural History museum they are displayed better so you can get better pictures and you can view from a high vantage pint whereas in London everything was on ground level and a lot of the time the volume of people made it difficult to see everything. Found the volcano and earthquakes exhibit really interesting especially where you can go on an earthquake simulator. The animal exhibit again is amazing with lots to see and learn. And particularly liked the precious gem section as well. There's a nice cafe where we stopped for cake with plenty of assortment plus the gift shop had lots of things to buy as souvenirs although not much choice of postcards.",Superb Day out . 
"September 12, 2018",Last came many years ago with my children .enjoyed it very much just as I remembered it .Be aware that the t rex is being maintained atm & is unavailable till end of September. The earthquake / volcano exhibition was our fave Please remember to leave a donation. ,Natural history museum 
"January 6, 2019","This is one of best museum I have ever been. This museum will sure teach you lots of things and knowledge. I recently visit to see blue whale skeleton. They always have new things in display and also exhibition of best photos and collections. I would like to go this museum whenever I can. The building architecture is amazing. If you have kids please take them, I am sure they will love it. ",A great place to study crowds & noise
"January 6, 2019","The collection is old but still fascinating. However, children running and screaming, grown-ups reading out-loud the descriptions or proclaiming whatever they see  is so cute, makes it hard to concentrate on the exhibits.  It is high time that museums start 'silent days'; days on which visitors only whisper.",Educational
"January 6, 2019",Great museum with wide variety of exhibits from volcanos and earthquakes to dinosaurs and whales and everything in between. A must visist place in london,Great free attraction
"January 3, 2019",A short queue but this free attraction has great exhibits for kids. Mine enjoyed the human body section where they learnt about cells and how the body works. Dinosaur section is a must see! Also they have Andy’s clock from Andy’s dinosaur adventures the tv show.,"Enchanting museum, great to motivate kids"
"January 1, 2019","The building is fantastic, makes you feel like you traveled a hundred years back. Bring your kids to arouse their interest in nature and museums!",Where do I start
"September 12, 2018",Living in the DC area we have a great natural history museum.  This one comes close to the local museum (maybe I am being a bit prejudice)  Great visit especially if you are traveling with children.,Beautiful Architecture 
"September 11, 2018","Another beautiful view of London we adore.most happiest place for kids,needed a month to explore this place.25 metre long skeleton of blue whale 🐋 is amazing.romanesque style architecture is mind blowing.worth visiting for the amazing permanent collection.",Awesome.
"September 11, 2018",The museum is incredible. We really liked the Dinosaur and the Mammal sections but the Human Body section was also really good. It's better to go there early since it gets really busy around noon and there are large amounts of people in the more popular exhibits such as the animatronic T-Rex.,It's worth a visit
"September 9, 2018","We were highly recommended by our friends to visit this Museum when we were in the UK for a short trip. So we did and the big blue whale skeleton had caught our attention when we entered into the building. There's a lot to see and in fact a lot to learn. After the visited, we realized how little that we know about the nature creation. Highly recommend for everyone during your stay in London.",Excellent and Family Friendly Museum
"October 23, 2018","Great museum that has something for everyone - stuff to touch and a playroom for children/toddlers, gorgeous gems, and a moving dinosaur.  Plus, an outdoor area that is refreshing in the concrete jungle of London.",Amazing
"October 22, 2018","Great place to visit with the kids, been twice now and loved it both times. Incredible building with lots to see and do. Brilliant.",Grand place
"October 19, 2018",Although very busy we loved our time there. The cafe was reasonable with friendly staff. The exhibitions are truly historically impressive and important. Both my younger son and teenager found the place mesmerising. The entrance is free but donations are requested which we liked. ,School Groups
"October 19, 2018",The Natural History Museum was the last place I visited in London prior to leaving for Heathrow. It was a Friday so I didn’t think that they would be that busy but I forgot about the school groups. They were everyone and had no supervision. Also the museum was lacking staff to ask questions throughout the museum but had about ten people working the shop. I was limited on time so I visited two areas: the treasures and the dinosaurs. The treasure were very interesting and some of the most important  items in the museum. The dinosaurs was more geared towards children but they had some nice skeletons. Worth some time but the crowds are huge. Plus it is free. ,Spectacular - many wonderful displays
"October 18, 2018","Both inside and outside, this is a spectacular building.  It is vast, and very popular.  So you might want to make some plans ahead of time.While it is free to get in there are some displays that have a charge,",Good museum
"October 14, 2018","Large museum; with great exhibitions, however very crowded, and the lunch menu was average. Probably better on weekdays than rainy weekend.",Go and see the big whale fossil
"October 10, 2018",The whale fossil hanging from the ceiling of the hall is huge.  experience the earthquake in Kobe supermarket - it was fun.  Free admission - excellent place for primary school kids.,Great day
"October 8, 2018","Fantastic museum with endless models, exhibits and displays of notable natural history discoveries and knowledge.Loads of stuff to see and do, especially for kids. The cavernous mineral hall is exceptional, as is the section of trunk from the giant Sequoia tree.Plan to spend several hours looking round.",Kids love it
"October 8, 2018","The Natural History Museum is a must on a visit to London and kids of all ages love it, though mostly for the dinosaurs and whales. It is easily accessible, has multiple cafes that are family friendly and reasonably priced. A great place to visit if it is raining and you are up for a wander. Entry is free although a donation is requested.",So much fjn
"October 8, 2018",For a first time visiter (in my 20s) I can honestly say that I enjoyed myself tremendously. We were there for roughly two and a half hours and looked through maybe half of the exhibits. There was a wide range that everyone enjoyed. ,Awesome museum
"August 7, 2019",First museum we visited in London an it was such a great experience. The queue was long but passed quickly and the exhibits inside were amazing to see ,Simply the best
"August 7, 2019","You can visit many places in London, however when you step outside the underground and you see this majestic building, you immediately feel amused! A must to see in the Capital!",Well presented in all areas. Earthquake extremely well done
"August 7, 2019",It is hard to pinpoint any particular area to review. All of the exhibits well documented and clearly labelled to read. Dinosaurs and the Earthquake exhibit very absorbing. Unfortunately all exhibits were overcrowded so sometimes hard to concentrate with pushy schoolkids and other tourists.   ,Great place for kids and learning about the world
"August 7, 2019","This museum is perfect for those who love biology, animals, and earth sciences. They have exhibits on dinosaurs, animals, volcanoes, and much more. It's a great place for kids and parents but there is a lot to read so be prepared to learn.",pay a visit!
"August 7, 2019","very good museum, went with my kids and they were fascinated by so many things to see and learnworth going",Just excellent 
"August 7, 2019","If you are thoroughly interested in palaeontology, just a great museum. The nature is jaw dropping, amazing.","An old favourite, but the crowds are phenomenal"
"August 7, 2019","Seriously, I love the Natural History Museum. It’s a must do on my London visits. This time I was lucky enough to go to the ‘Museum of the Moon’ which was amazing. However, my only disappointment was the crowds. So so so many people. Often viewing was at a shuffle. Try and avoid the busy times... if there is such a thing. ",Amazing Architecure
"August 7, 2019","A free museum catered to families but suitable for everyone of all ages. Different exhibits for different areas of interested as well as several restaurant and cafes with reasonably priced items. Huge whale skeleton and architecture of the building make great photo ops. The only fault I had was there was only one entrance and exit, this made it difficult to leave and enter due to large amount of people. ",Great fun
"August 7, 2019","Loads of interesting things inside. I love the museum of the moon and the dinosaur sections. There are souvenir shops and cafes inside so you can always have something to eat if you fancy having one. Lay-out seemed a bit confusing, but managed to see all the sections eventually. Too many people walking around, so worth getting their early and take the queue to get in.",Go on a quiet day
"August 7, 2019",We arrived early and were amongst the first in and for about 30 mins it was fine but after that it was simply too busy to see or enjoy most of the exhibits. I would go back on a quiet day if there's such a thing. ,One of London’s top attractions 
"August 24, 2018","It has a very large collection covering everything from geological samples to human reproduction. It’s most famous for the dinosaurs and the full size blue whale.Visitors will probably spend a full day there. It has some nice cafes for lunch and has a “picnic area” for visitors who bring a packed lunch.Because it’s a great attraction, it does get very busy.It’s free to enter but the suggested donation is £5 and some exhibitions cost extra.",Too busy
"August 23, 2018",This is a great museum and whilst we got there early it was too busy. The dinosaur section in particular was manic and it was difficult to spend time reading any of the information. To be fair it’s free and this is similar to many others. If position the only advice I could give is to avoid peak times but do go ,A must for families with children
"August 23, 2018",We had a great time in the museum . The children enjoyed many interesting displays especially the dinosaurs. We had limited time so a full day is recommend . The resturant was very nice with children menue and good vegetarian options.,Amazing and free!
"August 22, 2018",We got lucky and didn’t have to queue. 12 noon Tuesday. Just fascinating and it’s all free! Our 6 year old loved the earthquakes and dinosaur sections. Was busy but not unbearably so and very well organised. ,Fantastic
"August 20, 2018",You could spend all day in here! Great for kids of all ages. The human body section is now looking very dated compared to the rest but still worth a visit. ,Educational and fascinating and for free.
"August 18, 2018","The building is really exceptional, its what I imagine Hogwarts to look like, and the displays are really exceptional.",For everyone
"August 16, 2018","A nice museum with a lot of information and exhibits. Really nice to walk through looking a bit here or there, but also a place where you can spend a lot of time and learn new things. And they have a mechanical T-rex... Who doesn't love a mechanical T-rex!? ",Wish I didn’t have to leave
"August 16, 2018",This museum rocks I spent an entire day there and didn’t want to leave! Loved it and all the exhibits. I’ve akways been a fan of dinosaurs since I was a child and their exhibits do not disappoint at all.,GO
"August 13, 2018","if you love the world, GO !    and even if you don't !This place is unique, I used to sit and read in the beautiful ground of it, under the imposing arches, feeling other times. loving the bricks. totally recommended",Fascinating for Children
"August 12, 2018",The many exhibits in the Natural History Museum are fascinating for children...especially the dinosaurs. Very educational and fun for all ages,Busy but brilliant first visit 
"August 29, 2018",Super museum and well worth a visit. Our kids aged 8 & 6 loved it. Favourite for us was mammal section. ,Don’t get me started on the architecture
"August 28, 2018",I spent as much time in awe of the glorious architecture as I did the very clever dinosaur exhibit.  Walk with your eyes wide to take it all in...,WOW
"August 28, 2018","From the minute you walk in, and you see the massive whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling, it takes your breath away. You feel like you are in some sort of Harry Potter building. The dinosaur display is incredible. To be 100% honest, every time we walked around a corner there was a display that made us feel like kids in a candy shop, followed by a ""wow, this is awesome"". I would definitely recommend a visit here. Its incredible.   ",Fascinating!
"August 27, 2018","A really interesting museum which is big enough to keep you busy for hours! Great for individuals and families with children of all ages. Can be a little confusing to find your way around, but if you’re visiting London as a tourist then you shouldn’t miss this!","Go for the animals, stay for the architecture!"
"August 27, 2018","The museum collection is very nice, including robotic dinosaurs, so great place for kids of all ages.  But if you're an architecture fan, you must go here! Throughout the building are beautiful original stained glass windows, millwork and tiles.  I'd love to take a tour just for that! ",Fantastic museum for the whole family
"August 26, 2018","Absolutely loved this museum, great interactive exhibits. My 7 year old son loved the dinosaur exhibit and the Kobe earthquake demonstration. This museum is spectacular, we spend about 3 hours here and had a good whirlwind tour. I think you could easily spend a lot more time here and the next time we’re in London we’ll be back. ","Amazing place, a lot to see"
"August 25, 2018",You sure need more than one day to really explore everything that this museum has to offer. Huge with lots of interesting things for all ages,What a building
"August 25, 2018",Needed a little more time to explore but had a wonderful time. The building is amazing. A walk through the garden is a nice break from the crowds. ,You can spend hours here
"August 25, 2018",Many remarkable painting from many classic artists and its free to enter. You can spend hours in here so be prepared to get exhausted. ,Fabulous British treasure
"August 25, 2018","Absolutely fabulous free indoor activity in London. They ask for a small donation on entry (not compulsory) and it’s well worth giving. Stunningly beautiful building and a fabulous display of so many interesting exhibits. Interaction for little ones to keep them interested too. Staff very helpful and friendly, and although we visited at a busy time, we could still see what we wanted too. Only negatives were it’s difficult to find the public toilets and there are not enough. Also not enough healthy snacks for sale in the restaurant/cafe. Definitely worth a visit, whatever your age. ",Dino Snores - Excellent
"August 6, 2018","Booked Dino Snores for my two grandsons. They were so excited about having a night in a museum, particularly as this is their favourite one.  We were directed by the staff to the beautiful Hintze Hall where we selected a sleeping spot in the company of the great Charles Darwin statue and of course the Blue Whale skeleton. Then the fun began.It was a truly amazing event and the kids and adults were enthralled at the displays and talks given by experts in the fields of science, nature and animals.  I just loved the children's faces as they turned the corner in the torchlit gallery to be confronted by a life-sized roaring Tyrannosaurus Rex,  made me jump too.This is something the kids will remember all their lives and they learnt an awful lot as did we adults.  Won't say too much about the event as it can spoil the fun if you know too much, but just to say I felt it was worth every penny.On a practical note the sleeping mats are very thin so if you need more comfort take an extra mat and small pillow, as they suggest in the notes.  Fans were running all night so it was not too hot. Plenty of tap water and toilet facilities.  Your own food was taken in the eating area at a set time in the evening. Very light and simple breakfast was provided with plenty of coffee, tea and juice. You need comfy clothes that you can sleep in, a torch, a camera and plenty of refillable water bottles.The staff were friendly, welcoming, enthusiastic and inspiring and the whole event was very well organised from start to finish. Top marks from me.",Another great London museum
"August 5, 2018","The natural history museum is fantastic. It has something for everyone to enjoy. You could spend hours here if not days and not see everything in one visit. We find it better to visit a few times, taking a few sections at a time to see, that way you fully appreciate all that is on display. Anyone interested in natural history will love the museum. Free entry apart from certain exhibits. Disabled access. Nice cafe. ",Where history makes sense
"August 5, 2018",Simply the best place to learn about our planets past. Thoroughly informative and highly educational,Excellent 
"August 3, 2018",Very nice museum with lots of nice things to see. I would say that this is as good as the one in Washington DC ,"Packed in like sardines, some useful info"
"August 2, 2018","Let me begin by stating that museums in the UK are mostly free for the public. And this is a great thing. But recently visited the Natural History museum after previously going a few years back and there have been some improvements and some disappointments. One main issue was air conditioning. Temperatures were very uncomfortable in some areas. Industrial fans just shifted the warm air around. Admittedly me and my partner went through the school holidays so it was bound to be busy. We expected this and was prepared. But what we were not prepared for, was the funneling of people (almost like cattle) through the dinosaur section. We couldn't read any of the information as there were so many people packed in like sardines that you couldn't stop! There were too many people crammed into the tiny corridor like pathway which is supposed to lead you around the dinosaur section. I couldn't wait to get out. It was a shame. What was interesting was finding out their dinosaur ""gift shop"" was almost if not bigger than the entire dinosaur section. I think we know what the museum is trying to do here. Disney springs to mind. The human biology section was good although not updated. it was a little more spaced out so we spent a bit longer in this section. Finally learning things! The animal section with the huge blue whale was again good but nothing updated. We decided to head outside for some air and have a quick look at their ""garden"". This area is to promote biodiversity. It was nice to grab some air but this area was far from a garden. It was overgrown, messy, full of weeds....nothing like the picture of what it was mean't to look like. The pond was nice though, lots of dragonflys, ladybirds and a few others. We then made our way to the red zone, by passing yet another gift shop and 2 cafes. We stopped for some food. The price was reasonable (About £12 each) for some hot food and a drink.The red zone.This was an area where the museum got it right. Plenty of information about human evolution, lots of exhibits. The earthquake zone again, lots of information plus the earthquake ""demonstration"" was great. We spent most of our time here as there was lots to take in. Overall, not the best experience. I'd have to say I've visited much better museums around the world and this is supposed to be London, one of the best cities in the world and this is all we have to offer? The British Museum wins this time. Areas to improve:Garden - Make it a garden. Not a wasteland.Air con - Needed in summer.Open up the dino section - Seriously thought this could be a fire hazard. Stop trying to sell things and just be a museum.Perhaps have a section for Live animals? Insects would be great as would fish. A living reef? Discuss climate issues? How these affect living reefs? 3/5","Beautiful Space, dated exhibits"
"August 2, 2018","The Natural History Museum building is simply amazing. And worth the visit. It took us two tries to get in—the first time we intended to go was a rainy Sunday and it was so mobbed that we didn’t wait to go in. We came back on a sunny Tuesday and we were at least able to get in without a very long wait. As mentioned, the architecture in the building is spectacular but the exhibits are showing their age. ",Awe Inspiring
"July 31, 2018","There is not enough time in the day to see this place in one sitting. If you enjoy architecture, this place will have your jaw drop. My little loves dinosaurs and she was able to see so many things that we have not been able to find here in the states. There is something for everyone. With so many different floors and exhibits, it is fantastic for everyone. One of our favorite parts was the butterfly exhibit. The people who work/volunteer there will spend so much time with you helping you enjoy and learn more about the exhibits, and you will be able to see the entire life cycle of a butterfly up close.The cafe there is a bit pricey, so do not be surprised if you choose to have a meal there that it will be a little more on the expensive side in comparison to eating out in town. If you have an inquisitive child, or are an inquisitive child at heart, this is definitely a place to go.",Amazing museum but avoid the T Rex Grill restaurant at all costs
"July 24, 2018","Hugely overpriced, poor quality food. Bad service, rude staff who expect a tip for rubbish work. Cold food which sat on the pass for 20 minutes and went rubbery. Absolute rip off. Take picnic or go to a local cafe or outlet near the station. Or even chew a guidebook ... it would be tastier for same price.",Interesting museum!
"July 24, 2018","The museum itself is huge, and got a little bit tiring in this heat, but overall it was fun! The crowds were also a bit too much, but we went in the afternoon so the queue was not bad. I would definitely recommend for groups!",Fantastic place to while away several hours or even days.....
"July 23, 2018","It began by visiting the temporary Butterfly House, adjacent to the main building.  After a brief spell in there, where we were both very impressed by the knowledgeable staff and their passion for the Lepidoptera, we moved into the Museum itself.No matter how many times you visit, the first glimpse in the main hall is just spine tingling.We spent over 4 hours walking around, enjoying the exhibits, of special mention would be the Dinosaurs, not just a collection of dead bones,  ut faithfully recreated animatronic interpretations of a few of them, made the kids gasp in awe.A quick Coffee and we were about to leave when I gentleman came in and over the din of the people enjoying Coffee, Soda etc, he announced there was to be a brief lecture in theatre.The subject was “Lepidoptera of Madagascar”, presented by a Mr Lee.  Now I have been interested in Lepidoptera for at least 50 years, so this appealed and we headed out to locate the said theatre.It was the Attenborough Theatre and the lecture was part of an ongoing “Nature Live”, series of talks.  It’s a very intimate setting with fewer than 75 seats.  Mr Lee, did a great job, holding the attention of small children and people like myself enthralled.It only lasted 30 minutes or so but afterwards I took the time to speak to and to thank Mr Lee, saying that if only one person in that audience had learned a new appreciation of Moths and Butterflies, it would be fantastic.There is no cost to enter the Museum, it is free..  However, if like me, you enjoyed the visit, please leave a donation, no matter how small, to keep this wonderful place open for our Children’s, Children’s Children........",Simply astounding 
"July 15, 2018","I have visited the museum of natural history around 7 times and I make it a must to visit it again every time I'm in London to catch up on recent discoveries and displays. My all time favourite section is the dinosaurs and this museum is constantly up to date with its newsletters, website, etc. It caters for families with young children as well as the disabled and most displays and guides have different languages to avoid there being a language barrier. I have not had not one problem during my visits. Of course seasons effect how busy and packed it gets but it is still definitely worth the visit. ",Fun family day
"July 15, 2018","We were on vacation and knew we wanted to visit NHM because of the dinosaurs and butterfly exhibit.It was a hit! Our 3 year old twin girls loved the butterflies and Dinosaurs! The T-Rex was incredible, haven’t seen anything like that before.Other areas that were a hit with the kids was the escalator that goes up into what looks like earth and the earthquake shake.I think NHM will have something for everyone. We didn’t see everything just the areas of interest for our family.The building is beautiful. It’s definitely worth a visit for all ages and it’s free :)))))",Nice museum
"July 15, 2018","Lots of dinosaur, animal exhibits. Moving dinosaur models are pretty cool. Exhibits on humans, memory, vision etc are pretty cool as well. Beautiful exterior.close to Science museum and V&A museum.Free entry but can donate to museum if you wish",Lots of fun 
"July 14, 2018",Great fun and wide variety of exhibits to suit all ages and interests. One of the many museums which offer a free entry. Great gift shop available. ,Dinosnores
"July 13, 2018","What appeared to be a fun ‘big kid’ experience turned out to be a rushed, school trip throw back of an evening. The museum is fantastic and the building itself is striking, however the management of the dinosnores event was poor. The food is expensive and poor in quality which was a shame and the itinerary is a bit lacking in the execution. Pop up stalls that focus on ticking the box rather than offering something of value. The real challenge is security, literally. It’s obvious that they don’t like the event and it’s an inconvenience to have people around after hours, I over heard a number of conversations as I moved around where security guards were complaining and saying the guests were ‘taking the piss’ and they were generally rude. I’m not usually thin skinned so it wouldn’t have bothered me but the movie marathon they run all night if you can’t sleep was pointless as security goaded you back from anywhere other than the main hall where guests are expected to sleep, again a real shame. Could have been great but I wouldn’t recommend this in view of what’s on offer elsewhere in London.",Very informative
"July 13, 2018","Free entrance,you can contribute if you like for maintenance .Beautiful building, very informative for all age group",Excellent free museum to view with kids
"July 12, 2018",We had to see this museum after watching Paddington Bear. It is just as cool as the movie showed with room after grand room of amazing stuffed animals. The architecture is amazing and best of all it is free. What is not to love? ,Beautiful Museum 
"July 12, 2018","It has been years since I was a kid and visited here with school.What a beautiful, well kept museum. Full of amazing artefacts, dinosaurs, birds etc.No doubt we will be back when the boy is slightly older.Considering how busy it was it wasn’t chaotic.Very pleasant stroll around.",“A cathedral to nature”
"July 12, 2018","The building itself is so extraordinarily beautiful that it is worth a visit even if you have no interest in animals or plants. I was last here at least 10 years ago and was interested to see what had changed. I have to admit that Dippy the Diplodocus made a more dramatic impact in the entrance hall than the whale that has replaced him. The exhibits in the alcoves around it were all new and interesting. My daughter and I visited the marine biology section where I noticed some exhibits had been “temporarily removed” in 2014! It seems a shame to leave gaps for that long when the museum has so many exhibits in storage that are never displayed. The mammals section, to be honest, needed a good dusting and was quite dated looking. I hope visitors are paying the £5 requested donation (as we did) and that the slight air of neglect I observed is not for lack of funds. ",Just Amazing!
"July 11, 2018","Visited with 2 children age 9 & 7- travelled from Ireland for a few days to London.....This was by far the highlight of our trip. First day we went, was on a Tuesday in the first week in June @ 1pm - no queues. Second day we went was the next Saturday (yes we went twice because we loved it so much) @ 10am - big queues but seemingly queues get even bigger during school summer holidays. Building itself is beautiful & worth seeing inside. Range of skeletal animals, bug species and nature artefacts are huge. The Dinosaur section is class-don’t miss that.   Plant section is v interesting and laid out so well- children were never board. Talks for children take place in different areas at different times- we didn’t attend any due to time constraints but sound v good. Don’t miss the blue whale! Give yourself a full day to go and explore - it takes a while to see everything. Lots of toilets on-site and a lovely restaurant . Go early in morn and mid-week to avoid queues. I will be visiting again soon - such a nice day out! ",Great way to spend time in London and it is free!
"June 28, 2018",One can spend a full day here easily or just few hours and select those parts of museum that interest you. Went mainly to see the dinosaur fossils but ended up browsing around for three hours. The museum is also free to enter and there is donation possibility if you want to pay for your visit. Definitely worth seeing in London ,Fun Museum to Visit
"June 28, 2018","I definitely recommend this for families with small children because it is quite the layout of dinosaur bones and interesting animal life. Though, visiting it with my grandmother, we found it a pleasant stop but not an ""must-see"" though the architecture of the museum is quite stunning. ",Excellence as expected!
"June 28, 2018","Have visited this museum more than once in the past, but remains a favourite. Things have changed quite a bit since my last visit (1987) but not the value and enjoyment derived from an excellent exhibition of what was. The Brits just know how to get it right. Thank you ! ",She sells seashells by the seashore
"June 27, 2018","I was excited to  visit the Natural History Museum specifically to see the Mary Anning fossils in the paleontology hall. I wasn't disappointed, by the exhibit or by the museum in it's entirety.This museum is one of the triumvirate of the British museums, the BM, the British Library, and the Natural History Museum.See them all if you have the chance.",Great experience!
"June 27, 2018",The most beautiful Naturel History Museum I' ve ever seen! Great exhibition on dinosaurs and the best of all the section devoted to volcanoes! It's a great museum for children: they can do a lot of experiments. ,Great stuff
"June 25, 2018","Lots of things I always wanted to see like the Apple 1, and the British watch makers. Just class, pure class",The Greatest Museum
"June 25, 2018","The building which houses the collection is remarkable in itself, be sure to look at the walls and ceiling of the main hall. The story of life is played out in intricate masonry. Where to start, the museum holds an absolutely mind boggling amount of artifacts. The collection covers the complete timeline of the earth, from its early days, fossils record, dinosaurs, ancient Egypt, man in space...you name it they have it. The displays are well pitched for all ages, children will particularly love the dinosaurs!Best of all and unlike most other places worldwide, museums and galleries are free to visit in the United Kingdom! So come and enjoy and learn! ",Always 5 stars
"June 23, 2018","One of several re-visits whilst in London. every time there is new and fascinating to explore.  It can be crowded, so go early if you prefer less crowds",Fantastic 
"June 23, 2018",Have not been in a few years . Visited with my son who is studying zoology and my daughter . Fantastic exhibits very well though out and educational. This is a must for any visitor to London. ,Favorite Museum with Kids
"June 21, 2018",Such a great day out with kids! Cant miss the dinosaurs. The restaurant is perfect for lunch and tea.,Nice place
"May 21, 2018",Natural history museums aren't my favorite type of museums by this one was very nice. Its size isnt as overwhelming as some of the museums in the area. Lots of kids. Bring patience,"Gorgeous building, so-so exhibits"
"May 11, 2018","We planned a mid-week visit, but were unaware that the day was a bank holiday, so it was really crowded. If you go, you must be very tolerant of parents of young children. The dinosaur exhibit appears to have undergone a fairly recent re-do, but traffic control is not ideal in the area, and most of the information placards still refer to dinosaurs as reptiles. It is also a challenge to match up the exhibit with its identifying information.Most surprising and disappointing was the condition of a great deal of the mammal exhibits. These are housed in an area where there is a great deal of natural light. The specimens are very, very faded and look quite shabby. An explanatory plaque states that the museum does not want to replace the specimens, because of the endangered status of many of the animals. While commendable, it would make for a better exhibit if they attempted some sort of restoration with the specimens they have on display. The coloration on the giant panda and the cheetah are barely discernible. The building itself is gorgeous, and worth a look around even if you decide to skip the exhibits, but if you are accustomed to the natural history museums in New York, Washington DC, and Chicago, this one might be a bit of a letdown.",Go early and avoid weekends!
"May 11, 2018",One of the best museums that I have been to in a long time. The photography exhibit is a small charge but the entry to the museum is free. The butterfly exhibit is going on until summer of 2018 too.,Best collection of bones in the world!
"May 9, 2018","I'm pretty sure that my dog has dreams that are very similar to the contents of this museum :DIt is absolutely amazing to see all these species, all so different in one place. it's kind of humbling really. Brilliant place for Kids and Grown ups!",A Huge Museum With Items Collected From All Over The World
"May 8, 2018",This museum is much larger then the ones that I have seen in the US. They have huge sections each with it's own exhibits. My favorite exhibit was the mineral exhibit. The room was larger then some museums. I also paid extra to visit the Wildlife Photography exhibit. It was outstanding. If you like photography then you will love this exhibit. Overall this museum has a lot to see and it will take you the better part of a day to see it all. This place is worth a visit. Young and old will be amazed.,"Way too busy, and the dust!"
"May 8, 2018","Sure, it is sort of blasphemous to give the NHM such a low rating. It is such a marvelous building, awe inspiring. But let’s be fair: many of the displays are outdated, the interactive ones didn’t work half the time. You walk around cramped corridors. And look at the amount of dust on the displays! Especially the blue zone (have a look from above at the whale)...!there is a interesting simulated disaster zone at the Earth gallery, but with so many people cramped in the restaurant at ground floor level, and all the litter lying around just there, they created a non-simulated disaster zone right there.",Margboyle
"May 3, 2018",I was there last wk it was a fantastic place to visit so much to see and would recommend this to everyone ,Beautiful but crowded
"May 1, 2018","I made the mistake of going a rainy Saturday and it was quite packed! The museum itself is beautiful, I really liked the idea of touching most things and interactive features! But make sure you go on a weekday if you don’t like kids running everywhere",So much to see!
"April 30, 2018",We saw a few exhibits but just a few.  We didn’t allow enough time.  The volcano exhibit was most informative!,You will see pictures here you didn’t know you knew!
"April 29, 2018",Fantastic gallery to see some of the world most famous art within touching distance and for free. From the life size horse painting by Stubbs to Turners Haywain and Monets water lilies,Must visit!!!!
"April 3, 2018","when in london with family, nhm definitely is one of the things to do.one should try and find atleast 3 hours on any day , slightly more on weekends i suggest.even as adults we enjoyed the place a lot, dinosaur at the entrance is awesome view.Kids above 5 would love it i bet and then stuff upstairs like how volcano erupts/ earth plating/ earthquake room all is nice learning experience and guess what is free of charge !!!don’t miss it ",Brilliant visit
"April 2, 2018",The natural history museum never disappoints. It’s free to visit with the option of giving a contribution. We visited after lunch during the Easter holidays and we were only queuing for around 10 minutes. It has loads to see and do and our daughters aged 7 and 3 absolutely loved it. It clean and well laid out. We particularly enjoyed the dinosaur section.  ,A great day out with family and friends
"April 1, 2018", Visited NHM on 1st April and i was absolutely pleased from start to end. Once we got to the museum we had to wait in a queue which was long but was moving at a steady pace. Took us around 20mins to get in but was definitely worth the wait. Staff were great and attentive. Knew all the answers to questions we were throwing at them and did there absolute best to help us. The museum itself is an awesome experience for any one who is any age. Tonnes of knowledge to indulge in and a lot to see.We spent 2 hours here and still didnt finish some parts of the museum. Definitely will return to complete the tour.,Long visit
"March 31, 2018",We was here at easter weekend And there was a lot of other people. Exhibition was good but just good ... free entrance.,"Popular, free entry"
"March 28, 2018","Visited on a weekend where there is a controlled queue entering into the museum due to large crowds. However, it was well controlled and moved relatively fast. Free entry to the permanent exhibits but all visitors are encouraged to donate. Great and engaging displays. Will recommend to all types of travellers including families. ",Remembering childhood
"March 28, 2018","Although a bit dusty, it's always good to remember one of the icons of my childhood.And it remains one of the greatest natural history museums of the world",Amazing museum !
"March 27, 2018",A must go to in London ! Despite the crowd we were able to see at our pace what we liked most ! An app is available to plan your visit before if needed !,"Honestly, it use to be so much better....."
"March 27, 2018","I will say that a majority of reviews on here are visitors to London or foreign tourists?? (total assumption). The reason I say this is that I have seen this Museum turn from one of the worlds best into something resembling an after thought. My first visit was over 30 years ago and numerous times up until recently and today what I saw was nothing like what it once was, the obvious attraction here is the Dinosaurs, sadly the exhibition here you are cattle pen trough the area and it is just absurd (Why such a small area to view from??), there use to be copious amounts of display cases from the moment you walked through the door into the main hall but they seem to have been replaced with tall boards with TV's mounted in this ""new style"" area off from the main hall on the left and since the crowds in this tiny narrow arrangement are constantly moving you just end up being pushed through and before you know it you have not seen much and you are at the exit, you can forget taking decent photos as the area is just so over crowded.The other thing to note is the queue to get in which I see others have mentioned, I remember just being able to walk up the big main stairs into the museum and away you go, whilst I see the need for security do they really need to let small children stand for ages outside to gain entry via a almost airport style security cordon?. All in I was really disappointed in the museum to what it use to be, I have even in the past had my own Meteorites authenticated here by simply walking in and asking to speak with a specialist which they where always happy to do, I very much doubt would be entertained these days??.The building is obviously beautiful and if you have small children under 10 they may find something here worth a look but honestly I will not be back.. I know this seems to go totally against what most of the reviews say but when you look at something like the British museum and the shear volume of artifacts and areas to view which are substantial I have to ask just what has happened to the exhibits in the Natural history museum?, why is the cattle pen area needed to view what is is obviously a main crowd pull?...The only saving grace was it is still free with the strong point of sale being a £5 donation, had I of put in £20 as would be the cost at most museums I would not have been happy..Only advice I could give is try to avoid peak times and school holidays, have a plan in place if you have little ones as the wait to get to the security area can be very long..",Awesome
"March 20, 2018",This place is great. We spent a morning here on a chilly Sunday and loved it. The dinosaurs are amaxing and little kids would love it. The architecture is inspiring and the vibe positive.,Whales: Beneath the Surface
"March 19, 2018",Went for the evening with friends and it was really nice. Mostly adults and you could have a drink of beer/wine to take with you. After the exhibition you had access to all of the Museum which was so much better than queuing to get in on a weekend or a busy bank holiday. I wish I had gone in the evening before. I will definitely go again and recommend to everyone.,Girlie 50th Birthday Celebrations!
"February 2, 2018",We did not have long to stop here so we all chose one thing we wanted to do and did that. Could spend all day here and not see everything.  It is such an amazing place to go and free too (donations accepted).  ,Fun for all the family
"January 27, 2018",We have visited many times and have always seen something different! Whatever ages of your party there is something for all!,Well laid out 
"January 26, 2018","Very well laid out, interesting, interactive and enjoyable. Dinosaurs section particularly interesting. Only negative some of the interactve screens not working.",School trip
"January 24, 2018",Topic on Darwin. Very educational talks and he even had a teacher getting involved in the tours. It’s a very big museum so seeing it all in one day willBe very exhausting so try to plan out the day,Very impressive
"January 24, 2018","This museum is huge with so much to see, all of it impressive. Give yourself at least three hours if you want to see it all. ",A Week's Worth of Wonders
"January 23, 2018",We spent two consecutive days at the Natural History Museum and still were not able to see it all.  Two hours in the rocks and minerals gallery could have been a whole day if we had the time.  The gemstone collection is breathtaking.  Take in the architectural details of the building itself.  A highlight of our time in London,Simply my favourite building on Earth
"January 23, 2018","I love the Natural History Museum. We try and visit as often as possible. It's the most gorgeous building, I love how the animal carvings match the content of the building itself. The new whale skeleton is interesting although not quite an impactful as the old dinosaur model in the main hintze hall. Beware! Its always incredibly busy at the weekend, so you better to go during the week.",Good Value if you make a donation
"January 22, 2018","This is a classic museum born of the pride and entrepreneurship of the Victorian era, housed in a stunning building. Much has been done to make the museum modern and bring it into the digital age but the classic exhibits still grab the attention of visitors young and old.The staff are wonderfully knowledgeable and great presenters not to be missed.",The highlight of any trip to London
"January 22, 2018",Always visit the Natural History Museum when we are in London as we love the exhibits and the building with all the tiny animal sculptures and also seeing Darwin sitting there on the stairs looking thoughtful while hundreds of noisy children bustle past him.  ,Great place to lose yourself in time and space
"January 13, 2018",Brilliant museum!!  Download the free app on the way in and the go through an incredible entryway and just have fun!! Even the architecture of the building is first rate and it is easy to navigate and just brilliantly put together.  I had my 12 year old and he was just enthralled from start to finish.  More complete fossils than we had ever seen and displayed well!  The gems and rocks were fascinating and I am generally left cold by rocks.,Night at the museum personified!!!
"January 13, 2018",This museum is really quite impressive with its various exhibits. Was surprised that they did not capitalize on the movie since it was shot here. It's an amazing  place to spend several hours or even a day with all of the interactive exhibits. And it's FREE!!!,Interactive and informative
"January 12, 2018",It will be good to go early in the morning and dedicate the entire day to visit the museum. A good place to learn!,Excellent 
"January 11, 2018",This museum is perfect ! I love it and also it is a incredible idea to go there with children the place is a dream ! Lovely ! ,Incredible number of things yo see
"January 9, 2018",This museum is really interactive and fun. We visited the Dinosaur area and were really impressed wth the automation and path through this area with lots of explanations and a few surprises!  Each if my family was able to find something of interest and this was just a small part of the museum. The architecture of the building itself is also stunning. I will definitely go back!,Fab museum 
"January 7, 2018","We visited the Natural history museum today it was our second trip. As usual the dinosaur and fossil exhibits were my sons favourite. However we discovered a fab area in the basement of the green zone beneath the main shop which was a discovery area. This areas allowed everyone to hold, examine and research bones, and fossils all with fab microscopes, reference books and research kits. My son who is 10 loved it as did all the children. Great staff on hand also to explain how to use the equipment. Next door is a really good picnic area where you can buy our eat your own food ( a lot cheaper than using the cafes!).Also we always find it is best to use the Cromwell room entrance to Avoid the main Queue's. ",Fun day out
"January 6, 2018",Fun day out for all of the family. So much to see & do. Exhibitions change but always worth the trip. You will probably have to queue to get in but the queue moves quickly. Great for all ages,Favourite museum in London 
"January 5, 2018","One of the best museums in London, loved the entrance hall and the Dino section is incredible, also the animals part we enjoyed been there many many times . Can get really busy over the weekends and kids holidays. ",Another great historic place to visit... and another one that's free!
"December 28, 2017",This place is either a short bus or tube ride if you are centrally located.  You can easily spend a day here looking at all the exhibits.  If you like history... you will love this place and it is well worth a visit,Huge museum
"December 28, 2017","A must visit place in London. The entrance is free and they have many categories in separate halls. Outside the museum, there is a ski area in winter which is very nice. You need to pay for the ski.",Amazing... one of the best museums I have ever been! And free!!!
"December 26, 2017","Simply A M A Z I N G! One of the best museums I have ever been and for sure one of the best museums in the world. Please, go!!! Don't hesitate also to make a donation, the place is free and you can totally go without paying but once you're there and see how amazing it is your heart will tell you to do right and make a donation, if you can't that's no matter, you still can go freely and enjoy everything but the important thing is YOU MUST GO!",Had a good time here
"December 5, 2017",I haven't been to a natural history museum in a while . This was very nice- only thing I didn't like- The admission did not include some of the new ( and what I thought would have been interesting ) exhibits . You had to pay extra- which I did not do.,The building itself is already worth of visit
"December 4, 2017",Natural History Museum is probably one of the most beautiful buildings in London. It's already by itself worth of visiting. Museum itself is huge and there is no point even trying to see it all in once. I really enjoyed the animal history on my visit!,Fantastic 
"December 2, 2017","Wow, what a fabulous place to visit. The building itself is quite spectacular. Visited with my son while staying in London for a mid week break. We spent many hours here as there is plenty to see. By far the best museum in London. Highly recommend a visit if you are in London. ",You could spend a whole day here
"December 1, 2017","This place remains an amazing example of Britain at its very best. A wonderful collection of natural history exhibits, housed in exquisite surroundings.",One of the best museums in the world
"November 29, 2017","Some of the best exhibits, set in a gorgeous building, with no entry fee. What more could you ask for? When I visit museums in other countries I travel to, which are very rarely free, I'm always underwhelmed compared to the museums London has to offer.I've been going here probably once a year since I was a child and there's always something new to see. The 'late' nights are fun if you're over 18 - no screaming kids running around and alcohol is served!",Good visit of geology area
"November 28, 2017","I went there mainly interested to the geological sector and it is simply awesome. At Sunday, full of families ( mainly at the dinosaurs)!",Incredible Museam With Everything You Could Think Of!!!!!
"November 28, 2017",We have been to the natural history museum multiple times and it has NEVER failed to impress us! It has everything from animals to mummys and it is perfect for any families day out.,Loved it. Wear comfy shoes!
"November 24, 2017","Planned on spending 2hr.. ended up leaving after 4hr!Went early, short line for security check. Earths crust... gems... Dinosaurs.. bugs.. whales.. dinosaurs.. elephants.. did I mention dinosaurs? HahaAnyways, we left the best till last.. Hintze Hall was MAGNIFICENT as always. Thank God photos are now digital or I'll be broke developing all the pics I took!",The best free museum in London.
"November 23, 2017","The Natural History Museum is the best free museum of natural history in London. This museum have about 80 million items. Here you can see dinosaurs skeletons, fish, reptiles, birds, mammals and more. The Natural History Museum is amazing place for the children and dinosaurs lovers (don’t forget to visit moving roaring model of a T.rex in the dinosaur area). ",Great for all ages
"November 18, 2017",Amazing photographic exhibition.  Building worth visiting whether you like museums or not. Ice rink outside in Christmas season,Amazing gem
"February 23, 2018",Very interesting and exciting for children and adults alike.  The blue whale is impressive but I would love to see Dippy the dinosaur back home ,Amazing 
"February 22, 2018","Really it is a nice historic place ... the entry is free , you just queue for security checkpoints . The museum is full of fossils and lots of information you can share with your little ones. The kids love being there . After enjoying the museum there is a room down stairs where kids can stay to eat and play and there is toilets as well . Before leaving check the shop for some unique stuff that kids will love it . ",Stunning Collection & Architecture 
"February 20, 2018","I only had a few hours to myself last week in London so I decided to spend them here. It turned out to be an extremely enjoyable and memorable decision. Visitors shouldn’t be intimidated by lines to get in. Hint: The line on the side street moved very quickly. While in line, take note of the shrapnel marks from the WWII German bombing raids near the side entrance. The line entering at the front of the museum moved slower I was told. There’s no cost for admission but a donation is properly encouraged. I gladly obliged. The varied, fascinating collections and exhibits blew me away. Seeing things in-person that I’d only read about and studied in school was a special experience. The architecture was just as stunning as the items on display. If you have even a marginal interest in natural history and/or science this museum is for you. Since I visited by myself, I was able to make it through the major areas in 3 hours. It was my 3rd visit to London but this was my first visit to the Natural History Museum. I now realize what I  missed on those previous visits. For visitors seeking an important, indoor, unforgettable, uniquely London experience (that’s Free!), I highly suggest you invest the time and effort into visiting and exploring this magnificent, extremely significant edifice.",Great choice!
"February 18, 2018","Recommended to families and kids! I spent a couple of hours in it and ti was amazing! The whale skeleton al the entrance is super, and so it is the whole museum. ",Inspiring museum!
"February 15, 2018",One of my top moments visiting London. A journey through time and science. The Darwin Centre and the Cocoon are breathtaking!  ,"Fascinating place, if you’re ok with crowds"
"February 14, 2018","The museum is understandably a real crowd puller. The dinosaur exhibits are a predictable hit, especially with the animatronic T. rex which is impressive. The pay for Exhibit on venom was worth a look if you’re interested in that sort of thing and we also liked the experience an earthquake exhibit. There’s obviously so much more besides. And of course it’s free to visit, though donations are, as with other museums, encouraged.You have to be ready for crowds though. We went school half term which obviously wasn’t great; but term time isn’t much better with school trips and tourists.",You won’t be bored!
"February 14, 2018","Oh boy! They have everything here,every person in your party will find something of interest from toddlers to the not so toddlers. How they have so much to show in one place is beyond me,spacious,well laid out. Be aware that exhibitions can carry a charge and the museum can get very crowded,I have had to queue on a few occasions,it’s well worth the wait though. Nice place for a bite to eat or a cuppa inside too. Of course they have the Butterfly exhibit in the summer,and the ice skating rink in the winter,truly something for everyone,especially on a rainy day.",Nothing to see here
"February 14, 2018","The building is lovely, queued for over half an hour in the rain to get in. Yes it was half term and yes it was total chaos, but despite the crowds, there really isn't much to see here. The mammals section - all the the stuff hanging from the ceiling is caked in thick dust - revolting! Most of the dinosaur bones are in fact plaster casts....The best thing was the escalator - which is a bit sad isn't it? Kids didn't like it either and were bored.Can't understand what all the fuss is about!",Very good day out
"February 13, 2018",I had a very good day out there with my family. I would come again but I would suggest that you would bring younger children to this as it is based for them.Very expensive suggest bringing lunch.,Fantastic experience for kids and grownups alike
"February 12, 2018",I had already visited the great place some 15 years ago but this time I took my son of 8. Besides the obvious beautiful architecture of the building one can find lots of information about our world and every natural for or being in it. The “swim with whales” special section was particularly nice! A must visit when in London,Loved it. Wear comfy shoes!
"November 24, 2017","Planned on spending 2hr.. ended up leaving after 4hr!Went early, short line for security check. Earths crust... gems...

"November 18, 2017","Exhibitions range from really modern to old and dusty – but that made the experience charming. I would advice to come as early as possible, it got really crowded after a while. The café had good pricing and friendly service.",Amazing.
"November 18, 2017","I actually have nothing to say. The title explain everything. Free entrance museum that would be worthy of a 30 pounds entrance ticket. Except for a couple section that were close cause they were working on them, every single corner of this museum will leave you amazed. If you're coming to London this is a MUST see. ",A pefect place for children
"November 18, 2017",We visited the museum last week and my six years old son couldn't get enough of this. He loved it. Beautiful building inside and outside and every room keeps a surpise for everyone. And of course there is a lovely place to enjoy your coffee or your food.,A great day out for adults and kids.
"November 16, 2017","The Natural History Museum is wonderful for any age. It's always a good day out! You need to dedicate a few hours to it, but it's worth looking round all of it, there's so much variety.",Great place
"November 14, 2017","visited the museum and was very impressed. I did not have all the time that i would have liked to spend there, but from what i have seen it is a great place to see and learn about a lot of things. Great place for youngsters, and school children, which there were many during my visit.",Not what i expected
"November 12, 2017","Maybe i had the wrong type of idea in mind but the museum just didn't really have the amount of stuff i thought it would and so was left disappointed. Don't get me wrong, for a free museum it's brilliant and has a fantastic section on dinosaurs! There's plenty of shops and eateries to use too. The worse part of the trip was the millions of school children just running wild all over the place with the teachers just leaving them to it, but what can you do? ",Amazing!!
"November 10, 2017",We spent all day there and still not enough time to see it all. The building is gorgeous and we most enjoyed the mineral and gem exhibits. Tons of families and kids and I could see they really enjoyed the dinosaurs and whales exhibits. We took a break and had cake and coffee and the quality was very good. What a special place.,Great visit (much better than the Science Museum!)
"November 9, 2017","We were a little apprehensive visiting after going to the Science Museum and being disappointed the previous day, but we could have spent the whole day here. The museum is free with currently just one discreet exhibition to opt to pay to see. It is a lovely building, with plenty of room, lots of great exhibitions  - mammals, dinosaurs, volcanoes, fossils great interactive elements and the children loved the escalator. The staff were good, talking to us about predators. Lots of places to eat and good shops.In the garden is the Indian Ocean Tsunami memorial which is of personal significance so important to visit for us.",Another amazing museum in London
"November 7, 2017","This museum has so many different facets and topics covered, it should have something for everyone, especially if you throw in the amazing architecture. Our personal highlights: the earthquake simulator, the dinosaurs (don't miss the TRex robot), the large hall with the whale skeleton and the gem and minerals hall",Nice
"November 3, 2017","Visited it with my husband and three kids (12, 10 and 7). Went on a weekday so it wasn’t very crowded. My kids enjoyed all the different sections. I loved the planet escalator. We had a break at the restaurant where the kids had fries & hot chocolate. We had a lovely time ",Amazing place
"November 1, 2017","The Natural History Museum was my number one museum to visit in London and it turned out to be my favourite. The beautiful building makes just walking up to the entrance impressive and walking through the door into the huge entrance hall impresses just as much. I've wanted to see it since seeing Attenborough make shows there and it is a great place, very informative and is a place to definitely bring kids if they have any interest in nature or animals.",Interesting...
"November 1, 2017","A must see for tourists and Londoners alike. Was a lovely time... one of the best activities we did with my sister and friends during the school holidays.Very, very busy on Saturdays, as you can imagine.",Dinosaurs a big hit
"November 1, 2017",Very busy and would want to keep a close eye on small kids.  The size of the building allows for the volume of people that go through it.  The dinosaur exhibit was a big hit and the moving t-rex was excellent.   Great place to visit with kids 5+,Trip down memory lane with my grown up children 
"October 31, 2017","Really lovely building , but the exhibits are looking a bit tired in some areas . Overall though worth a visit . ",A plunge into the past
"October 27, 2017",The Natural and History Museum of London is another amazing place where you can go to have a fun and discover interesting things about the world and take a photos of you with the most important attractions. At the moment they are building an amazing Ice rink.,Awesome 
"October 25, 2017","Visited last weekend with my brother, his girlfriend and my almost 5 year old son. Free entry, well worth a visit. Lots of interactive activities for children to get involved in. We spent around 3 hours here and could have stayed longer. Amazing and highly recommend for adults and children alike. ",Family day out 
"October 24, 2017","I took my 2 teenage daughters, 9 year old son and 5 year old daughter to visit the museum.We got the at 9.45am, luckily there wasn't much queue and we got in within 10 minutes. The Dinosaurs section was amazing, we all enjoyed it and thought that was the best part.The building is beautiful with lots to see.Well worth a visit and appealing to all ages. ",Hope left us in Awe
"October 23, 2017","A visit to see Hope and we were not disappointed. The Blue Whale Skeleton is astonishing and we stood for ages just mesmerised by it. The building itself is just beautiful and impressive at that.We particularly liked, after Hope, the Birds section.Taxidermy at it's finest.Educational, inspiring and fun for all ages the museum is a must if you are in London.",That whale hanging from the ceiling...
"October 20, 2017","My friend and I were walking on Cromwell road as we spotted a pretty interesting cathedral-like building... we steped in to have a looksy and we realised what sort of ""building"" that was only when we spotted that amazing reproduction of a blue whale's skeleton hanging from the ceiling...wow, what a place!! Free entry but it deserves all the donations it can it!",Temple of science
"October 18, 2017","A true temple dedicated to the beauty of the scientific language, the power that this place has to inspire us giving us the feeling of curiosity about each centimeter. ",Whale Show
"October 17, 2017",The whale show at the NHS is a must see. Learned so much. Not crowded on a weekday morning. Lovely building.,Jennie and Elliot Museum Day
"October 16, 2017","This museum is opposite the Q & A, so you can do the two in one day, however in the afternoons especially holidays and weekends it is really crowded and you will have to queue to wait to enter.  Great for children. We were hoping to see the dinoseaur exhibits again but they have been replaced by ""the whale"" at the moment. Probably more for children than adults, but great just the same",So much to see
"October 16, 2017",You really need a day at each Musuem not just a few hours. This building is beautiful inside and out. Displays are grouped in sections and the dinosaurs are very ones favorites. Who knew “Sid” from movie Ice Age was soooo big.,great
"October 14, 2017","always love coming to this fantastic museum, best i have visited. free entry to this museum that is located in a beautiful building and such a great area.",Well prepared look at history
"October 13, 2017",We enjoyed walking around the exhibits. Very informative. Expect big crowds. You will need a few hours.,Well worth the trip
"October 13, 2017",If you’re a bit of a science buff or have kids the museum is definitely worth the trip. Lots of interactive exhibits and very informative. The museum is HUGE so wear your comfy shoes and be ready to walk for a long time. Would recommend the t-Rex cafe as an intermission stop. ,Still An Awesome Museum.
"October 13, 2017","My favourite London Museum. Easy to spend the best part of a whole day here. The building itself and the architecture is mind blowing, but the displays on the various floors are still impressive. Dinosaur gallery is still simply The Best!",Incredible
"October 3, 2017",I saw so many dinosaurs! It's a donation to enter which is amazing anyone can go in! The line took no time at all! The security is friendlyThere is a massive cafe area with lovely food. The exhibitions are so well kept and beautifully presentedAnd the place is so massive I could've spent all day here!!! You walked for hours and around every corner something new to learn!!! I loved it every second ,"Great, great, great"
"October 1, 2017",Great for adults and children. Free entry and can spend ages here. Sometimes have to queue but it's great to happy to do so,A fine museum 
"September 28, 2017","We had a few hours, and walked past the nature historical museum and went in. There are lots of exhebisions and things to look at. The entrance is free but you are encourraged to donate £5. You can join guided tours for about £20.There are also interactive zones where you can test things and push buttons. Great for learning children about nature.I learned that insects do not have lungs. How about that? ",Free family fun
"September 27, 2017",I wanted to skip this museum as I thought animals look the same in every country and wanted to do something more British but I am glad I didn't miss it. It is well laid out for in depth or casual viewing. There were fun hands on things for kids; many of which my teenager enjoyed as well. It is less spread out than the British museum so it can feel more full but it also requires less walking to see a lot more. They have donation boxes but they did not ask for money at any time. Security checks your bags so make sure you don't carry sharp items on you when you go. The bag drop was a lifesaver. For a small fee you can have your bags safely stored for you while you enjoy the museum.,A truly fascinating museum. Prepare to spend many hours there.
"September 25, 2017","A large comprehensive museum with outstanding exhibits. In particular, the Whale exhibit was amazing.",Simply Brilliant!!
"September 24, 2017","What can I stay that others haven't? London's Natural History Museum houses the most incredible collection and exhibits for adults and the young. This is a must see attraction if you're visiting London - and it's free! We arrived at 5 minutes to 10:00 (opening) on a Sunday and there was already a line of people waiting to go in. Once open they let sections of groups through but it only took us around 10 minutes to get in. Not sure about the price of food sorry but they toilets were clean and the staff were very helpful. I wish I could have stayed all day. Would I go again? Well, this is my 3rd visit and yes, I'll be back again.",What a great museum!
"September 24, 2017","This is by far our favourite museum in London. You need more than one day to see everything, They have constant new exhibitions so make sure to always come back. Our favourite was the dinosaurs, the whale exhibition and the buttery section they have outside. Can get pretty busy during the season so make sure to apply for the family membership which allows you quick access to enter and no fees for the exhibitions.",After 35 years.....
"September 23, 2017", It's 35 years since we were here and this 2017 visit was wonderful. The initial exhibition rooms were crowded and had a bit of a dated feel to the exhibits but we found our way to the Cocoon and pretty well had the place to ourselves. It was brilliant and fascinating to see how scientists research and investigate our natural world. The interactive displays and opportunities to peep through the large windows watching people use various equipment was a real eye opener. This is the area to take kids to open their eyes about opportunities in science. ,My favourite building in London housing everything wonderful in the world 
"September 22, 2017","Awesome says it all. The building is a masterpiece with works of art on every pillar and staircase, floor and ceiling.The newly hung blue whale skeleton is fantastic.You have to really just pick one gallery and concentrate on that. We did minerals this time. Saw and learnt so much just to Holme us again with our amazing beautiful earth.A God given wonder this museum is.",A superb museum!
"September 21, 2017",It's taken a long time to get round to visiting this superb museum but it was worth the wait and didn't disappoint. An absolute must visit!,Nostalgic Day Trip
"August 31, 2017","Been to museum many times as my two kiddies grew up. They enjoyed every minute of it.A nostalgic trip with them as grown up kiddies. Bit disappointed the Dinosaur has been replaced with a whale. 😪 The actual dinosaur area apart from the T. rex was extremely disappointing - seems the museum has had a make over of partitioning boards and posters, The raised platform viewed dusty exhibits A museum of history  should still have that old world look, people in the lines around exhibits agreed it was disappointing 🤔Such a shame ",Another Great Free Museum in London!
"August 30, 2017","Stood in line (but only for about 20 mins) the museum is crowded because it is so popular, but it has something for everyone.  The kids were loving the dinosaurs and fossils.  Great family entertainment.  I had a very nice lunch in the sit-down cafe and had a nice burger and a beer, a bit pricey but good food and service and I was on holiday and wanted a nice respite from walking and site seeing.  Most enjoyable morning and early afternoon.  Very convenient to get to via public transportation (Tube or Bus).  ",Thoroughly captivating
"August 29, 2017","We took our kids (aged 6, 8 and 13) here. We had to line up for about 20mins, which wasn't too bad as the weather was OK - but be warned if it's inclement. Once inside, we purchased a map and then set off the see as much as we could. There is so much to see it would take more than the afternoon we devoted to it, but with kids you have to be selective. To that end, part of our trip included going to Iceland so we went and lookjed at the exhibit about Volcanos and the workings of the Earth. After that, my son was keen to see dinosaurs and following that, we went into the exhibit about mammals. My eldest daughter was fascinated with the human evolution exhibition and in all there was something for everyone.",Fantastic place.
"August 28, 2017","This place is for everyone. Since we are into science. This place was very attractive to us. In my opinion blue and green sections are really vast and they must be seen. We started from top and couldn't finish ground floor. We intend to visit again. If you're really into science, you can easily spend 2-3 hours in this place, maybe more.",Beautiful architecture and interesting exhibits
"August 28, 2017","In my opinion, Earth's Treasury was the best exhibit hall in the museum.  Compared to other natural history museums, this one has one of the best mineral exhibits I have seen and the Vault is a must see.  The dinosaur exhibit seemed popular with the many children at the museum, and was quite crowded.  We had 2 hours to spend here, and I would have liked more time to spend in the exhibits I found particularly engaging, we were definitely rushed.  This was also the most crowded museum we visited in London.",Disappointing 
"August 28, 2017","I don't know what to say. I don't know whether it was the darkness, or the relatively small spaces, or the great many visitors but it felt like I was forced into a mechanical viewing of the exhibits; people  were waiting behind me anxious to see what I was seeing and immediately in front of me the people who had just left. Awful experience. Nice and interesting exhibits, but couldn't really take them in.",Briliant 
"August 27, 2017","Exciting, knowledgeable, great for both kids and elderly. Well organised. The dinosaur section is the best, but mammal section, volcano section and most of the other sections are also worth visiting. ",Great place to visit with kids 
"August 27, 2017",Our children had a great day here. Lots for all age groups. Staff very helpful and friendly. It's free but they suggest £5 donation which is well worth it.,Extensive Mineral Collection!
"August 27, 2017","Easy to get to via tube from South Kensington stop. Great museum for all ages.  Excellent displays of fossils, wildlife, mammals, etc.  I was very impressed with the mineral display which took up almost the entire floor!  We always had a strong interest in minerals yet this collection was so vast from all over the world.  It was displayed beautifully and ws very organized.  I haven't seen anything like it!  The minerals displayed ranged from very large to small minerals.  (Sorry AZ) It was stunning and took a while to walk the entire area.  If you are a fan of minerals, this is where you want to be.  The vault with the real jewels (much smaller exhibit) is located at the back of the mineral display which is equally stunning.  Gift shop was large with a nice selection and reasonably priced.  No renovations were conducted nor other obstructions occurred during my visit.",Loved it!
"August 27, 2017","Absolutely loved this museum! If you have an interest in natural sciences this is definitely a must! Make sure you go in the morning though, I went after lunch and hadn't even seen the whole museum before they told us they were closing and we had to leave. I was sad that I didn't get to see the rest of the museum but what I saw was incredible! ",Fantastic day out!
"August 21, 2017",We took our Finnish friends here on their first trip to London. I hadn't been for years but it was a lovely day out with plenty of interactive exhibits and it's free. All the children learn't so much and it was a memorable day. The staff were very friendly especially in the cafe.,Use the back door
"August 20, 2017",Massive queues for the main entrance on Exhibition Road can be avoided by using the rear entrance on Queens Gate. We walked in with no delays when it seemed people were waiting hours on the other side. The main hall is very impressive for its architecture alone. ,"With the dinosaurs, whales and volcano"
"August 19, 2017","It's a huge museum filled with awesome dinosaur collection , whales and all other gods creature. And It also has a huge section about earth and volcanos and stimulated earthquake. If you are a kid you are definitely going to enjoy it, my 30 years old little brother enjoyed. And it's free. But a small donation is encouraged and frankly speaking it deserves it",A must go to!
"August 19, 2017",Everybody loved the natural history museum..there's so much to see and suits all ages! Staff are really friendly and are always happy to talk to the children about cool stuff! Go early to avoid queues!,Fantastic museum and FREE (mostly)!
"August 17, 2017","My wife visited the museum as a child and was keen that we take our 10 & 14 year old kids as part of our short trip to London.The main entrance is closed so we entered via the Queen's Gate.  Having arrived at 10.30am queue's were pretty good and it only took 15 mins to gain entry and on this side of the museum our first port of call was the BLUE zone and the Mammals section which was excellent other than the fact the weighing machine reckoned a Polar Bear only weighed 4 times my body weight.... the kids thought this was very funny too!?Next on to the Dinosaurs section.... this was my favourite bit with fascinating information and even a moving T-Rex model to bring it to life!  Fantastic!!!The Human Biology bit while holding lots of information is clearly one of the oldest parts of the museum and needs updating.... I felt like I was back in one of my boring 1980s Biology school lessons and I'm not sure my kids felt any different.Before heading on we went for lunch passing through the main hall (Hintze Hall) with the skeleton of 'Hope' the Big Blue Whale..... wow that is an impressive sight and the hall is stunning, reminding me of Hogwarts staircases etc in Harry Potter!Next up the GREEN zone... not really my cup of tea with minerals, birds, fossils etc but my wife was particularly taken by the VAULT where there were some pretty impressive gem stones.  I had to point out I didn't have that sort of money available to buy her one!Having already spent over 2 hours in this half of the museum we headed to the RED zone.  Unfortunately by this time the museum was extremely busy and while we attempted to have a look around, firstly taking the impressive escalator (in Earth Hall) to the top floor, it was far too busy to look at the earths evolution, volcanoes etc.... we instead headed for the exit.There is so much more to see and next time we are in London we will get there early and start at the opposite side (Exhibition Road).   We will also go to the Orange Zone and the special exhibitions (additionally paid for) as they look teriffic too.I can't believe this museum is free.... we left a donation (as you are asked too) and it was well worth it!!",The most beautiful building
"August 16, 2017","I love everything about natural History museum. I think it is a great place for adults and kids to go. Just very busy in summer, get there early.",So much fun!
"August 15, 2017","As someone who has spent hours in the Natural History Museum in New York, I was expecting to be disappointed by this museum, but was pleasantly surprised at the breadth and depth of the exhibits. The main hall is absolutely breathtaking, and the museum is aesthetically pleasing and architecturally impressive as well as educational. Definitely something not to miss on a trip to London!","Crowded, badly sign posted with fake exhibitions"
"August 14, 2017","I was really looking forward to going here and the queue to get in was insane. It definitely wasn't worth the wait, the staff on entry are rude and not very helpful when asking for guidance. The exhibits more often than not seem to be fake sculptures rather than genuine. It was badly crowded with tight hallways to get from one place to another. The signposts are laid out badly which makes it harder to find anything! I'm gutted I wasted my time with it I just hope it improves. ",Doesn't disappoint 
"August 10, 2017","Had a really enjoyable few hours here today, first at the butterfly experience and then inside the main museum.It is worth pointing out at this point that when paying to go into the butterflies you then qualify to fast track into the museum ( the queue was at 30 mins at 11.30 when we went in today)The new blue whale is amazing and so informativeAn amazing place, great for kids as the displays are very interactive. A beautiful building too",Great day out
"August 9, 2017","Visited here with my 3 kids.,as expected it did not let down. Huge amount to see and do,kids loved it ,hardest part was taking it all in. Wear comfortable shoes  and enjoy! ",Beautiful building
"July 21, 2017",Don't miss the details of the building itself. Beautiful!! The collection is fabulous as well. No line at the Queen's Gate entrance. ,Save for a rainy day!
"July 21, 2017",A fantastic museum. The exhibits are second to none. It was very crowded the day we visited but was still reasonable easy to negotiate with our sizable stroller.The kids loved the T-Rex!!! ,Disappointing 
"July 19, 2017",I felt it was aimed very much at young children with a huge amount of fake or mock exhibitions rather than actual skeletons. The equivalent in Oxford was far more fascinating. Glad I saw it!,Pleasant museum
"July 16, 2017",This was an interesting museum with lots of exhibits. Would be very good for kids but was interesting for this adult too. I found a lot of the collections to be very interesting  and mostly collected in another time. Couldn't get some of the exhibits today. Pleasant was ro spend a day and much better than the science museum next door.,Better Than New York's and That Says it All
"July 15, 2017","My 10 year old son was getting a little cranky as travel can wear on all children.  Decided to go here on a rainy afternoon and bet him an ice cream that this one would be better than the Natural History museum in NYC.  Well at first he was quite adamant about our beloved NYC, but at the end it was no contest.  The entire family agreed.  Free entry makes it all the better.    ",Interesting
"July 13, 2017","We visited last weekend. It's a big museum, very nice but we found very much for children and families.It would be nice day out and kids will love it. The only downfall was that no Aircon was on and it was just too hot and quite smelly inside.They should put some nice air fresheners used in big hotels, areas in Asia. It would make a huge difference. ",A must see in London
"July 12, 2017","Amazing place to visit.So many things to explore for all people.Free entry (donations welcomed).Large building so never crowded, lovely food and very clean/tidy.Have visited a few times and is always on my list when I visit London.",Interesting 
"July 12, 2017","I just loved the museum. It can be a whole day visit, there are so many things to see and learn. Amazing! ","Been going since I was born, wonderful building and great exhibits"
"July 12, 2017","I have been visiting this beautiful place with my father and now my children for 30 odd years. The museum itself is a wonder but the building is also stunningly beautiful in its own right, intricate and beautiful with animal carvings etc. I grew up with the diplodocus in the maiin hall so miss it but thats a personal preference. Nearby are the science and british museums too and lovely restaurants and cafes to visit. All is all a wonderful corner of london",Dinosaurs.... gggrrrrrrr
"July 12, 2017","Took my two year old daughter- she loved the dinosaurs, photo exhibition and butterfly house. We didn't get to anything else- ran out of time ",Oh so amazing. 
"July 9, 2017",This is a must see attraction in London! The escalator up is amazing! The outside is great. And the exhibits will just blow you away! But be sure you arrive early as the queues can go right down the street!,"Good, if you like animals & their history."
"July 6, 2017","My husband and I went to the Natural History Museum whilst on our honeymoon in London, and it was a nice experience, although not absolutely amazing. If you really like animals and learning about their history (especially dinosaurs, extinct and endangered animals, etc.) It is worth seeing. It is a beautiful museum, massive and spacious. It is definitely worth seeing at least once, but not exactly at the top of the must-see list when in London. ",Somewhat disappointing.
"July 6, 2017","I had been here before and loved it. However, this time it was undergoing renovations and it seems like they are enclosing that grand hall to make smaller rooms.  I hope I'm wrong because that was the highlight of the whole museum. This visit felt really claustrophobic.  My daughter still loved the dinosaur room and seeing all of the stuffed animals. Hopefully the renovations will turn out fine in the end.",Good for a first time but...
"July 5, 2017","They are renovating so the feel of the museum was different for me this time.  There are still many of the fun things to explore- the dinasaurs, the gems, animals, etc. but getting to the temporary entrance was not easy.",Amazing!!
"July 4, 2017","The museum is a must-go destination if you are visiting London!! The whole experience is very fascinating and you will see things you cannot see anywhere else from dinosaur bones to precious rocks!! You will deffinately learn some fascinating facts and broaden your knowledge!! Although you might have to wait for a really long time in line to enter, its worth the wait!! Deffinately an amazing experience and would suggest this!!",Wonderful Museum
"June 30, 2017",Our 16 year old granddaughter loved this museum and no wonder as it is so well done with attention to detail and animation.  It is a perfect museum for younger kids as well as adults--in summary it has appeal to every age group which is unique.,"A real ""old style"" museum"
"June 30, 2017","I was here with my wife and my two small daughters (3 and 5) and we enjoyed.You can see quite a lot of attractions, the ""typical"" skeletons, the animals, but also a lot about human being and all what is related to humans.The museums contain also couple of good bars to get refreshments and food.",The best museum in London
"June 30, 2017",This place is really really cool and I've been there a bunch of times. Always learn something new. Great for kids and adults. Their gift shop is amazing. It's free. Food options in the museum are not great but you can bring your own packed food or wander around to find something nearby. They do have a picnic area.,Wow
"June 29, 2017","This was my first visit at the museum, it was very educational. I went with my children who found the dinosaur a bit scary but realised it's fake. overall we enjoyed our time at the Museum and we highly recommend for everyone to come here for some good knowledge",brill
"June 29, 2017",absolutely brilliant not only for children but for adults all you got to make is a contribution to the history museum it's got loads of interesting things to do my friends and the kids really enjoyed the dinosaur bit the most but I personally really enjoyed the human body part the most it's packed loads with facts and information not only do the kids learn new things but so do the adults as well . very much recommend going there ,The Natual History Museum is definetly a must-go in London!
"June 7, 2019","From venue to all species and contents this is a Must Go! Although you can enter for free an donation is recommended and it is worth it.The species from insects to mammals, from dinossaurs to birds there is a lot to learn..Take the kids!There are many interactive spots where you can learn how the species work.(ed)Already extinct species, you can also learn about that...There is a zone with real-size representations of diferent kind of animals for size comparision wow it will blow your mind! For instance... whales ... we imagine them so big.... they are not so big close to the old Blue Whale... or the mammut compared to the elephants... Take my advise go, you will not regret it!!",Hummmm
"June 7, 2019","Went this week to the museum haven’t been for a couple of years as mostly go to science museum. Amazing as ever - didn’t do it all just did mammals dinosaurs and the body . It wasn’t to busy as not school holidays so it was lovely.  However I would say it was all very dusty , and I mean very dusty which was sad to see. Use to be able to walk above the dinosaurs which made you feel you were really close now you can’t which isn’t very good.  May be it’s these areas time to be cleaned next but it definitely needs it.",Beautiful venue
"June 7, 2019",Was really busy when we went and had to leave because it was so hot.But staff were nice and helpful.,I can’t believe this amazing place is FREE to enter!!
"June 6, 2019","It blows my mind that such an amazing museum is free to enter. I’ve paid over $40 US to enter museums smaller than this and with less displays. Strongly recommend donating to help them keep up the museum. I went 2 hours before closing time and realized I should have allowed myself more time. There was so much to see! I ended up skipping over some things to ensure I got to see the displays that truly fascinated me. As a marine biologist, I’ve always loved any marine life displays. The blue whale skeleton is amazing, but it amazed me when I realized that this wasn’t the only whale skeleton on display! There were 5 - the blue whale in the main entrance, then a bowhead whale, a right whale, a sperm whale, and a gray whale in the mammal display. There was also a life size blue whale model with over a dozen other life size cetacean models including orcas, Risso’s dolphin, narwhals, etc. The displays along the sides were highly educational as well. I do wish that the shark and ray displays were a bit larger. Corals and cnidarians had an entire room while there were 2 small displays that contained various sharks. ",Can Spend All Day Here
"June 6, 2019","We had a tight schedule which is a shame! Entrance is free but they recommend a donation for upkeep.So many things to see and great for children too with lots of interactive things.Old exhibits of insects, birds and mammals. Dinosaur exhibit. Human body and much more! And all in an amazing building.Nice location as a walk from Hyde Park and Harrods ",Lunar model library 
"June 6, 2019","Lunar model library is so wonderful！It is suitable for both young and old. You can see countless rare animal specimens, the history of natural development, and even learn about the birth of life. These are very beneficial to our knowledge, well worth going. Of course we need a map because it's so big.",An amazing museum 
"June 6, 2019","It was a sunny day yesterday，you can see the appearance of the museum very clearly. It is also said to be the setting for the museum's wonderful night movie, so it looks particularly familiar. The building is magnificent. Upon entering the door, I was attracted by the skeleton fossils of the large mammontosaurus. In addition, here almost covers the complete biological evolution history of the earth and the specimens of most of the creatures on the earth. The exhibits are so comprehensive and rich that they are mind-boggling. They are really wonderful and informative. Another interesting exhibit is the moon museum.This moon was photographed by NASA on a scale of 1:500,000. In addition, the moon is not regularly shown on a global scale and is about two months away from its next destination. You can take the subway to the south kensington station and walk about five minutes to see the museum.",One of the best museums to visit
"June 6, 2019",Full of wonder and awe.  Such a huge place that it cannot be covered in one day.  I know there are some wonders that I have yet to see.,Great museum for kids in London
"June 6, 2019","Great for kids and not only! A lot of interesting facts, interactive exhibitions and things to learn both for kids and adults! Probably not the best place for kids under 2 y.o. as they seemed to be bored but my 8 y.o. was very excited and will remember this visit for years!",Crowds !!!
"June 6, 2019","Join the queue, then queue again.Always busy, tons of school groups. ( use the side entrance near the science museum) no queue 😊Food is expensive and portions small. Take a picnic or eat near the tube, plenty of good cheap places. ",A great experience . Everything about Science.
"May 25, 2017","Wonderful Museum. Everything everybody want to know about science. Earth volcanos dinossaurs , name it. You will fins there.  ",Lots to see
"May 22, 2017","If you want to see dinosaur bones, they have them. If you want to see a variety of animals that live (and used to live) around the world, they have them. If you want to see many different types of rocks, gems, and other geological items, they have them.A great museum for all things natural history. It has its collections arranged and located in different ""zones"". Example: Green Zone for collections related to Earth's evolution.Plus, plenty of shops, usually themed to the zone they are in. Note: the Hintze Hall is closed for until July and the Diplodocus skeleton will be no longer be in the hall. Because of this, the main entrance on Cromwell Road is temporarily closed.",Amazing Museum
"May 21, 2017","The natural history museum is huge and located in a really nice building. I would advise anyone to visit on a week day as it is super crowded on the weekend. It is also perfect to bring children along as they have dinosaur exhibitions and various other exhibitions which are interesting for children. If you have many days to spend in London or live there, you might want to consider dividing the museum over several days.",Wonderful!
"May 15, 2017",What a great museum.  There is so much to see and do - loads of interactive attractions. An architecturally stunning building. The admission is free - it doesn't get much better than that!,Brilliant and it is free
"May 12, 2017","Great attraction for a rainy day. You can leave your bags in the cloakroom, this is great for tourists. But cloakroom is not free!",Entire History within one building
"May 10, 2017",Visited this place last month. This place is very close and walking distance from the nearest tube station. The collections are enormous and very interesting. One can spend full day here. Mornings are crowded and hence afternoon sessions are better. Admission is free to all. The Science museum and Victoria and Albert Museums ate also very close and within walking distance. Highly recommended.,A thing of beauty.
"May 10, 2017","Don't get me wrong i'm not a usual Museum goer, saying that my son wanted to see the dinosaurs so this is where we went. Well, when I say it is the most impressive spectacle I have ever seen is an understatement. This place is amazing. You could walk around it for hours. We went on Saturday afternoon and it was packed to the rafters, so for little legs at 3ft tall the crowds were a little overwhelming but it was beautiful, yes that's the word for this place, pure beauty. The dinosaur exhibit is amazing and very informative, a real live (kinda) T-Rex and other moving pieces made it even more exiting. Would highly recommend it, maybe mid week for smallies.",An amazing museum
"May 7, 2017",You should definitely visit if you like natural history. An amazing place with a lot of different exhibitions and well curated rooms. Wildlife photographer of the year is a must so try to combine your visit with this exhibition too and you will be a winner! Best museum in London? Maybe ,A Must for all Tourists to London
"May 5, 2017","I have been going here with my grand-daughter for about 6 years but you will neversee it all I am sure.Unless we are able to get there very early, we tend to leave it as the queues can be horrendous",Be prepared for the builders 
"May 3, 2017","After checking online we noticed no restrictions listed, after getting the tube over and walking towards the entrance covered in scaffolding we found we had to go back on ourselves to the street to find the entrance. Then we were told for certain exhibits we had to go back on our selves again and for some keep walking to find the other entrance. When we finally got in, their wasn't enough exhibits open to deal with the crowds in there, you simply couldn't get moved and the experience was so stressful and exhausting! Just not worth it until it's fully open again ",Nice and enjoyable place !
"May 2, 2017","For adults and child, a ver nice place, full of things to interact or just see !!!Dinosaurs and mammals, whales, big or smalls insects, and a LOT OF TIPS and things to live and remind. ",Interesting and HUGE museum... 
"April 29, 2017",The entrance hall alone is worth seeing. There's an earthquake simulator in the second floor! And quite a lot of facts about animals and the human body. You learn a lot. ,Great museum 
"April 28, 2017",Spent quite a few hours here and could've spent a lot more. So much to see and the exhibits are all very engaging as well as some are interactive.  The mechanical model of the T-Rex dinosaur was pretty realistic and a must see. Highly recommend a visit for people of all ages.,Good for children
"April 27, 2017","Well to start with, I think my expectations for this museum were quite high. I had read several really good reviews and people told me that it was definitely worth a visit. I was a bit disappointed to be honest. When we arrived there was this really long queue to get in because they were searching bags. I think we waited like half an hour. Then when we finally got in I was a bit disappointed that it were just a lot of taxidermy. I think for children it would be really great to learn about all of this but for me it just creeped me out a bit and there wasn't really anything of new information about them. The moving T-rex however is great, we had a really good laugh. The other downside was that it wasn't just busy outside but also on the inside. You couldn't walk freely but had to queue to move slowly past each animal. We left after being inside for a quarter of an hour.",Great museum with a lot of visitors
"April 27, 2017","First of all I want to say that the museum itself is amazing. The things one can explore are really great and interesting.The only problem is the distribution of visitors. It is extremely crowded, so that one cannot read the signs properly, because one has to make space for 10 other people waiting to read it. If you don't like crowded places, avoid this museum. Unfortunately we were unlucky that the dinosaur area was rebuild, so we couldn't enjoy the exhibition fully.",Dinosaur display is not what I expected 
"April 25, 2017","I purposely visit for its dinosaur but was left dissapointed mainly because I carry lots of expectation. Was hoping to see bone that is taller than a house but it was only a few small sizes on display.  I've been to the museum in Washington DC 12-15 years ago and that one has amazing dinosaur fossils and sceleton display, so I guess this is the reason why I was dissapointed in this London museum.My hubby has never been to the D.C. Museum and he seems quite amused with the displAy. Good to bring along children.",Crowds
"April 24, 2017","A great museum but crowded with people bumping into each other all along the way. We visited on a weekday afternoon, I can only imagine what it's like on a weekend.",Family visit
"April 22, 2017",Kids loved :) too many people visiting it..but it was ok. would recomend during week days early morning. best earth history seen . excelente.,You can see more at every visit
"April 19, 2017","Having been 3 times now, and we always visit the dinosaurs (can't not see the t-rex!) and the mammals but the creepy crawlies, birds and human biology are also worth a visit. I always feel like we see more each time, and there is still much more there to see that's perhaps not quite so attractive to an 8 year old but may be when she's older. ",Awesome Museum--plan for a long visit
"April 17, 2017","This was such a great visit and one of the best museums I've visited. If you're strapped for time, they have a list of the most popular attractions to streamline the visit. When we went, we attempted to wander for the first while, and eventually became a bit exhausted and hit up the best of list and whatever was along the way.",Great for all ages
"March 27, 2017",Fantastic museum with loads to see.Great that it is a free attraction with a suggested donation.Easily spend over an hour here.,Fantastic Museum Well Worth Your Time
"March 23, 2017",I would put this on a par with the Smithsonian as a must see if you have the time. Understanding that British history is much longer than US. The evening I attended they were opening a new exhibit and everyone was walking around enjoying a glass of wine (cash bar) - classy and relaxing. Everything from the Renaissance to the Romans to Dinosaurs and Science. The exhibits of Gothic architecture were impressive and memorable. ,Seeing dinosaurs was the best experience at this museum
"March 22, 2017","I love dinosaurs, and I was very excited to go to this museum. It didn't disappoint me! My favorite museum, worth a visit! Get ready to be there for about 2 hours, because there are really many interesting things there.",An experience to remember
"March 19, 2017","We went with our children as it is a family favourite. Our parents took us many years ago, we take ours & they ask to return. You can only really do about 1/7 of the museum per visit , there is such a variety - so it's wise to plan what you want to see in advance. The restaurant is excellent but as expected gets very busy and waiting time for a table can easily be 40 minutes - we planned to eat early & had no wait. The main hall is spectacular, the surroundings and architecture as awesome as the exhibits.",Afternoon Visit
"March 19, 2017",Good to know in advance that the main entrance is currently closed - use side entrance next to V&A Museum.  This means walking through the whole museum to get to the dinosaur exhibit (the reason for our visit).  Look forward to seeing the main hall this summer once the blue whale skeleton is up and the refurb is finished.  We went on a Saturday and the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibit was sold out - buy tickets in advance online if you're interested in that specific exhibit.  Great spot to visit with the kids and lots of good gift shops too.  Wonderful that museums like this are still free to the public.,Superb exhibits on display in a magnificent building
"March 18, 2017","I went to this museum specifically to see the ""Wildlife Photographer of the Year"" exhibit, and I was not disappointed. The photographs are simply stunning and exceptionally well displayed. (There's an app that allows visitors to read the captions on their mobile devices so that they can stand back to enjoy the full impact of the image rather than having to stand up close, jostling elbows with other viewers.) So I heartily recommend paying the entrance fee for this exhibit. But given that I was inside the museum, I found myself drawn to the different displays. The dinosaurs were really well done -- you can see there's tremendous appeal for kids. Other exhibits were equally informative and attractive.In fact, just looking at the interior architecture of the building was a real joy and worth the time spent: I was especially intrigued by the symbols that twined their way up exquisitely carved stone pillars.",What used to be a premium museum has turned into a disaster
"March 18, 2017","Don't go. Anyone who visited this museum before the late nineties will be horrified with the terrible mismanagement that has turned what was a must visit attraction into a unmitigated disaster.The lack of exhibits is a scandal as is the clear attempts to maximise the museums profits (10 food outlets + 1 shop), by removing exhibit space to fit in all these food outlets has turned the museum into a joke.It's true that the museum is overrun with young children, however, I would think that is somewhat encouraging that their parents have managed to drag them away from their tablets.The costs to visit some of the exhibitions upstairs are ridiculous, far better to charge an admission fee and allow everyone access to whatever grabs their fancy.Go to the V&A for an insight into how the NHM used to be and weep at the cultural vandalism inflicted by obviously common purpose type savages.",Lovely and calm
"March 17, 2017",Nice calm museum and lots of fun with friends and family have been here many times and I love the earthquake Chinese shop bit! I love the escalators that lead through the centre of the earth and the dinosaur exhibit is a must see but sadly this month when I came it was closed. The food here is expensive but the shops and souvenirs are mostly affordable and really lovely! You have to go! ,Superb
"March 15, 2017",Superb. The building is magnificent. Guaranteed great time for kids and grown-ups alike. Definitely a must. Dinosaurs section is the best. Free entrance - to avoid the long lines use the entrance on Exhibition Road.,See the Portraits
"March 8, 2017",Every time I go to London I visit the National Portrait Gallery it's always a highlight. Very highly recommended.,Not very impressed 
"March 7, 2017","My boyfriend and I visited the Natural History Museum during a trip to London for my birthday and were not particularly impressed. We had to queue up in the rain for a good 25-30 mins before getting in and this was at 10.30am! We had to reschedule a reservation we had for later on that day so that we could visit the museum and I'm afraid to say it wasn't worth it.There were several groups of school children on field trips which is great but they were running riot, making loads of noise and were really rude. I know this is down to the adults responsible for these children but it really made it a bad experience for us. I think they're renovating at the moment so we missed out on a couple of things which was a shame but again, these things have to be done and can't be helped. We spent a good 3 hrs here but were quick to leave and probably won't be returning. I was really disappointed but might give it another chance if I'm ever back in London.",Very busy but well worth going to
"March 4, 2017","We visited this early afternoon, and there was only a short queue (Wednesday). Inside however was very busy, especially at the start (earthquakes & volcanoes), and at the dinosaurs. If you have younger kids they should love this. The dinosaur exhibition is being redone so not as impressive as expected.  I would have loved more time, we just had under 2 hours so were quite quick.  ",Lots to see
"February 27, 2017","We visited this on our second day, we arrived too late the first day and the queue was huge so we didn't go in. We were there for it opening the next day and still had about 50 people in front of us. Kids love it, especially the dinosaurs and the whale. Really somewhere everyone should visit. However we called into the kitchen for food but there was nothing available early on for a coeliac to eat so just had tea, one of the milk jugs and cups had to be returned as they were dirty, several people in the queue behind us also returned their jugs of milk so that wasn't too good.  Other than that was a great day out.",Huge and free!!!
"February 25, 2017",Amazing big museum. One day is not enough for the whole place. And it's free!!I would love for it to be paid on weekends so that the crowd is limited.,Great few hours 
"February 24, 2017","Best museum I have ever been in.  Just do it . The dinosaur side,  queens entrance is the better place to start. ",Stuck in the past?
"February 23, 2017","Sorry but we were disappointed. The queue to get in horrendous, constantly being queue jumped by school parties. the place was overrun by noisy school kids, couldn't look at the exhibitions. We found the exhibits to be dusty and just not looking at their best, the whole place needs a good clean.You'd be better off spending your time in the V & A, far more tranquil and enjoyable.Sorry for the poor review but we based our entire stay around going to this museum and felt let down. ",The building itself was even amazing!
"February 21, 2017","Beautiful architecture, great exhibits and a gorgeous building! I didn't go with any kids-it was just me and my husband, so I didn't go into all the kids exhibits...but what I did see I enjoyed. They also had a exhibit showing award winning animal or nature photography by kids-some as young as 10...stunning! That was a separate charge from the museum entrance, but worth every penny. ",Amazing 
"February 20, 2017","My 10 year old son was buzzing, so many things to see and well set out and veryInteresting, also cafe and toilet facilities excellent. Well done ",Lovely Museum
"February 20, 2017","A great place for adults and children.. Their are interactive areas where you and your kid's can enjoy taking part in the games and tasks.. Best of all, it's free..!",Lovely museum!
"February 17, 2017",Lovely museum with many interesting exhibitions. It was extremely busy when we visited so we would recommend going early to avoid the large crowds. ,"Beautiful Building, Great Exhibits"
"January 4, 2017","If you love Dinosaurs and Nature this is your museum.  Great exhibits lots of information to read, use the guides to help you appreciate what your seeing.  Our Teen kids really enjoyed this museum and we spent 3-4 hours there.  As it was New Years Day it was very crowded and some sections were closed off which was a little disappointing.  Would visit again.",Wonderful!!!!!
"January 1, 2017",We stayed at Ibis Hotel Earl's Court(The wife and me) and took the underground from West Brompton station to South Kensington station to visit the Natural Museum. We were simply astounded by the enormity of the building and the multitude of displays and exhibitions in it. Given that the entrance is free the quality of the exhibits was nothing short of amazing! My wife's a secondary school teacher and she remarked how much effort and money the U.K spent on maintaining the museum and henceforth on education. We spent quite a bit of time in the dinosaurs exhibit with the giant scorpion and t- rex mechanical displays. The large fossils of sea predators displayed on the walls of the museum were simply amazing. The lighting was good and helped amplify the visual effects they wanted to create. I'd say this is probably the best place to spend your whole day if you have the time in London. We were there for slightly over 3 hours only as we had plans for high tea at Milestone Hotel not that faraway. If we make our way back to London we'll definitely visit the Natural History Museum again for a longer visit and walk. This is a must visit for all ages. ,Almost a negative...yawn
"January 1, 2017","Nearly gave this 2 out of 5 but I'm feeling in a generous mood. The building itself is beautiful and very impressive, but the contents are simply depressing on the whole. Yes there are a few gems, but 90% of the content is just awful, outdated and frankly boring. The whole place feels like time has stood still. Maybe this is their intention, or maybe they lack the budget and imagination to achieve more. I wouldn't discourage any enthusiastic taxidermist or family on a tight budget from popping in, but if you have a limited time in this great city, steer well clear-there is very little worth seeing.",Amazingly educational for young ones
"December 31, 2016","First time in London with my grade schooler. An abundance of museums side-by-side but the Natural History Museum struck a cord and we headed there first!A cathedral-style building and definitely inspiring 👍🏼One day was simply not enough. We took our time walking through the Hintze Hall where the skeleton of ""Dippy"" (the gigantic herbivore, Diplodocus) occupies center stage - mind you he will go on a tour outside of the museum in 2017. This naturally led to the dinosaur exhibition and we spent a good 3 hours there.In the afternoon we joined the behind-the-scenes tour (min. age 8) and our little one was awed by the numerous glass gaskets in Darwin Centre displaying the many preserved specimens. We had a brief glance of the blue whale model and will surely have to return to the museum many times (& will need to plan a trip to London every year)!A final note, there is no entrance fee and we bought the kid's guide. ",Love this placw
"December 28, 2016","If you love animals and history this is perfect for you! Lots you to see, they also do great talks which are well worth it if you have time",Natural History Museum for Free
"December 25, 2016","We've been to many natural history museums and this one ranks up with the best.  The problem, is that we've been to many natural history museums and the good ones of course cover the same things.  If you don't go to many museums, than this is exceptional especially since it's free (you can give an optional donation).  What's funny, is that the kids found the bubble blowing street act almost as interesting---what small kids find interesting still blows me away.  Tip--there are two entries into the museum.  Queues buildup about an hour before opening. If you want to be there early, checkout the queue on the side entrance NOT the main entrance.  Alternatively, go later in the day when there isn't anyone in line--possibly even just a few hours after opening.My summary--go if you have 2 hours and are nearby--or if you don't get a chance to visit a natural history museum often.  Don't go if you're looking to be wowed by something extraordinary or visit these types of museums at home.  The R&A and British Museums are different and interesting with items that we don't necessarily have in the USA.",Highly Reccomend!
"December 16, 2016",National History Museum in London! What a great experience to learn more about London! There is a Diplodocus Dinosaur in the main room/hall and more!,no queue 
"December 13, 2016",I've visited this museum last Sunday around 4pm and there was no queue. However it was so crowded that sometimes you lose time waiting to get free way and other times there are too many people in your front seeing the same piece.,Immense repository of knowledge - something for everyone
"December 13, 2016","Visiting this place is a no-brainer for me each time I have 2 or 3 hours to spare during a trip to London. Unfortunately, I invariably spend those hours perusing the World Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibit. I know its wall harbour a phenomenal vastness of information and I think (hope) that eventually, I will begin to broaden my savouring of its offerings. I cannot imagine that anyone will be disappointed by a visit.",Nice museum
"December 12, 2016","Been there for some hours, it's really cool if you like science, biology and dinosaurs. It's a big place, no tickets need, amazing building to see from the inside.",Interesting!
"May 8, 2019",Nice museum to take refuge from the rainy days of London ! :) Very new facilities and good location. ,Amazing museum
"May 8, 2019","This was such a fun and interesting museum, and like most museums in London, free! Expect a crowd even in the offseason, as many locals visit often. The building itself is massive and a work of art in its own right. I'm sure the dinosaur exhibit is one of the best I have seen. The mineral and precious stone exhibit was fascinating. I did not make it to even half of the exhibits as we only had 2 hours to spend here on an EF tour. That is definitely not enough time! I think you would need a full day to do it justice. They even offer overnight events for children and adults! Talk abut a real night at the museum!",Great day out
"May 8, 2019","Great for kids and adults, there's so much to see and do. Wish we'd had the whole day to wonder around and explore.",Superb exhibits and free to enter
"May 8, 2019","The only downside is that it was absolutely, critically PACKED full of people and you can't get near much.  This isn't their fault however and the quality of the exhibits deserve it a 5 star review.  The building is magnificent as well.",A must see in London
"May 8, 2019","Not just dinosaurs, but the story of our galaxy and planet and a warning about what is going to happen if we don't take care of it.The building is itself an art piece.",BIG and AWESOME
"May 8, 2019","There are lot to see in this Museum . Right from the Crawling creatures to Dinosaur . One can see rich history about all the living beings, fossils and Space. There are rides which one can experience.You need entire day and best part its free to visit which makes entire day event to have fun and to gain knowledge. ",No 1 place to see in London
"May 8, 2019","This place is just the best. Don;t forget to leave a generous donation to help keep this place going. My one recommmendation if you are going with kids is not to try and see everything. It's just too big and they'll get overloaded. Pick a few spots and have a good look at them and leave the rest. My highlights include the giant tree sample upstairs in the main room, the dinosaur exhibition and the geology samples",If you are a curious person
"May 8, 2019","There is so much to see here that I wish they extend the hours late into the night. My wife and I spent a good part of the day wandering amongst its huge halls to find wonders after wonders. Millienia-old trees, extinct animals, pre-historic meterites, etc..... Photos taken at the NHM are simply breath-taking as almost every exhibit make an incredible backdrop. Highly recommended.",Spectacular 
"May 8, 2019",Great free entertainment whilst in London. Suitable for all ages but caters in particular to children with interactive displays. Very interesting collections in a spectacular building. ,Top museum!
"May 7, 2019","Went on one of their evening events. Dinosaurs, experts, exhibits to touch and a drink if you feel like it. The rest of the museum was open too. Great place, lot's to see. Highly recommend.",So amazingly interesting! 
"September 13, 2016","This is such a cool museum! We didn't have much time, still spent over two hours here but didn't really make a dent, there are still many things I want to see! It was free and we saw dinosaur bones and a lot on the earths history. There was also a cool bit on memory and perception. We had to watch a video of a robbery and then they went back and asked different questions to see what we remembered! ",Totally Fantastic Visit. Great Coffee and indoor picnic area
"September 8, 2016","We cannot praise the Museum enough for a fantastic visit. Be prepared to queue, and if possible avoid school holiday times, it is still really busy but the queues are not unbearable. The best bits for us were of course the dinosaurs, the stairs, ( if you have visited before as a child you will know what I mean) the coffee in the small coffee shop, served by a very pleasant young man,, going up the escalator through earth was excellent and looked slightly surreal and finding the indoor picnic area,, which was a little oasis of calm, perfect for families on a tight budget as you can bring your own picnic and still enjoy all the facilities of the museum.",One of My Favourite Places in London
"September 8, 2016","History, Nature all under one roof. Best to visit in the winter (summer is a madhouse) - check what exhibits are on, and bring the whole family --- one of the best museums in the world within walking distance to so much ",Enjoyable
"September 8, 2016",This museum is very informative and would be a great place to take your kids! I went with my friends and really enjoyed it and acknowledged how enjoyable a child would find it! Free admission makes it a great day out as well as you don't have to worry about gathering costs.,Definite must-go if you have the time - worth the while
"September 5, 2016",Very extensive museum - probably need most of a day to visit it if you want to see everything. I would say this attraction should be a must-go if you are in London and have the time. Very extensive dinosaur collection - children absolutely love it. Beautiful building (recently modernised and extended too) and easy to get to by public transport (tube - South Kensington tube station/bus).,Great day
"September 4, 2016",It's free and informative some great artifacts to see and imagine yourselves submerged in the time when some of these things walked the earth. ,natural history museum
"September 2, 2016",oh my god what a fabulous day out and doesn't. cost anything to get in. A great day out loads to see for children and adults go its a must see. ,Absolutely  Awesome!
"August 31, 2016","From the moment you enter  and are greeted by  the amazing  dinosaur, you know you're  in for a real treat!  The recreations of the dinosaurs  and the other exhibits are astoundingly  good.  I loved photographing  in this museum, got some great shots.  It's a lot to see, so pace yourself.",What an amazing place for all ages
"August 30, 2016",What an amazing place for all ages. My kids enjoined from every minute in the museum and it's free. Dont miss it ,Go!  It's FREE!
"August 25, 2016",Crowded but FREE...how could you go wrong!  My kids especially loved it here with lots to see and look at!,Use the side entrance!
"August 24, 2016","We visited on a Sunday lunchtime and there were crowds spilling out of the tube station to get to the Museum. There were some museum guides advising to use the side entrance as there were no queues - and we walked straight in! Inside it was really busy, but we got some great pictures by the Diplodocus. We walked around the Dino exhibit just after 3pm and it was less crowded there. The animatronic T Rex was very noisy and a great watch. The human body exhibit was enjoyable, but some of the interactive parts were broken.The blue whale was impressive but it was too busy to see properly. My two children were quite taken with a very 80s interactive demo of how heat affects humans and camels.We will definitely return here, outside of school holidays when we can have a good look around with hopefully less crowds! We are so lucky to live in a country where gems like this museum are free for all to attend. ",Great place for 3- to 7 year-olds
"August 20, 2016","My kids love the NHM. The dinosaur skeletons, the mammal and bird galleries, the creepy-crawly and the all rest is just a big treat for young kids.  And it's free!  If you go there in the winter, you can also enjoy the ice-ring.  Highly recommended.",It is huge
"August 18, 2016",Don't plan to do anything else the same day as you come to this place because it is gigantic. Me and my husband spent 4 hours there and couldn't finish the whole thing. ,One of the Great Museums of the World
"August 18, 2016",This is one of the finest museums in the world. Filled with natural history exhibits that delight and surprize. The main hall is dominated by a skeleton of a huge dinosaur that somehow fits the architecture of the building. The dinosaur exhibit itself is filled with information and anamatronic displays that make you believe that you just stepped into the world of 75 million years ago. Modern day animals are not neglected either and the skeleton of a blue whale hanging over your head to give you a sense of the tremendous size of these creatures. A London must-see!,Worth a visit
"August 18, 2016","I recommend the visit even if you're not particularly interested in natural history: the building is awesome, both outside and inside. Admittance is free, we just had to stand in a queue for about 20 minutes, and it's high season. It's one of those huge museums you should visit more than once to see it all at ease, but if, like me, you're staying in London for a short holiday you need to walk around to have a general idea. Kids appreciate the section on dinosaurs very much, and the hall with the big mammals. For adults, I would recommend also going on the second floor to see the giant sequoia section and the ceiling decoration, then go down a few steps to the first floor, walk along the minerals rooms and stop at the end: in The Vault you can see diamonds, stones and meteorites.I liked also the animals in vases in the Darwin section.We were too tired to appreciate the section on human kind or to go out in the garden, next time.",Amazing day out with our three young boys! 
"August 16, 2016",What a great place! Our three very young lads had a ball.  We were there 6 hours! Very helpful friendly staff! There's something for everyone. Highly recommended. ,Great place and so much to see
"August 15, 2016","we visited mid week and so glad we got there when it opened , only had to wait 20 mins and in by 10:10 , got in the dinosaur bit and managed to get round a few areas before it started to fill up.Have to say we ate in the museum and was impressed with quality and price , same thing with the shop , plenty of things to buy that were not over priced . The queue when we left at midday was crazy so be warned and go as early as you can manage so worth it !!",Beautiful Building
"August 14, 2016",What a beautiful setting for a museum!  We spent hours wandering around and viewing the exhibits.  This is a very crowded venue so be prepared to wait in line to get in.  The exhibits were geared more for older children and adults.  Admission is free so you can't really complain.,Busy But A Must See
"August 14, 2016","I travelled here during February half term which I found out on the day is their busiest week in the year. If you want to avoid the queues, get there as close to 10am as possible and just be prepared for a bit of waiting around. We stayed for around 5 hours and only got around 1/3 of the museum, partly due to it being so busy but really down to the fact that it is just so vast. A fantastic and spell binding place, especially for the children. ",Beautiful museum
"August 11, 2016","The Natural History museum is in an incredible building which has tonnes of character. It was very busy when we visited, a bit too busy (about 1pm) would be best to go after 3pm to have the best experience. For a free museum it is well worth a visit. ",Fantastic and free
"April 14, 2016","With an impressive range of artefacts  on display, the museum is a must for all tourists. It is informative and educational but also highly interesting. Most importantly the museum is free of charge.",Gorgeous Building!
"April 13, 2016","The ""very good"" rating is primarily from the beauty of the building.  It's not any better than the Smithsonian or the one in New York, but it's great for kids.  It has a large, moving T-rex that I'm sure scares the pants off little kids.  Along with the architecture is the history in this place.  The information about Darwin, the do-do bird, feuds between explorers (intercepting artifacts as they were shipped to the UK!), and the general destruction of habitats by the explorers, is all fascinating (yet unfortunate) stuff.  ",Blast From The Past
"April 9, 2016","The Natural History Museum is the best museum in the world. There is so much to do and so much to see, for example: you can experience a mini earthquake, you can learn about the solar system, you can study Earth's rock formations, you can learn about reptiles,dinosaurs and sea creatures such as The Blue Whale, eat at the Museum's restaurant and enjoy the museum's souvenir shop and there is also a shop for the kids. I would recommend going early in the morning as there is no queue and you get to see more of the museum. Out of ten, I would rate it a ten.","Overcrowded, 3h queues, not worth it"
"April 7, 2016","Went to the museum on a Saturday morning, so expected it to be a bit crowded. Once we came to the museum entrance, we saw a massive queue, which we were told it was for the paid exhibition. Thinking that the normal queue will go faster, we decided to join the regular visitors queue. Worst mistake! We were standing outside in the rain and cold for nearly 3 hours. Once we got inside, it was impossible to move around or see any exhibits with the amount of people that were there! It create a massive congestion and it took us 30min to go from one section to another - ridiculous! I'm giving it 2* because the T-Rex and Kobe earthquake simulator were quite impressive. Other than that - the museum should really invest in either some policies to ease congestion or to update their website regularly saying whether it'll be a busy day or not.",An Incredible Museum!
"April 7, 2016","This is one of those museums that can ""touch"" even the heart of somebody who doesn't enjoy wandering inside such buildings. Dinosaurs, the beginning of earth, human body, space... this place has everything. Incredible collections of historical artefacts....exhibitions that will amaze you...!",Perhaps the greatest museum of natural history in the world!
"April 6, 2016","This beautiful museum, set in an awe-inspiring stone building is stunning inside and out! The collection of historical artefacts and wide range of exhibitions is impressive and the interactive exhibits (like the earthquake demonstration) are fun and informative for all ages. Look out for the dinosaurs!",Amazing
"April 5, 2016",The museum is outstanding! There's so many things to see and learn. It takes more than one day to visit all the compartments. I definitely recomend this museum which is for all ages! It's a must!,It has Dinosaurs - what else is there to say? It has lots of other stuff!
"April 5, 2016",The museum itself is an amazing piece of architecture. The dinosaurs themselves do not occupy a vast amount of the space but they get you in and then there are so many other things to see.And it has a café so relax with a sandwich and a beer (they also sell coffee etc.).,A wonderful experience if you like natural history
"April 5, 2016","This museum is filled up with dinosaur skeletons, real bugs (not alive), fossils, a full size blue whale figurine (they're big!), animals, fishes, specimens in jars - it was amazing. No live animals inside the museum. Get there early, there is a long queue to get in, and from noon to about three PM, when we were there, there's a lot of other people there, so despite the building being huge, some areas (especially the dinosaur part) felt really crowded. Sometimes, you can even see scientists doing real work at the labs around the museum. There's also a part where, if you're lucky, you can ask the scientists questions about what  they're doing through a microphone, but, sadly, they were working somewhere else the day we were there. Suits both children and grown-ups alike - we went there as a 30+ couple with no kids, and we had a great time. ",Solar system exhibition
"April 4, 2016",Went to see the photographic exhibition on our solar system currently running - amazing photographs but Brian Eno's accompanying music a bit disappointing. ,"""Must be"" London attraction"
"March 15, 2016",so much to see also some interactive parts. Entry is free but a small donation is appreciated (and definitely worth!).,Excellent day out! 
"March 12, 2016","I'm 26 years old and came for a day out with my friend. Simply had to experience it and I wasn't disappointed! Loved every second. There's so much to look at I'd definitely recommend going first thing in the morning. Queues can be long but we got inside within 40 mins. Lots of history, animals, dinosaurs, biology and more! Food in the restaurant was also excellent! Loved my day here! ",Incredible
"March 11, 2016","Went to London for 2 nights, tried to squeeze in this place in the morning before our flight. Needs a full day in my opinion, incredible place. So many amazing exhibits, will go back down to spend my full day there. Love it.",Worth visiting
"March 11, 2016","All the 3 major museums are just nearby each other, must visit all - Victoria and albert museum, science museum and natural museum - would highly recommend it.",Great Free Attraction
"March 11, 2016",My daughter loves Dinosaurs and the fact that the museum was close by to where we stay was a bonus. Wished we had spent more time here. with kids you have to be able to spend the whole day here. ,London Holiday Great visit to natural History Museum
"March 10, 2016","Though New York will always be my favorite, London's NHM is a great visit and not to be missed.   Great restaurant, coffee shop and gift shops as well as exhibits.",Awesome!
"March 8, 2016",Seriously not to be missed. Amazing dinosaur exhibit. No excuse not to go. One of the best science museums in the world. ,Great day

"March 4, 2016","I came here with my boyfriend as he wanted to look at all the dinosaurs, we only looked at that part and was very interesting and loved the realistic animatronic T-Rex! Only took about an hour or so to walk around where all the dinosaurs/animals were but we did have to queue for a while to get in but you can't really complain as it's free! We did buy a map for £1.It was rather overcrowded in some places but guess it's a city so you're going to get that.",Go check it out - it's free!
"March 4, 2016","I finally went to see Natural History Museum. I especially enjoyed the dinosaurs, big mammals & human sections. This is such a huge museum - so be prepared to walk a lot.","So much to see,and its free."
"June 9, 2016","Great place to go,with kids or without and best of all its free admission.You need to leave yourself a day to see everything as there is so much to see and do.There are heaps of eating places inside with a variety of food choices.Get there when the doors open,get yourself a map and enjoy a wonderful museum.",For the kids
"June 5, 2016","This is a fairly old fashioned museum and, while it is probably worth the visit with kids, as an adult, I would definitely not queue to visit again.",Great museum
"June 3, 2016","We went on a busy holiday weekend. We were pleased with the quality and amount of attractions, small line, and cost (free!!). Definitely make time to see ancient artifacts!",Building or the artifacts--which is more amazing?
"June 3, 2016","Awesome, awesome awesome.Not sure if the artifacts or the building is most impressive.Fossils, taxidermy, full animal and dino replicas & skeletons, etc. Also has a first edition of ""Origen of species""  Thank you Charley D!",Outstanding museum with an amazing dinosaur collection 
"May 31, 2016","My family and I visited the Natural History Museum on the May Bank Holiday Weekend.This is a fantastic museum for both kids and adults alike. The dinosaur collection is excellent, and they also have a roaring, moving T Rex!There is a comprehensive mammal section including a huge whale. There is also an escalator through the earth to levels including an earthquake simulator.All the above are free. There are also a number of additional exhibitions that incur a charge. We went to the butterfly exhibition (live butterflies in a tent) which cost £22 for a family ticket. It's a little pricey for what it is, but everyone thoroughly enjoyed. If you live in London there are some membership options that are reasonably priced and provide access to the paid exhibits, queue jump entry and 10 passes to give to friends and family to have free access to all the chargeable exhibits. Overall this is one of the best museums I have ever visited and I heartily recommend it to all, and especially if you have kids who like dinosaurs. ",Disappointing visit
"May 29, 2016","Went back to the natural history museum after a 15 year gap and was very sad to see that most of the exhibitions haven't been modernised or refreshed with the most up to date information on subjects. Many of the interactive displays were incredibly old and dated and were from the 80/90'sHowever we did take a behind the scenes tour which was fantastic, showing preservation methods preserved fish/Mammals including a 15ft squid along with Darwin's personal collection.General facilities of the museum were good with the cafes offering decent food.",Very suitable for children
"May 27, 2016","Excellent museum with an exhibition about dinosaurs (there is a full size model of the T-Rex), stuffed animals and minerals.",Natural History Meuseam
"May 27, 2016",Good for the kids. It has a dino section. I recommend you bring the kids there. On Exibition Road and Cromwell Road.,Best ever museum
"May 25, 2016","To start with, it's a stunning building. If you have children then you owe it to them to visit the dinosaurs. Not just skeletons (awe inspiring as the are) but animated T Rex! Thrilling for all. Just an adult? Then explore the educational stuff - human history is a must see. The other good thing is that there are really good places to eat, varied menu, inexpensive and plenty of room. When you're absolutely exhausted but educated you can head for nearby Kensington Gardens for rest.",FREE to do in London. Great for dinosaur lovers.
"May 24, 2016","If you are a fan of dinosaurs this is a must see! There is a exhibition soley dedicated to dinosaurs. It is full of interesting facts for adults too and not just for children. There are real dinosaur bones as well as models and animated models. There are also plenty of models you can touch -models of dino teeth, skulls and tusks. I Particularly enjoyed the mammal exhibition with stuffed animals(not as creepy as it sounds) and huge model of a blue whale. Very educational in a fun way.  ",Another massive museum. Spend a day here.
"April 18, 2016",Great museum that has alot going for it. Make sure you visit the vault at the top floor to see some of the most rare and beautiful precious stones in the world. You come out of here with a massive appreciation for the natural world and this place is so big you could probably spend a week going about it and still not see everything.  Brilliant for large groups as well as the entrance is free. Just make sure you have some way of identifying them in the large crowds.  Well worth a visit.,First visit
"April 17, 2016",Excellently laid out exhibitions with activities. This is a place for the whole family as there is something for all ages. Learnt things about dinosaurs I never knew before.,The Place To Go - Anytime Any Age
"April 17, 2016",Went to the Natural History Museum yesterday and came in particular to see the dinosaur exhibition and we were not disappointed! Absolutely amazing! The building and architecture are an added bonus. Breathtaking and a piece of art in its own right. Went to the mammal section too. It was good and educational but maintenance of the area appeared pretty poor.,Quick trip but excellent destination
"April 17, 2016",The NHM is great for adults or children. I am a biologist and couldn't pass up a visit. The main Hall is beautiful in itself and the displays are breath taking. ,Very interesting and informative
"April 17, 2016","The Natural History Museum's collections were built over centuries so there is a lot to see, give yourself several hours for a visit. This is a good activity for older children too. This is one of my favorite museums in the world, and I visit nearly every time I come to London.",Rainy day exploration
"April 16, 2016",This beautiful building houses an enormous amount of historical items.  You could wander around all day in there and not see everything.  Pick 2 sections and really immerse yourself in the time periods to get the full effect.,"So much to see and do, for free!"
"April 16, 2016","The Natural History Museum is in a beautiful building housing many taxidermy and model animals, exhibits, a dinosaur section and so much more.  You can spend hours exploring and learning here.  It is free so be prepared, there will probably be a queue.",Very exciting and nice museum.  Worth a visit if you have kids but great for adults too.
"April 15, 2016","We went when it was a bank holiday and the lines at the entrance were long.  However, worth every second of that wait.  Amazing exhibits and very helpful and friendly staff inside if you happen to get lost :)  Beautiful architecture too !",Going the Darwin route
"April 15, 2016","There is so many positives from this visit, I don't even know where to start.I was there for watching two photo exhibitions, but ended up being in the dino section.The queues are endless, meaning you should be there before 11.00.I bought a ticket in a booth not far away from the adjacent tube station. This meant I could walk past the endless queue, and enter the museum with no fuss whatsoever.Great experience. Will definately be back.",A nice place!
"April 14, 2016","I really liked this museum, mainly because of the dinosaurs, but they had alot of other cool stuff there too, alot of whales and underwater animals showed in their real size which was pretty impressive, and alot of rocks too. The only minus was the queues, but i mean.. Thats what you have to expect on these places",Great day out
"February 17, 2016","What a place the kids loved it having a boy who is a big dinosaur fan this is the place to visit so much to see,leave a couple of hours to see everything and get there early as it gets very busy.",Amazing Place to Visit!
"February 16, 2016","Absolutely breath taking building! Amazing features and statues of different creatures! Brilliant stuff for a free museum, high recommend you attend if and when you are ever in London, learned alot while I was there and took loads of photos! :)",Fantastic place
"February 15, 2016",Fantastic place to go really enjoyed it had hours of fun they're seeing the history of evolution and everything really great fun would recommend,Needed 2 days to see it all!!
"February 14, 2016","Wow what a place I've never seen anything like it on this scale. The building alone is a wonder to behold absolutely stunning architecture, the inside is just as breathtaking as the outside. For this I will overlook the loooooong queue to get in!! In all seriousness it was long, but moved quickly. It was well orchestrated in order to avoid bottle necking. Upon entry you cannot help but marvel at the sheer enormity of the place, especially when you are presented with the bones of a Diplodocus standing front and centre of the main entrance hall. We visited the dinosaur exhibit first, again there was a queue that moved quickly however the volume of people visiting meant the walk through felt more like IKEA on a Saturday so you couldn't really take it in, but it was impressive nonetheless. Our Dinosaur obsessed 3 year old was totally captivated so that's a plus!!There were a lot of really good exhibits, but my personal favourite was the large Mars like planet that had an escalator running through it, with huge expansive walls covered in constellations it really was impressive. There are plenty of places to sit down which is welcomed for the size of the place, there are also ample places for you to purchase food and gifts. We went on the first Sunday before half term so it was busy in London in general but as long as you expect that you should have a great time. ",Superb exhibits but what a stunning building
"February 13, 2016",Had a flying visit here earlier this week & would highly recommend it to others. The building is absolutely outstanding & the exhibits fantastic. Well worth a look.,Wonderful experience through the beauty of our world
"February 10, 2016",I use to visit the Museum once a year in combination with the exhibition of the wildlife photographer of the year. I feel always attracted by the different aspects of the nature that are collected and visible in the museum from the ancient marine reptiles fossils extremely well preserved to the tiny birds that often are we shown on beautiful paintings. The photo exhibition is also a great opportunity to not miss!,A Must See for Anyone Visiting London
"February 4, 2016","It's big, it's extensive, it's interesting and it's free. Go and take a picture with the Giant Sloth. Bump into (not literally) a terror from the past, those oh-so-extinct dinolizards. And then just marvel at the amount of exhibits on different fields of natural sciences.Just go there and wander around. You won't be disappointed.",Geweldig!
"January 30, 2016",Really good museum. if you are travelling with children its a good oportunity to do something intersting for them and dont need to pay entrance. Take your time at this place because has a lot to see. Have fun!,Must see
"January 23, 2016",Absolutely amazing and well worth visiting. Could have spent three times longer in there than we actually did.The stewards at the entrance were a bit pushy for donations but the exhibits were well worth the small cost.,One museum you have to go to!
"January 19, 2016","If there is but a museum you can go to, this is the museum to go to! Especially if you like dinosours!",really good and educating
"November 16, 2015","I really enjoyed walking round and seeing the different types of animals, dinosaurs, the way of life and nature. however I must say that when it got to getting in to the museum we had to que for half an hour because we had to have bag searches, which I didn't mind but It was raining and cold! also the food was very very expensive it was £5.00 for a ham and cheese baguette my partner had to go without having food because he didn't want to pay that when you could get the same from another shop! all in all the museum was really good and I would go back!",Best museum ever visited!
"November 7, 2015","This museum has everything if you are interested in biology and science in general. They are currently working on the skeleton of a blue whale, can't wait to see that once finished. ",Too big? Best for dinosaurs lovers.
"November 3, 2015","This is first of all a great and beautiful building, inside and out.It has so many interesting things to see that you can easily spend a hole day there! And this can be a problem when you're in this amazing city that is London. It's mostly about minerals and animals: the Human specie, other living creatures and of course the Dinosaurs. It's free and has a lot of interesting things for kids.",Go when (if ever) you can avoid the crowds ...
"November 2, 2015","Having just arrived in England after a long stretch in France and having no idea that the English kids were on school holidays I ambled off to the Natural History Museum mainly because I was staying nearby for some days.The queues to get in from the start of the day were stupendous!  It was the dawning of the knowledge that it was school holiday time. Enthusiastic kids of all ages, including quite young ones,  had arrived with parents in tow (I think that is the right way to put it) and I was aghast at first at the idea of queuing and then milling inside with so many little ones.However it was quite an eye-opening experience on a number of points:  firstly the 'crowd-control' security staff had the whole process well in-hand.  We were informed of progress, staff kept kids amused, the English parents and littlies as well as older children showed remarkable patience and perseverance and lost none of their enthusiasm at all.Secondly, I was astonished at the sheer excitement of and interest of all the kids, from really quite young children to high-school aged ones too.  It was an experience in itself to watch the utter delight of parents and kids together, especially in the Dinosaurs sections.The Museum itself was worth the queuing for me as it was a most interesting, surprising and extensive display on many themes and areas of research and learning.Do not miss the Room of Treasures!  Allow a full day - you can get a reasonable meal there!",A fun way to spend a few hours
"November 2, 2015",I made the mistake of visiting the museum on a wet day in the last week of the summer holidays. The line to get in was long. It took approximately 45 minutes to get in.I enjoyed the museum. I did cut my time short because of the kids. It was too busy for me to relax and fully enjoy it.,awesome
"October 30, 2015",AWESOME....and free....is huge ..nice ... impossible to get bored. i advice everyone  if possible to visit during the week time  and  avoid weekends  as is crazy busy ....i was impressed  and i am not the type of person who enjoy museums in general ... but this one love it .. spend about 3 hrs inside  and was a general visit . if u pay attention to everything will be like 5 hr visit i think,"Fun, educational, and free!"
"October 28, 2015","This is an absolute must visit! I've been with many friends and family who have visited (ages between 19-50 somethings - but would be a great outing with children as well), all of whom have given it rave reviews. The museum is well laid out with a range of exhibits. However, it can get quite busy on weekends so if possible, I suggest going during the week days. The museum is directly in front of the South Kensington tube station so very easy access and is next door to the Science museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum so you can make a day of it, if you like. There is also plenty of outdoor space if you want to have your lunch outside.","Educational, fun & well put together"
"October 27, 2015","This is a delight for anyone with a passion for finding out about our beginnings. We very happily spent nearly an entire day pottering around and only left when we did because we needed to catch the train home!It's busy & popular because the UK has this wonderful concept of making museums free to enter thus ensuring that everyone has equal access. There were plenty of kids in there having a great time (except one who was terrified of the dinosaurs) and they were learning at the same time - brilliant! The museum has bins for donations, and if you visit, please do consider donating to enable them to keep doing what they do so wonderfully. We all benefit from them.",Dinosaur Hunting
"October 27, 2015",Took our 4.5 year old little boy on his first trip to London to see Dippy and he wasn't disappointed. The museum is as fantastic as I remembered it we only saw a small part of it as its a long day for a 4 year old and there is a lot of walking involved. the exhibits were great. we will be coming back you need to leave a good 1.5hrs just to do the dinosaurs. be prepared to queue to get in at busy times but it's well worth it just to see the look of amazement on your child's face when the first see dippy the diplodocus in the entrance. A must do with your kids,A must
"October 26, 2015",A fabulous building with exhibits that could have kept me there for days!! The geological section alone took over half my allocated time. Just so much to see & children will love the dinosaur sections. A further visit will be necessary....,Exciting experience
"August 25, 2015",This museum is closest to experiencr a real tryst with some of the extinct species. It is well maintained and is absolutely free for tourists. It is a must go if you are in London no matter how old are you.,Great time out
"August 23, 2015","I visited the Natural History Museum as a recommendation from a friend, and it did not disappoint. I was travelling solo so I was able to go at my own pace and enjoy. There is a lot to see. I first went in the morning and it was already busy being summer. If you are going in peak season allow a good half a day to see everything. The fact that this place is free to go to is even more a reason to go.",Brill museum
"August 19, 2015",This is a brilliant museum. A full day with so much to see for people of all ages. I would visit again. ,Natural History Museum
"August 16, 2015","I last went to the museum quite a few years ago. It was brilliant.Today, however I found it very disappointing.If you want to see the dinosaurs, you have to queue for a very long time. Then you are pushed and shoved along a raised gangway without having time to stop and look at anything. It`s like sheep being led to their slaughter.Most of the rooms were just filled with infant school style education boards. You don`t really get to see anything unless you go into the basement to the education centre and use the microscopes which are good fun.Would I go back again ? Probably not if they are going to keep it like this.",Butterfly experience was wonderful!
"August 14, 2015",After visiting the nearby Victoria and Albert Museum and the Science Museum we on our way to the tube station when we saw the signs for the Butterfly tent next to the Natural History Museum. The butterflies were beautiful with a huge variety in colour and size and it was impossible to smile. It was a wonderful surprise!,Don't miss the building itself!
"August 13, 2015","This really is a treasure.  The dinosaur exhibit in particular is really well done.  Get there early to avoid the crowds.  While you're there, don't forget to look at the building itself - adorned with intricate carvings of animals and a beautiful sight to behold as a structure.",Best Natural History Museum in the World
"August 10, 2015",Huge museum with many exhibits regarding the geological and biological history of our earth. Haven't seen a natural museum that is bigger and provides that many things to see. Definitely a must go for any London visitors!,Don't be Afraid of the Queue!  You'll Love Your Experience!
"August 9, 2015","When we first saw the queue, we thought our day's plans were dashed.  The line snaked back and around and up and sideways . . . but when we noticed that it continually moved, we decided to give it a shot.   . . .  And my 14 year old son and I were thrilled we did.  What a tremendous place!! And it really only took about 15 or 20 minutes before we were inside exploring!!   I think those managing the New York City Natural History Museum should come take a few lessons.  Everything works here in London!  The interactive bits for children are just right, encouraging thought and playfulness. . . .  but they never overpromise.  The variety of exhibits is tremendous.  We especially loved the experience of the earthquake and volcano exhibits!!   But perhaps the highlight was the photography exhibit.  This annual exhibit of wildlife photographs was breathtaking.  I will never forget the beauty and color of those images.   This particular exhibit may be a once-a-year thing but it seems that there are special exhibits of the sort all the time.  I have been to London many many times but this visit to Natural History Museum was the first.  It won't be the last!",Worth visiting
"August 9, 2015","This is a museum that has something for everyone unlike the more specialised museums. There are loads of different and varied displays laid out by a grouping system of collections. The museum gets quite busy during the day and can even have a queue before opening but certainly the earlier the better. Admission is free. Overall, given the variety of objects on display and the free admission, this is well worth visiting for all the family.",Good option of museum
"August 8, 2015","Great place, interesting things to see!! For sure, a good option to do in London. The entrance is also free.",An armadillo as big as a room and the architecture takes your breath away.
"August 7, 2015",Visit for the building and architecture.  Amazing and the exhibits take your breath away.  This is a must.  You will never be in another building like this.  Incredible and beautiful. ,Excellent Human Biology Section
"August 6, 2015","We approached this museum with the goal of seeing things we could not see at a natural history museum in the US, and it delivered.  The section that focused on human biology was especially good.  It was fun to see a couple of exhibits that would never have made it past the Moral Standards Police in America.  I also liked seeing an early copy of Darwin's ""Origin of Species"".  This is a very good museum that really deserved a whole day.",Worth the wait.
"August 5, 2015",It was our second visit to the NHM and thus we were better prepared.1) expected the queue (as start of summer break - although an hour was longer than we expected).2) Better to do 1 (ideal) or 2 halls properly and still have your senses together at the end of it.3) we divided up to 2 parties (dinosaurs and minerals) to enjoy it more.A wonderful morning which ended with us all still talking (to eachother) at the end of the visit. An excellent museum with a first class pedigree.,Amazing Place
"August 4, 2015","If you have children who are able to walk and have a curious nature, this is THE place to visit. The kids 9 and 4 year olds, loved everything. The dinosaurs were amazing as was the butterfly exhibit. If you are going make sure you plan what you'll be doing, there is an app which I highly recommend you download before you visit. Really good day out.",Great for the whole family
"August 3, 2015","We visited the first thing in the morning, arriving about a half hour before opening, and there was a line - 10 minutes before opening the line was getting pretty long. We going to leave for Paris that afternoon so we knew that we would need to have an abbreviated visit, but we did very well - we entered through the Exhibition Road entrance (as opposed to the Cromwell Road entrance where you see the large dinosaur skeleton in the Central Hall right away). We entered in to the Earth Hall, going up an escalator that passed through a large red display that feels like you are passing through the earth's core. One of our attractions in this area was the display on volcanoes and earthquakes. I had heard about the earthquake simulator and really wanted to try it. It is essentially a display of a store in Kobe, Japan that simulates an earthquake. The floor moves, the items on the shelving shakes. It was interesting, but it is not an amusement ride. I really enjoyed the Treasures section and if you are short on time, make sure you do this. It is 22 specially selected objects that are either unique, valuable, famous or surprising. A rare dodo skeleton, the first Neanderthal skull discovered, a rare first edition of Darwin's On the Origin of the Species, one of the three penguin eggs brought back from the Antarctic by Captain Scott's expedition. We saw the giant sequoia in the second floor landing. It is a massive slice taken from one of the world's largest trees. I was interested in going to Vault at the end of the minerals gallery - it showcases the most precious specimens from the museum's mineralogy collections. There is the historic Latrobe nugget from the Australian gold rush, meteorites rom Mars and the moon, etc. My teenage son was fascinated with the mammals section. There is a huge blue whale model on display which is really awesome. In various sections one gets to see dinosaur remains (including the central hall) - we knew that we were not going to have the time to do the dinosaur exhibit which includes the animatronic T-Rex. We had to make a decision - either see a lot of the rest of the museum, or spend a fair bit of our precious time in the long line up. We had been to the New York and Washington Natural History Museums, we had certainly seen our share of dinosaur displays, and we were content with the dinosaur remains we saw elsewhere in the museum. Finally the building itself is lovely and is a marvel in itself. It is a huge museum, hard to do in one visit, you do get worn out after a while -  2-3 hours is my limit in a museum. Even though we did see a lot, we know there is so much more. One final note: the admission is free to the permanent exhibits, there are fees for temporary exhibits.",The story of our world under one roof!
"July 30, 2015","its so huge so make sure you plan for what you want to see, if not you will be missing lots of its valuable contents.i visited with my family, but its not always wise to do so because you don't want to wait for each and every one to follow you so you may need to decide on a meeting spot then every one find his own way.even though one day will not be enough to get around it so keep it on your agenda for a second visit later.some modern parts might be more attractive for kids than history so let them find there way.",Loved it 
"July 29, 2015",Absolutely loved this especially cause it was free only downside was the queue to get in and to get in to see the dinosaurs was very busy and wasn't nice walking along the bridge with all those people and was very warm in there but overall a gd day out  ,"Beautiful Museum, Amazing for kids, overcrowded at some times"
"July 29, 2015","We went to the Natural history Museum on a Tuesday morning (Thinking that it would not be so crowded). To our surprise, there was a HUGE line-up to go in (About 30 minutes wait.) We were told that if we made a small donation (8 pounds), we can get the butterfly tickets and skip the line to go straight in. We tried that and we were in no time. The Dinosaurs exposition was really breath taking especially for the kids. But again we were stuck in a line-up inside and it took us at least 20 minutes to get out of the Dinosaurs exposition. The Butterfly experience was so exciting for the kids. Just seeing all these beautiful insects flying around us made the kids super excited. Definitely worth spending a day at the Museum. It is both Fun and Educational.",Another Museum-Naturally!
"July 25, 2015",Had a lovely time venturing around and there are many hands on activities-don't forget to bring your hand sanitizer as you will need it after your visit to this place...lots to see worth coming along a couple of times to allow you to see it all.,A long wait followed by a long wait 
"July 24, 2015",I would suggest avoiding the museum in the school holidays unless you get there first thing in the morning . I arrived with my family and had to wait over 2 hours just to be let in the door . Then when inside we had to wait in line again to see the dinosaurs . Lovely and interesting museum but will never go during the holidays again . ,"please go.....dont hesitate..fab, fab, fab!"
"June 9, 2015","Impressive, informative, exciting and fun. Such an enjoyable time spent in this beautiful building, my daughter,  7yr old grandson and myself had a wonderful time here. The exhibits are so impressive and everythinfs laid out in such a way you really are learning all the time. Taking an escalator through the centre of the earth, standing in a shop and experiencing an earthquake and being roared at by a dinosaur are just some of the memories that will stay with me always.....and all free.....fabulous a must for all the family, pkease go.",Dont take away the Dinosaur!!!!
"June 8, 2015","Visited recently with my dinosaur loving kids, will be terrible if they take away the main dinosaur exhibit to replace it with a whale.Great stuff to see, for kids and adults alike, exhibits changing all the time, so can visit often.",Great and free museum!
"June 8, 2015","We went to this museum twice as we did not have enough time first time around to see everything it has to offer. It's a great place for kids of all ages as well as for adults. Lots of different exhibits! Free entrance, however, some exhibitions could be for a fee. It can get very crowdy as well as schools tend to bring students there for day trips. For that reason I would recommend going there in the afternoon towards the end of the day, but be aware that they are open until 5.50 pm and you probably going to need at least 2 hours to get through most things.",One of the best Natural History museums in the world 
"June 7, 2015","It has an impressive collection of skeletons, reproductions and stuffed animals, including one of the most impressive dinosaur collections in the world. The dinosaur in the main hall alone is worth the visit (which is free). ",Should be on your Bucketlist
"June 5, 2015","An absolute must visit. If you went to the UK and only been to that museum, it would have made your trip worthwhile.Free entrance, cafe and restaurant available at the location, takes half a day to tour it.",The walls are alive with the sound of living!
"June 4, 2015","This remarkable building is a testament to the brilliance and vision of the best of Victorian adventure and architecture ! With free admission it has to be one of the best experiences in London for you and your family. Crammed with an incredibly diverse collection it juxtaposes its complex terracotta tiles entwining stone lizards and birds with life size dinasours and state of the art digital displays. As an institution it has come a long way academically , abandoning its 19th century reputation of being a place dominated by appointments made by gentlemanly favouri it now sparks thinking , investigation and occasionally fear! Just check the 5 year old encountering the 32m long Diplodocus Carnegie skeleton for the first time or the Anti-evolutionist coming across the marble Statue of  Darwin in the corridor! With regularly changing exhibitions this great institution never loses its sparkle and synthesises a certain kind of spirit and endeavour that apparently we never lost. No excuses- visitor or Londoner- get down there with the fam !",Natural history lives in London

AND IT WAS FOR FREE!",Massive museum
"May 30, 2015",We went to the NHM during half term break and luckily we got there early as there was a long line forming right when it opened. This place is massive and the architecture of the building itself was incredible. I wish we would have had more time in the museum and wish it wasn't as busy so we could have enjoyed it more. Would definitely go back and its FREE!!,"Beautiful Museum, Amazing for kids, overcrowded at some times"

"July 24, 2015","I wouldn't recommend going during the summer as it gets very hot and crowded. Yes admission is free but you will pay dearly for anything else especially food. Lines for anything interesting and many of the displays look straight out of the 70s....many don't work properly, are missing, or are completely broken. We wanted to see the famous dodo but he is all covered up along with most of the birds as they are redoing the exhibit....which is good but why at the height of tourist season? They should redo the bug hall instead anyway. Special butterfly exhibit was nice but cost way too much for tickets. Sorry if this sounds bitter but there are so many better free museums in London to visit.",Darwin Lives
"July 23, 2015","If you like natural history, this is the place to go.   Not so interested?  Still a good visit because 1.  it's free, and 2. you can pick as much or as little as you like.  A nice tearoom and a GREAT shop.  All sorts of things for kids, plus a lot of attractive items for grownups.   Some made in China, but hey.  Prices are a wee bit high, but I suppose some of it goes to science?",Fabulous but avoid the queues by using side entrance off exhibition road!
"July 22, 2015",Being school summer holidays it was very busy with families and tourists etc surprised at lack of air conditioning... It was very hot and busy for families with young children.Blue section zone is where the dinosaurs are & was by far the most crowded area. Restless earth however was fascinating including an earthquake simulator of the Kobe earthquake! ,Natural History Museum
"July 22, 2015","Favourite building, museum and exhibitions for families in my opinion. Natural History Museum can be visited again and again, all ages and never gets dull; best of British.",Fantastic and free!
"July 21, 2015",The museum was full of wonderful things to look at and read about from dinosaurs to volcanoes. you can spend hours just wandering about this magnificent building.We had the added bonus of being able to visit the butterflies on display in the gardens which wasn't free but worth the fee.Do make sure small children like butterflies flying around as many ended up screaming once inside and had to be taken out.,If you have kids you have to bring them here.
"July 21, 2015","Its one of those places that everyone should go and see at least once and if you have kids then its a must. Get there early as the Que starts early to get in. My kids loved the dinosaurs but there is so much to see and do you can walk the feet of yourself and see more stuff than you can possibly take in.Entry is free but some of the exhibitions you have to pay for in advance so check before you go, but there is well enough to see and do for people of any age.",Top 5 museums

"May 23, 2015", Must for scientists and children. It should take at least 2-3 hours to see dinos and others.Also a building is impressive.,Incredible experience
"May 20, 2015","First time at the museum and I was amazed at the scale of the place. Everything is free except the exhibitions, and they only ask for donation. By getting the membership, not only you but also your families and friends would be able to view any exhibitions for free throughout the year. There are lots of displays in different zones, and they're all so interesting that you can spend hours in the museum without realizing it! They're informative and interactive, so it's great for families. Since the coral exhibition's main purpose is to send out a message to save the coral reef, it might not be as amazing as other areas in the museum. I love the fish tank at the end though! I would recommend going on weekdays as it can get really crowded on weekends and you'd have to wait in line to get in.",Nice for the kids 
"May 19, 2015",Great for kids.  Lots of activities for diffrent ages coffee shops are a bit pricy so take a pack lunch. ,Visit to the most beautiful building
"May 7, 2015",After a long queue to get in the kids were full of life and we feel to young to enjoy really as getting in is just the beginning of the queues.  Maybe try late in the day as they loved seeing all the moving dinosores But from an adult point if view the building itself is just amazing and filled with amazing facts.  Wonderful place to visit,Amazingly interesting and more than a days information!
"April 29, 2015",Displays interesting and so much to see. Amazing building and extensive displays. Could easily spend a couple of days here. Catering extremely expensive so bring own refreshment or come well fed!,Amazing adventures amongst the dinosaurs.
"April 27, 2015",Taking the Tube to South Kensington links you with a large tunnel to the two museums. If it is busy you will snake you way to the entrance. Check before you go if is school holidays as it may include s wait to get in. Allow plenty of time to view the extensive visits. Visit T Rex first. It may involves queues but it is worth it. The panels of explanations gives a good foundation for other exhibits. If your interests are of the natural work there is ample to see from around the world.,Very VERY interesting!
"April 26, 2015",From the moment you enter the museum you uderstand how interesting it is! Many different sections for every taste and if you have plenty of time you can visit everything! (i mean A LOT OF TIME!). Loved it!,Wonderful!
"April 23, 2015","Lots of good exhibits, especially if you enjoy natural history. Lots of interactive things as well. On our way out, one of the docents suggested we take the lift to the upper level, mainly for the view. He was right. It was wonderful. Later, we thanked him, and got ushered to another part of the museum which, during WWII, was blocked off for secret espionage work. That was as fascinating as the exhibits. So talk with the docents. They're amazingly knowledgeable, and seem to love what they do. The museums in London are free, which is remarkable ... but seriously consider leaving a donation wherever you go. Maintaining these beautiful old buildings is costly, I'm sure ... not to mention maintenance of the exhibits.","Out of date, overpriced and over crowded."
"April 19, 2015","This place has really fallen behind compared to London's other attractions. It's a bit like my grandads attic - lots of interesting things but dusty, old and out of date. Yes ok the entry is free, but once you are in you are herded around like sheep, stand in queues and made to pay stupidily high prices for food and drinks. Not all the exhibits are free - to see the 'reef' it's 60 quid for a family and really not worth it. The place needs closing and refurbishing and a new system put in place so that people can visit without having to climb over each other. Very dissapointing. Avoid.",Disappointing
"July 14, 2015",I've always wanted to go here but I left disappointed. The museum itself is a magnificent building and we didn't have to queue long to get in. Unfortunately inside it is uncomfortably warm and extremely busy so it was impossible to get close to many exhibits. I was looking forward to seeing the original dinosaur fossils but many were just plaster casts. The exhibits are predominantly aimed at children which of course is great for the kids but not so much the adults. For the size of the building I expected to see a lot more items on display. There were extra displays you could pay to see - we didn't mainly because of the heat and it seemed unlikely they'd be any better.,The best museum for kids
"July 14, 2015","You can't get bored of this museum, especially of you have kids, the location is surrounded with museums and all of them got something special to see, defiantly a must for all London visitors.",Amazing pizza!
"July 13, 2015","Whilst on a visit to the Natural History Museum we realised we hadn't stopped for lunch so decided to grab a pizza to share from the restaurant with a couple of drinks. The pizza was made to order and tasted delicious, definitely a good choice. Don't hesitate to eat here! We were very impressed. ",This musem will blow your mind!
"July 12, 2015","Museum has very easy access through the tube which when you leave you can see the breathtaking outside view of the building. It has an enormous amount of exhibitions and even if you are small or big, you will find this place fascinating!- Plan a day or maybe two days visit, you may see all the exhibitions in approx. 4-5 hours but by walking really quick- Take a small map with you at the entrance, it will be helpfull- Get informed a day before for anything special going on from the musem's website, you might find it interesting- Try keeping track of where you've been and not as you might miss something- Since this is one the most famous museum's of London, arm yourself with patience, you will see a lot of people and maybe wait a lot as well in the lines- Very reliable and free Wi-Fi- Before you leave don't forget to visit the museum's store, very nice items",The BEST
"July 10, 2015",Went there with my sister and spent the whole day there! it has everything you want and is divided into sections so you get to choose your particular interest. Believe me each section is worth a visit. Loved everything about that museum. will be going there again for sure. BTW no entry fee for the museum!!,"Wonderful place, never long enough to see it."
"July 6, 2015","Went specifically to see the Coral Reefs exhibition which was excellent. Very informative and lots of visual guides. Great tank of live coral and fish. Food video about the reefs problems due to climate change and fishing, and pollution.","Dinosaurs, fleas and rocks"
"July 2, 2015","This was my 10 year old sons big treat - dinosaurs, lunch, the darwin centre (which is fabulous) and the wildlife garden complete with wild bees, rocks and minerals (a room missed by most, also quiet and relaxing) and apart from the food and drink it was free.Top tips: get there early, out of holiday season, from victoria station by tube not bus (takes ages) and get a taxi back when you are worn out. Also check your bags into the luggage dept. so you can relax. Eat at the darwin centre (less noise and queuing).","Its free, whats there to complain about?"
"July 2, 2015",I've been here numerous times and it never ceases to be interesting. Some of the exhibits are getting a little dated (the insects and creepy crawlies) but overall as it is free you can't really complain.If you need the toilet don't use the one right by the entrance there are plenty inside which aren't as busy!,Crowded
"July 1, 2015",Went with my family and it was packed. Staff were directing crowds - not that there was anywhere to go. People were crammed into small exhibition rooms and were unable to move forward or backwards as a result of the staff directing more people into the area. Really disappointed in what should have been a great day out.,So much to see
"June 29, 2015",The museum seemed huge to me.  Almost endless rooms of interesting collections.  What amazed me though was the beauty of the building itself.  That even if the museum was emptied of all their artifacts it would still be worth visiting for the detailed architecture.,Good but tired 
"August 10, 2014","Firstly get there early. We arrived at 0930 at one of the side entrances, and was second in the queue. Secondly if you want to see the dinosaurs go there first. Then meant us walking past loads but worth it. Later in the day massive wait. Then start making your way around the rest. Some exhibits a little tired, still there after 20 years.With little ones three hours will do it. Cafés available but quite pricey. ",Extremely buggy unfriendly
"August 6, 2014","Don't bother visiting if your child is in a buggy. The whole place is buggy-unfriendly and you'll spend a v-e-r-y l-o-n-g t-i-m-e waiting for lifts. I gave up in the end - before we'd got a sniff of a dinosaur. That said, it's free, so it's churlish of me to complain.",Great family day out for free!
"August 3, 2014","we arrived at the museum at 9:30 and there was a queue but we didn't mind just watch as people like to push in, we got into the museum and went straight to the dinosaur section (do this first as it gets very busy and you will queue for ages) the boys loved this part and there is a moving trex. we looked around the whole museum which was good there is a lot of walking but you don't really notice till afterwards.The inside picnic area was all good was cool and plenty of tables and seats for all.The only thing I would say is that there is really any entrance and exits so everybody squeezes through small doors and can get cramped also would like hand gels around as theres a lot of things to touch, it is also very hot in some parts.we left around 13:30 and to our surprise people were still waiting to get in.all in all was a good day out and we will be visiting again",Fab fab fab!
"August 2, 2014",My 13 year old loved it and considering his interest in life is his xbox that is a big plus! Sadly didn't get to see it all as it got too hot and stuffy in there. We will go back though in cooler weather,Great museum for free
"July 26, 2014","Arrived around 11am today, from the Exhibition Road entrance, there was no queue so walked straight in :)  Went as a family with 16mth old and 8yr old, 8 year old really enjoyed it, reading about everything in a way which was easy to understand. Was busy to go around with a pushchair but found everything we wanted to see accessible. Enjoyed the earthquakes and vulcanoes exhibition and seeing the blue whale. We prebooked our dinosaur gallery tickets and glad we did, meant we could go to the front of the queue. Only spent about 2 and a half hours there overall as it felt too hot walking around, would love to go back to spend more time looking around on a cooler day.",Very warm but worth the visit
"July 26, 2014",It was an extremely hot day when we visited and some of the smaller exhibit halls in the red zone were unbearable.  Blue and green zones where much better though although we couldn't stay as long as we wanted due to the heat.  Worth a revisit on a cooler day.,Great free venue
"July 8, 2014","Really enjoyed learning about earthquakes!  the bat event was amazing and I got to talk to a lovely long eared bat!  the highlight for me had to be the butterfly exhibition, only £5 entry but just peaceful and magical, only a small area but I lost an hour in there, I would highly recommend it.",Too busy and have seen better
"July 8, 2014","My wife and I thought that it would be a great experience to go to the Natural History Museum,  however,  what we saw the most of was people's backs school groups pushing through and some very inconsiderate people shoving their way through the long queues. Of the very few displays, that we did get to spend more time at they were often broken or in a state of much needed repair. The building itself is fantastic however for the effort required to navigate the crowds, there are much better museums around the world to visit. ","Educational, Fun & Inspiring"
"July 7, 2014","I love the Natural History Museum and try to make sure I visit every time I go to London.  The quality of what is on display is second to none.  The Darwin Centre was extremely inspiring, especially to be able to see scientists at work (try to go in the week as they don't work weekends).  Everything was reasonably priced (especially considering you are in London) and the staff were all wonderful.  Old or young, there is something for everyone - there's a good mix of things to see and do.  The building itself is beautiful, and it is spotlessly clean inside.  There's everything from Dinosaurs to plants and art.",Such an interesting place.
"July 3, 2014","A wonderful day at the Museum. The section of the Kobe Earthquake was quite impressive.Dinosaurs and Mammals are a must see. Possibility of interaction together with an educational approach capture the attention of the whole family. Be warned, though, if you are truly interested in the exhibitions, one day might not be enough. If you are visiting but do not have more than two or three days to devote to the Museum, it might be wise to choose the areas that interest you the most, and leave the others for another future visit. You can get an overall look of rooms and exhibitions online, print a few maps and then decide on what you prefer.Tip: don't miss the T-Rex!!",I would rate it as the best of all london museums.
"January 1, 2015","I would rate this museum as the best of all London Museums. The dinosaurs are unmissable and blue zone contains lots of information about mammal's but the star for me is the red zone. In short, there is plenty for everyone to enjoy.",Waste of time
"December 13, 2014",Visited here as a child and then about 8 years ago To sum it up AWFUL half the exhibits have disappeared for a museum to be part of the new night at the museum film would have been nice to have an exhibition about that Couldn't get in half the dinosaur display due to queues staff hanging around bored senseless. And the security search is just ridiculous Hardly surprising it's free to get in can't see anyone paying,Fun afternoon with the dino's
"December 6, 2014","One thing I love about London Museums is that they are free.  This fact makes it easy to visit and  do one exhibit at a time.  As this is all my back can handle, my son and I did the Dinosaur exhibit the other day.  Educational and fun with real and fake ""dino's"".  We had a great time looking at the fossils and reading about the ancient animals.  The building is beautiful, very ""British"" with lots of history of its own.  In the winter they have an outdoor ice skating rink.  A fun day out for any age.",Dinosaurs!
"November 16, 2014","Tube station conveniently located around the corner from a tube station (South Kensington) the museum is not only very interesting, it is completely free! The dinosaur bones are a joy to behold & i feel privileged to have seen them a couple of times now. For anyone interested in history or dinosaurs you can't get much better",Fantastic Museum! Awesome exhibitons and FREE!
"November 14, 2014","I love the Natural History Museum! It is a fantastic place that is made even better by the fact that it is free! The dinosaur exhibit is great fun for younger and older kids as well as informative.  The mammals section is also really cool with a huge stock of specimens and the sheer size of the blue whale is awesome in itself.  The human body section is also very well done but my favourite exhibit is the geology wing. They have an enormous wing full of all of these different minerals with the larger more spectacular specimens in larger cases on the sides. Then, at the end of the wing, there is the vault, which is full of massive gemstones and jewels with shadowy history. Finally on the top floor is the section of an enormous tree with major events in history noted on the rings. There are many photo opportunities available throughout the museum but the tree and the main hall are the most spectacular. There is a cafe on the ground floor, which is a little expensive if you're travelling on a budget so if you want to save money bring your own food. It is very well signed and there are employees everywhere so you don't need to buy a map but it is a cool souvenir. Also they currently have an ice rink set up outside but I don't know much about prices.",Great Museum to visit.
"November 12, 2014",My wife an I visited this Museum and we wished that we had brought our kids on this trip.  Children will love this museum.,Tired
"November 6, 2014",We headed for this place having never visited before and found it very disappointing. It seemed very drab and displays were poorly presented. The majority were aimed at the very young but even those seemed poorly done. An animated scorpion looked dusty and grubby in need of a wash. The splendid entrance hall with the dinosaur skeleton was all there was to be pleased with and one area was off limits to us as the lift was out of order and having mobility problems we could go no further. It's sad that such a famous building is so badly displayed and tended. It may be free entry but this is no excuse to let a fine institution such as this become so tired. We will not return and I would advise going to the British museum or the National gallery rather than waste your time with this.,Truly excellent.
"November 5, 2014",For kicks it's free which is  the best price for a museum.  Queues can get large though for a reason. Lots of fascinating exhibits and well worth a few hours of your time. ,The best museum in London in my opinion!
"November 4, 2014","The best museum, plus free, plus it is interesting to pretty much everyone who comes to visit London. The British history, for instance, might not interest quite a lot of people, natural history is interesting to almost everybody. We always take everyone who visits us in London to this museum, at least to the Dinosaurs gallery.",Dinosaurs
"November 1, 2014",I loved it and I especially loved the dinosaurs.There was a lot of interesting things to see.I am only     six years old.,An amazing time!
"September 19, 2013","I learnt so much from that museum, did you know that more than 126 million natural science specimens and cultural artifacts are contained within the museum’s meticulously documented collections! I got to a whales stomach! Make sure you see the earthquake room, it was so amazing. I live in Singapore so I have never even felt a tremor of an earthquake so when I got to feel what it was like, I was amazed. The architecture of that place is amazing and there is so much to learn. It is a fun place for kids and adults and for everybody. I had an amazing time. Harry Winston donated the Hope Diamond to the Smithsonian in 1958 which is a whopping 45.52 carats and is also the museums greatest attractions. You should go there early in the morning so that you can see everything. Enjoy!",You're never too old to learn
"September 2, 2013","On a recent visit to London we travelled by tube to South Kensington with our three young granddaughters and their parents to visit the Natural History Museum. It was a marvellous day and we all learned something new. The Dinosaur exhibit is the standout attraction and it's great, but it's crowded, slow moving and quite dark. The T-Rex is actually so realistic that even I was frightened of it, so little children need to be prepared and be holding on to someone! Other reviewers have commented that the Museum is ""dumbed-down"" and that might be so in some areas, but it has to cater for little children as well as scientists and paleontologists and I'm really glad that our very little girls were able to see life-like animals and ask lots of questions which we could answer because there were great amounts of information for the viewers. We all really enjoyed a wonderful Presentation on Frogs and Tadpoles and the children felt really welcome at that and did not get bored. We had morning tea and lunch at the Museum and there was a good choice of food and drinks but it was not cheap. Next time we go, I'll take a packed lunch for us all! And there will certainly be a next time.",Great idea to do with kids on a rainy day!
"August 27, 2013","Ideal for little (and not so little!) dinosaur lovers, but perhaps a little too busy as everybody had the same idea of something to do on a rainy day or so it seemed...Overall a great (and free!) day out.",Do not visit in school holidays
"August 21, 2013","Dreadful queue, no advice on website to bring sunscreen or hat, stuck in middaysun for an hour. Inside, more queues for new exhibits as need to pay. Unable to book advance tickets as not available. Don't bother just turning up.  Boiling hot inside, cafe packed, hot and too busy. Horrible experience. Left after an hour or so.",Not worth the wait
"August 14, 2013","Waited 1 hour to get in. There was nothing much to see. Will not be going again, which is a shame as the building is beautiful.",Great free day out
"August 5, 2013","We got here early, just as they were opening so there was a bit of a queue to get in.  To help us get around as we had never been we did purchase a guide at the entrance, but even though the guide seems a bit pricey its a lot cheaper than your average attraction entrance fee in London!For a free museum you don't expect TOO much, but in fact you get that and a whole lot more!  I think one of the most famous collections for this museum are the dinosaurs, and I must say that to date it is the best dinosaur exhibit I have ever seen...  it is great for adults, but I bet kids would love this part!I came mainly to see their collection of stuffed animals however as I had heard that this is one of the best collection of such specimens in the world.  While I agree that it is by far the most extensive and broad collection I have seen it lacked a few species which i have seen in other museums and even in the museums of some zoos (there is a collection of some really curious animals in Artis Zoo in Amsterdam, and some very rare / extinct species in the Natural History museum in munster, Germany - both of which included animals I would have liked to see in London).  However this was a very impressive collection, especially the larger animals and bird displays!  In terms of quality I have seen better mounted animals and these were on par even with collections I have seen in Borneo where they need to contend with much bigger humidity problems etc...  But this is due to the age of the majority of this collection.  When looking at antique mounts there are some very old ones here, although in many cases it does show.One thing which we almost didn't bother looking at because I have no usual interest in Geology is the vault room upstairs.  I think many people must think this, coupled with the stairs, as the room was very quiet.  However there are some very impressive items in here and I would recommend taking a look if you come to this museum!This is a great collection and certainly worth seeing if you have the time to spare in London, however it is in an area which has a number of places to eat around it and if there is one thing I would recommend is to eat before or after entering as it is very expensive in there...  But this is to be expected.",It's free! What more do you want?
"August 5, 2013","Yes there is a queue,I waited 10 minutes but it was a Sunday morning and a 10 minute wait to see a famous museum for free is ok by me.So I decided to go on a Sunday and it was very very busy! My 2 boys enjoyed themselves and as usual we wizzed round.Lots of stuff for the kids to do and see. One thing I will say is take your own food as it is quite expensive in there.",A must see even while battling the crowds!
"July 23, 2013","We visited the Natural HistoryMuseum with four kids under the ages of ten and a baby in a stroller on a hot and humid London day without any of the fans or AC really working in the museum and almost all tourists in London deciding to visit the museum on the same day... Or so it seemed!!! And yet... We LOVED it!!! Despite our slowness with all these kids in tow, we managed to visit the dinosaur exhibit, the mammals and sea life and the Darwin hall... The kids were in awe with the dinosaurs, the fun facts, the volunteers who patiently held up various skulls and listened to the kids' questions and the sheer size and authenticity of everything.  We have been through several natural history museums in our globe trotting but this is the mother of all museums!!! Truly one of a kind, cannot be beat. I would say it is the number one must see attraction in London... Just realizing the size of the life-like blue whale and taking a good look at a real life T-rex should be good enough reasons to visit. Indeed the dinosaur exhibit is incomparable to anything else we have seen and if you have a day like ours then even spending the time for this ONE exhibit is still worth it. Oh and it is free too!!! One more thing-- even though the butterfly center is not free (next door in the same yard as the museum) do not miss it!!! Plus for a family of five it was just 20 pounds and well worth the experience of seeing so many live and dazzling butterflies!",With young children a planned quick visit is best
"June 12, 2013","This was our first visit to the Natural History Museum and we probably should have planned better.  We were with our 2, 4 and 6 year old daughters and it was towards the end of our 2 day London visit so energy levels were not great.  Our initial idea of covering off all areas (albeit walking through some quicker than others) was a mistake as some exhibits had little chance of holding the interest of our young daughters.  Instead we should have just headed straight to the mammals area (which was excellent) and then the dinosaurs (good but a little overrated given the queues).  The Natural History Museum is an excellent free attraction but with young children it needs to be a short targeted visit, and any attempt to see it all should be forgotten.",A fantastic London museum!!
"June 1, 2013","This is one of the best museums I have ever visited. The Dinosaur collection is truly special & definitely my favourite bit. Try to get here early or on a weekday, because the queues can be long!",What an experience
"January 15, 2013",We had to queue to get in on a Saturday morning. Because it's free it's very popular with London familes as well as visitors. We were in within 10 minutes. Plenty of staff inside and outside to help visitors.I don't know what we expected as it was our first visit but we were there most of the day and returned the following day and still only got a superficial look. It's one of those places that you would return to time and time again. The exhibits from dinosaurs to volcanoes are simply world class.Weekends might be best avoided because of the crowds.Unless you're starving don't eat there. I could have got a 3 course meal outside in Cromwell Road for the price we paid for 2 buns and 2 cups of tea.,"free , so much to see and do"
"December 28, 2012","We love this as it's free and you can do so much. The only downside is the food is horrendously expensive, the downstairs cafe where the picnic area is was sold out of sandwiches by 1pm and the service was so slow, my husband ran out for a cigarette, went to the shop, on his return I still had not been served 20 minutes later. As most of the clientelle are parents with little kiddies the food prices are extortionate. I understand the rest is free so it's one way to recoup money but what was on offer was trying to be up market but was actually dire. So like most families we bring out own .The exhibits are all great, the signs could be better as people were wondering around lost, and staff were not exactly helpful. The discovery centre for kiddies downstairs was great fun , the kids enjoyed it too !! There was a 45 min queue for the dinos so we went to see the creepy crawlies instead. The staff need to wear name badges prominently and be more recognisable, our little one got dislodged from us in a crowd and she didn't know whom to ask for help.",NHM - Important Information for Muslim Tourists
"December 25, 2012","Another visit to the Natural History Museum and this time a couple more tips.  The queues at the main Cromwell Rd entrance was very large but the Entrance at the Exhibition Rd was empty so use that one.There is also a Faith Room right in front of the Exhibition Rd Entrance, you cant miss it, next to the First Aid Room so you can use that for your prayers, it is a small room but there are benches just outside so you can wait if it is busy.  We didn't check the ablution facilities as we had been to the Science Museum and used one of the many bathrooms there for Wudhu.Hope that helps.",Shadow of what it was
"December 12, 2012",Totally gutted by my experience of this once amazing museum. I'm quite sure the research etc done is as important as ever but what the public are now allowed to see is a fraction of what it was 20 years ago. Thought the whole point going to a museum was to see amazing things. This museum is only for under 12 year olds-  you'd be as well  reading an educational book than going here now.,Ice Rink open for the Winter
"November 4, 2012","We all know that the NHM is probably one of the wonders of the world and is a great trip ANY day of the year, but the ice rink outside is well worth booking up, I have given it only 4 stars at when you are a family of 5 it is a little expensive to be as inclusive as the museum has always been. One important tip, buy your tickets and print them off before you get there, it is run like clockwork, meaning everyone gets their time on the ice (just under an hour, which is more than enough) and the rink does't feel crowded and there are plenty of helpers around to keep things moving, clearing the fallen bodies etc.... give it a go and have fun, another tip, you get very warm skating.",Brilliant day out :-)
"October 9, 2012","WOW what a great day out, we visited on a Saturday which in hindsight is probably not the best day as it was VERY busy, we had to queue for about 20 minutes to get in (arrived 1030). What a building from the entrance hall to all the zones its awe-inspiring,  on entering you are confronted with a huge dinosaur exhibit, this grabs the kids attention straight away, The dinosaur zone is just amazing, its hard to believe these creatures used to roam the earth, again the queues were annoying to get round the zone but still does not take away from the experience.Another must see is the blue whale, my family and i just stared at the display for ages, the size of it is incredible. Yes i did notice lots of dust on top of these exhibits but SO what!! This is a free experience people stop winging at silly things, the staff at the museum are doing a great job in keeping hundreds of thousands of visitors every year entertained, well done to them all.We were at the museum for 3 hours and only got through half the zones, so put a whole day aside to really see everything.The onsite restaurant is reasonably priced for London. The toilets are clean and tidy.The museum is free to enter, the guide book is only £5 and i highly recommend buying both the adult and childrens ones as they are packed full of information and facts about the different exhibits.Reading through other reviews it makes me laugh that some people moan about the number of children around the museum!!! How on earth do these people expect kids to learn?? My kids soaked up all the information they learnt like a sponge and i do not expect them to act like they are living in Victorian times, if you dont like children then visit somewhere else!! While i was looking at exhibits plenty of ADULTS pushed in front of me, but i just let it go like everyone else should.This is a fantastic place to visit, i cant wait to return. I highly recommend all ages to visit :-)",Amazing museum for adults and children alike
"September 18, 2012","This museum is my absolute favourite destination and a place I recommend to all visitors to London. Beautiful dinosaur fossils, semi precious minerals and animal specimens frozen in time are abundant. As a child we'd visit this museum at least once a year as a school trip, yet there is plenty at this museum for adults. As a child I never noticed the beautiful stone walls, covered in beautiful carved animals. The Darwin Center is a relatively recent addition and contains Darwin's original research tomes. Windows into the core of the building allow visitors to observe scientists at work. One can't help but be inspired by the Natural History Museum. It is an absolutely brilliant and magical place.",free & very interactive
"September 16, 2012","This museum is free (as many others) and very interactive. It's very nice, you could visit with children and spend all day. Don't forget to visit the (free) science museum next door.",Good. Masses to see.
"September 10, 2012",Liked: everything we saw.Would take days to see it all.To many of the interactive things were broken & some were a bit dated.  Needs the same revamp the Science Museum seems to have had.,A dreadful experience
"August 29, 2012","We were so dissapointed with our experience at the Natural History Museum. I really hope that such a negative experience can be put down to us visiting on a Bank Holiday Monday! My partner and I arrived in London with our daughter early afternoon. We thought the Natural History Museum would be a great experience to fill the rest of our afternoon. How wrong were we! The queue  to get in was horrific - it took 45 minutes. Once eventually in the buliding we had to view the vast majority of exibits in what  can only describe as a claustrophobic queue, due to the sheer volume of people, and the bizarre layout of the buliding. Taking a decent photo was impossible - too many people who seemed to lack manners and consideration to others! On a positive note it is a beautiful building. Can see why it's free to get in though!!",A must visit museum
"August 13, 2012","Whenever I visit London, my kids insist that we visit the Natural History Museum. Obviously the dinosaurs are a big attraction 9you can book free tickets so you don't have to queue but I needn't have bothered as the Olympics meant a half-empty museum (relatively) and no queue at all. The animated dinosaurs are really good. The museum has good interactive displays, those in the human body area are good fun, visitors with kids should try to visit the basement's easily missed kids' hands-on area where children can handle fossils and play with a wide range of exhibits rather than just look at them. The huge mammals hall is well worth a look too. The museum will take all day to explore and will tire you out so plan what you want to see if you have less time.During non-Olympic visits I have found the side entrance has smaller queues, we didn't have to queue at all. In the past this museum has been very busy so go early if you dislike crowds.",Brilliant for young kids
"August 11, 2012","We travelled to London for the Olympic games and were there for a couple of days. On our first day in London we used Tesco Vouchers from the exchange service to take our 4 & 2year old daughters on a bus tour around London. The Original Tour Company accept vouchers and have 3different routes. One of these is called the museum route and takes you right past the front door of the Natural History Museum. This was a great service and the kids loved sitting on top of the bus watching the world go by and waving at people. Once we got to the museum, we walked in and a tour guide called Mark, asked if we had visited before. When we said no, he pulled us aside and spent 10 minutes telling us what the best areas would be for our kids to get the most out of the museum. We were in the museum for 4 hours which absolutely flew in and we only got to see a small part of the museum. Obviously the dinosaur exhibit is a must, but one gem we found only because we spoke to Mark was the Investigate Centre on the ground Floor. This is an area where kids can touch, measure, draw, weigh, and become involved loads of different things. My eldest daughter spent an hour going round the exhibit, selecting items and drawing, measuring and weighing them, and looking at them under the microscopes. She absolutely loved it, and would easily have spent more time in there. Only negative to the whole day is that food is expensive, but the museum itself is free and you could spend days in it looking at the exhibits. After leaving the museum we again hopped on the bus tour, and then changed routes to the main route and let the kids see the main sights of London. All in all it was a great day, and I would not hesitate to take our kids here again.","Amazing Building, Great Exhibits"
"July 12, 2012",We toured the National History Museum with our 4 and 7 year old boys.  They loved the kid friendly exhibits and the dinosaur fossils.  We (Mom and Dad) loved the architecture of this amazing building.  ,I cannot believe that a museum like this is free
"July 9, 2012","Do not leave London without visiting this museum. Take advantage of the low price... $0.00Excellent day out for the whole family, enjoyed the dinosaurs section the most.","Great Museum, Terrible Message"
"July 4, 2012","The Natural History Museum has an absolutely amazing collection; there is no doubt about it. And it offers a fantastic day out. But I am afraid that I cannot stand the place.What was a museum founded by Sir Richard Owen to display the glory of nature has become a temple to Darwinism. Sir Richard's statue was in fact taken from the front and put to the back, while Darwin's was put in its place (they were actually sworn enemies). Only one explanation is ever offered for the history of the universe and living things, and that is the evolution theory/naturalism.Creationism is openly mocked, while the huge gaps in the theory of evolution and our knowledge of natural history is glossed over repeatedly. I studied the Laetoli tracks at the museum and it is crystal clear they are the feet of an anatomically modern human, yet the museum insists they belonged to Australopithecus Afarensis, which is a complete impossibility. Then again, if you have shot yourself in the foot (pun intended) by saying they are 3.5 million years old what are you going to do? If you are looking for indoctrination then this is the place - if you are looking for empirical science you will be sadly disappointed.",Great Museum but Avoid School Holidays (and Wet Days)!
"June 18, 2012","Spent half a day there last week but must admit a lot of that was due to the fatal mistake of going during half term on a very wet day. It is a wonderful museum but it was very overcrowded when we visited and the Dinosaur section in particular got very claustrophobic with the crowds on the walkways. Accessabiliy was also an issue as a number of lifts were not working which caused problems for people like myself who are disabled and also caused problems for parents with large buggies having to try to go back through the crowded ""one way system"" to get the buggies back to ground level. A lesson could be learned here from the wonderful Castle Museum in York - Have a buggy park and rent carriers for the youngsters.  The museum is too crowded for these large buggies.The Earth Zone is very interesting.Maps can be purchased for £1 and they are well laid out and easy to follow. The Dinosaur section would have been a lot more enjoyable without the crowds.It is a very good and interesting museum but our visit was spoiled by the overcrowding and the ""out of order"" lifts.We had planned on going to the science museum afterwards but we reckoned that would be even more crowded so gave it a miss on this visit.",Excellent museum for people of all ages!
"May 14, 2012","Visited this musem together with my 76 years old father, my brother (35) an my son (6) and we all had a lovely day. There was quite a queue when we arrived at 11. AM but we tookk turns to stand in the line and the others could walk around in the park or visit the small shop outside. Perhaps a shorter queu if you arrive at 10 when they opened. There are soooo much to look at in this museum but we started with the dinousaur exhibition, then we looked at spiders, snakes and insects for like an hour and finally the vault with beautiful rocks, diamonds, and glittering things. We left the museum at appr 4.30 PM and had then also had lunch and a coffe break in the museum. It was a perfect day and we all could find interesting things to look at. The building it self is worth a visit. Like a castle or an ancient church. An its free!! :D",Educational even for adults
"May 12, 2012","I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here.  The dinosaur exhibition was really educational and I have learnt much.  For how impressive the exhibits are, I am very grateful that it was free.",Fantastic
"May 7, 2012","I take my childen, age 8 &6, to the museum every few months.Its a stunning building & an amazing place.You could spend the entire weekend wondering around, there is SO much to see and do.My son held a held a milk snake during a live animal show on our last visit.We always take a picnic and eat it in the main hall.I really cound't recommend this place enough :)",Very interesting
"April 10, 2012","The museum is enormous and has a lot to see. I found it very interesting, it takes you back to the begining of the world until now. You can see the era of the dinosaurs, our era, the animals that live in our planet, etc.I recomend it!",Average
"April 4, 2014","I went today with my 7 and 4 year old....not in the school holidays.  The first queue in Cromwell Road entrance was very very long.  There were 2 bored staff members just standing there. I asked if there was another entrance - there is.  The Exhibition Road entrance has NO queues but of course we had to walk all the way around the building to get there...there should be staff outside directing people.In fact, the staff issues were HUGE.  Not enough of them, not enough sign posts to tell you where anything was, so lots of walking around in circles.  The dinosaur walkway is an absolute nightmare, and this is out of school holidays.  There should be staff on there helping people as the walk round it was long and very slow.  My children were shoved everywhere, and my 4 year old was hit so hard on the side of her face her eardrum nearly burst.  Packed with impatient tourists who don't seem to have the ability to queue or be polite and just push through everyone.There is a great picnic area in the basement, but many tables are reserved for school parties so get there at 11.30am or before.All the staff without fail were miserable and very unpleasant to talk to.  Some of them were downright rude.  Many of the lifts were broken, so if you have a buggy or a wheelchair you are a bit stuffed.The dinosaur section is very packed and very very very hot, you have been warned!",Very boring
"March 11, 2014","Very boring, totally not interesting. Maybe it's nice for kids, not for adults. we went here with only adults. ",Be surgical and your day will be great!
"March 9, 2014","Against my better judgement, we visited the museum during the school holidays.  I employed a skill I gained whilst visiting the British Museum.The museum can be overwhelmingly busy, it is imperitive that you arrive at opening time.  We got there 20 minutes before opening and there was a queue to enter.  You must head straight for the Dinosaur display.  Even though we got there at opening time, there was still a congested walk around the display.  On leaving the dinosaur display, the queue for new visitors to see the dinosaurs was well over an hour.Once you've seen the dinosaurs, the choice is yours.  We prefer to pick the 5 things we would most like to see, and head towards them, stopping on the way to look at displays. The museum is like the worlds best zoo, with the exception that everything is dead and stuffed.  Every type of creature to have walked,crawled,slithered or flew is available to be seen, from the Dodo, to the Blue Whale.  The amount of creatures is truly overwhelming, which is why I would advise you to pick what you really want to see.Full facilities are available, toilets etc, and there is a cloak room.Meals and snacks are hideously expensive,  if bringing a family, I would advise bringing snacks etc.The museum is adjacent to the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert so if the Natural History Museum gets too much, you can go to one of these.  I would recommend the V and A.",All I can say is wow!
"February 17, 2014","What an amazing museum and it's free! It's half term so we arrived early (just after 10am) and only had to wait 10/15 minutes to get in. The entrance hall certainly has the wow factor... I felt as though I'd walked onto a film set! We went straight through to the dinosaur section as I'd read that it gets very busy. The boys loved it in here, especially the moving dinosaurs and scary T-Rex! We only had a few hours spare so we had a quick walk round to see the Blue Whale, which was found close to where the boys' grandparents live. Another wow... It's huge! By the time we came out at midday, the queues to get in and to see the dinosaurs were VERY long so I'd definitely recommend getting there early. ",This place is great!
"February 9, 2014","The museum is free to enter and there are loads of really interesting things to see, consequently it gets busy, especially in the school holidays and at weekends.  I would have thought it is obvious, but if like us you can't avoid busy days, get there early.  The food is a little pricey (they have to make some money out of us) so if you don't like that, take your own.  That way you can avoid the cafe queues too.  And for anyone who reads this review then rates the museum as poor/ terrible, why don't you write to your MP asking for entrance charges to be reintroduced.  That way it will be quiet and you can keep all the common people/ families out.  THIS PLACE IS WONDERFUL - TRY AND APPRECIATE HOW LUCKY WE ARE!",a must for anyone bringing children to the city
"January 27, 2014","just wandering around the building is an experience...and its free, but its so child friendly...you could easily spend a whole day here...we ate at the restaurant was really good and good value too",Unbelievable queue.
"January 21, 2014","Attempted to visit this museum on a Saturday ( January 18th). The minute I stepped foot outside the train station, there was already one hell of a queue waiting to go in. For pete's sake, why? I have been to museums in New York and never have I encountered such things before. With a heavy heart, I cancelled my plan to visit this museum and went to other places of interest.",A family day out
"December 27, 2013","Booking on line to see the Dinosaurs is a must during school holidays, its free and can save you an hour or so queuing up. Another hidden offer is for young kids, for a minimal deposit kids get an explorers backpack and safari helmet. Lots of stuff inside the backpack to get the kids interacting with the displays a bit more. Will be back at some point in the near future!",Make sure to ask about the specimen tour
"December 18, 2013","I won't write any more about the general exhibitions at the museum. The highlight of my trip was the 8 person tour of some of the specimen that are not on show, unless you take the tour. All you have to do is ask about the free tour at the information desk. During the tour, we were shown specimen from Charles Darwin's famous expeditions and much, much more.",Can I give this six out of five please?
"October 2, 2013","I hadn't been to the Natural History Museum since I was a child, so my visit felt all-new. I was totally unprepared for the huge scale of the museum, the quality of the exhibits and the sheer brilliance of the place. As if all that wasn't enough, right at the end of the day I stumbled on the Cocoon. The audacity and vision of its designers absolutely delighted me.Entrance is free, though there are collection boxes where you can make a donation if you want (I certainly did!).As well as viewing the exhibits I also ate at the Benugo restaurant in the museum - I had a large salad plate, and it was both substantial and very tasty - and pretty reasonably priced for central London at £8.55 for the salad and a large latte.I spent the afternoon in the museum and I ran out of time. Next time I will allow a full day - there is so much to see.",fun every time
"April 5, 2012",each visit to london means a visit to natural history museum ....and they have the best chocolate pie....;-)),Top Museum and its free..!!
"March 17, 2012","Very informative and amusing. a must for families... may have to wait in the line for a little while though. If you are visiting with family, best thing is to start early.",you have to go
"February 20, 2012",ive always liked natural history so i guess this is the place for me .it has constantly evolved over the years ive been going .with so much to see and learn i dont think i could ever tire of this place .last time i went i made a trip to see the wildlife photographer of the year which is always impressive .you should go :))),"Poorly Organised, Old, Crowded."
"January 30, 2012","Went back after about a decade and what a mistake. Firstly had to queue up outside. Not because on the number of people but because they only let you through to the security check in batches. This I would not have minded if there was actually some sort of security check, but there wasn't! I went to present my backpack only to be ushered straight through as was everyone else. Why make everyone queue up for a nonexistent security check?Once inside we had to dodge all the idiots who insist on walking around with empty baby buggies, or buggies that just held all their coats. I got so fed up with all these empty buggies getting in the way or banging into my ankles I started counting. Only one out of every seven buggies had a child in it. I would not have minded if there was a baby in it, but why get in everyone way for no reason? This again is partly the fault of the museum, why on earth won’t you sort out a buggy park? Visitor can park their buggies and collect them when the child starts to get tired. It’s not rocket science.(That’s next door in the science museum!)Then there are the even bigger idiots who allow their children to go round the museum on bloody scooters! These idiots are both the lazy parents who obviously have no common sense and allow their kids to scoot round crashing into everyone, and the museum for allowing them in with scooters in the first place!The next issue is if you want to eat or, as in my case, just want a cup of coffee. The queue for food and drink at either the restaurant or cafe was more than twenty minutes! Why not install coffee machines and sell drinks in the shops as well? Place a few vending machines around as well you’ll probably make some money. Whilst speaking about making money, the big dinosaur in the main hall you can pay to either light it up, or to make it roar. For the extortionate amount of £10! Whilst I was there I never heard it roar at all. Here’s a tip museum. Make it a pound and everyone will be doing it. You’ll make a fortune!The biggest disappointment is how little anything has changed over the years. Technology has come on leaps and bound so surely they can provide more interactive and entertaining stuff? Maybe some will like it that way, maybe it’s just because a couple of clicks on the internet and you can see videos of real animals that are alive and in their natural habitat, rather than inanimate models and dead and stuffed animals. Yes some of the dinosaurs move a bit but not much when you consider we are in the twenty first century. Can’t they show some video of the animal next to the model or the stuffed one so we can see how it moves, hunts and why certain features have evolved.I used to love the museum, I still want to. Get someone in to run it with some new ideas.",Natures Gems
"January 18, 2012","From Massive Dinosaurs to miniscule brilliant insects.  From beautiful rocks and gems, to amazing plants.  Pretty much all of life is here - preserved in some form or another.  Lots of Homo Sapiens too!!  As well as the collections, the Building is a stunning work of High Victoriana in Teracotta.  This is one Museum that you really NEED to look all around!",interesting and enjoyable
"January 4, 2012","really enjoyed this visit. Dinosaurs are fantastic.Went in xmas holidays so was very busy free to get in , so excellent value",Probably the best thing in London
"December 15, 2011","Little in London is of true world-class standard nowadays, but this is one of them. The museum is probably amongst the four best museums on Earth for Paleontology, and there are some seminal specimens in the collection. If possible, if one is a true naturalist, arrange a trip to see some of the archived treasures. They makes the full extent of the museum apparent. Architecturally, it is in probably my favourite Victorian building, beautiful both within and without. It is usually overcrowded and is not especially clean, but these are ubiquitous problems in the capital, and if ignored this museum will delight. Especially good for the family.  ",All you could want from a day out in London
"November 28, 2011","Brilliant day out with the kids learned so many things and didn't have enough time to see every attraction whilst in the museum as there is so much in there..Dinosaurs everywhere in the main hall, with different exhibitions of all sorts of things branching off into different directions..You need a good day or two to be able to take in everything at the Natural history museum..We took our own flasks and packed lunches, but food was available to buy!If the kids are sponges for knowledge then this place is the bees knees for your young Einsteins!",Great for kids - but dubious dinosaur exhibition!
"August 16, 2011","Taking our nephews (7 and 9) to London for their first visit wouldn't have been complete without a visit to the Natural History Museum, and on the whole they enjoyed it very much.However, as others have pointed out, the Age of the Dinosaur exhibition is a bit of a waste of money.  It cost £28 for a family ticket and took 5 minutes to see.  And be warned - you can't take pictures in here (although I didn't notice a sign and it seems to be OK in the rest of the museum).  I was taking a quick shot of the kids with my mobile and a member of staff shouted at me....I guess they're mostly used to dealing with children!  My mistake, but even so a little courtesy wouldn't go amiss.The one benefit of the exhibition ticket was that it enabled us to get fast track access to the museum which was a big plus given the length of the queue.I suppose it was inevitable that on a Saturday in school summer holidays the place was going to be overflowing with children, and this made it extremely hot, noisy and uncomfortable for adults.  Getting a seat for the highly overpriced refreshments was a struggle, so perhaps a cheaper alternative would be to bring your own food and drink. We all enjoyed a visit to the main gift shop and found some reasonably priced souvenirs and gifts. Negative points aside, the museum is a very informative and interesting place to visit.  If you don't have children with you, I'd recommend picking a weekday in school term time.","Amazing, Amazing Amazing...did I say amazing?"
"July 4, 2011","I've been to London more times than I can count, but whenever I go, there is always something to visit that I never did before. On my last trip to London I decided to drop in at the Natural History Museum. It is one of three large museums in South Kensington, but by far for me, the best! Getting to the museum is quite easy as the closest London Underground station is South Kensington. From there, you can miss the museum when you arrive on the street level. Inside the museum is massive and reminded me of walking through the Louvre in Paris. I spent most of my time in the Blue Zone which contained exhibits such as mammals, dinosaurs and reptiles. I particularly liked the Charles Darwin exibit and there is even a statue of him in the museum as well. This attraction is excellent for a family day out and is completely free to enter. I highly recommend it!","Fascinating, mesmerising, absorbing"
"January 22, 2020","Contrary to the  song ""A Foggy day in London town,"" the British museum has NOT lost its charm. You can be a time traveller in other worlds and all in one place for free unless you are going to special exhibition. Immerse yourself in the Egyptian room on the ground floor. Admire the cat there and look eyeball to eyeball at the face on the black coffin.  And check out the stupendous black and red Greek vases elsewhere, which in their time were less valued than their contents (oil!).  Accompanying captions are informative. There's usually quite a lot to read, especially in the special exhibitions (eg. Troy and Inspired by the East- Islamic art's influence on Western art), which can be difficult when it's crowded. I use the large print catalogues so I don't have to peer down at the labels.  The shops are tempting, a bit pricey but a great place for unusual presents. Cloakroom is at least £2.50. NO wheeled cases allowed. Often a long queue for security checks at the front entrance, moves quite quickly. Members skip the line. This time I went in via back entrance in Montague Place. There is still a bag check but there was no line. Museum crowded when I visited between Xmas and New Year, but much quieter when I went 10 days later to see a special exhibition. Check for access. I noticed an outside lift at the front of the museum by the colonnade. The cafe in the Great Court is good, but a bit pricey and there isn't enough seating (eat out?). Don't miss this wonderful museum. ",Overwhelming!
"January 12, 2020",The British Museum is amazing. I went on a Friday night when they were open late. There were lots of people there but it didn’t feel crowded. I was able to move through the rooms that I wanted to see without any delay. So much history in such a beautiful building. I highly recommend if you’re interested in this museum to maybe go over a couple days and spend a few hours at a time. Because it can be overwhelming to try and see everything in one trip.,Cloak room restriction
"January 20, 2020","We came from out of town and had a small cabin suitcase with wheels with us which we planned to leave at the cloakroom. It was not allowed. No alternative given. Maybe itvqas our fault for taking it for granted, as we left it in other museums, with no problem. The rule is, no wheels, full stop. We already paid to see the Islamic art exhibition. Fortunately a small Italian restaurant opposite the museum agreed to take it for £5 charge. So, take note. Leave yr wheelie luggage at a left luggage in railway stations or at Yr hotel if you plan to go to the otherwise magnificent British museum.",Troy Exhibition
"February 6, 2020","We booked timed tickets for the Troy Exhibition ( we even managed 241 tickets) but  although the exhibition was very good it was very, very busy when we visited at 11am on a Monday in February.So busy that we found we had to wait in line for a considerable time to see some items.Children running about did not help.",BP's Troy exhibition - excellent
"February 18, 2020",We booked in advance and greatly enjoyed this exhibition. I'd done some reading up first so much of the history in the exhibition made more sense so I recommend doing a Wiki on the history of the city first. We spent a couple of hours there having arrived early and spent another hour wandering around some of the other great galleries. Decent cake in the cafe too.,Amazing museum
"February 29, 2020","There is so much to see here that you will need to return another day.  I saw three exhibits:  German Emergency Money 1914-1924, Disposable?, and the Troy:  Myth and Reality exhibits.  The Troy exhibit featured depictions of the myths about Troy, artifacts found at Troy, and objects inspired by Troy.  This museum is a definite must see in London.  (If you are over 60, visit on a Monday afternoon and pay half price for exhibits with an admission charge.  You can only purchase these tickets in person.)",You're probably not allowing yourself enough time
"March 14, 2020","The treasures available to view are simply incredible.  If you're not taking a guided tour I recommend finding one of the many websites (even the museum map) to point out the key exhibits.  Otherwise, you can really spend all day+ inside.  Plus this helps you plan your visit much more efficiently.My favorites were the Rosetta Stone and the Greek section.  But, there is much-much more!I also recommend getting there when it opens because it will get crowded - especially when the school groups start to show up.Along with Buckingham Palace & The Tower of London, this is a must see.",Always something interesting to see 
"March 1, 2020",There is always something interesting to see.  Would recommend concentrating on one or two areas   otherwise it could be overwhelming.  My particular favourite is the Parthenon Gallery with the Elgin Marbles.  Amazing. Have visited twice and found something different each time. I also enjoyed the French Impressionists prints from Manet to Cezanne an exhibition which is on until August  2020 ..and it's free. Bag searches are in operation but the queue moves quite quickly and the staff are very friendly. Probably best to find eating places outside or take in your own food. The cafes are not that good and service is very slow and disorganised. ,Not yet
"September 5, 2020","Ordinarily a great way to spend an afternoon, this wasn’t worth the pre- booked time and journey out there when only the ground floor galleries are open. Other London museums have reopened much more of their collections, and I would have waited longer before going had I known. The offerings in the cafe weren’t particularly inspiring- £3 for a tea is not good value! ",If museums are your thing... 
"March 4, 2020","Huge place, lots of options to explore. If you really want to enjoy and learn the history, I recommend having more than 2 hours available on your trip itinerary. I personally like visiting museums, this one became one of my favorites. Amazing pieces, art, photos, etc... ",Great museum!
"April 16, 2020","This museum was the largest I have ever been to, I got lost a couple times. ;pThere were also a lot of exhibits to check out! It was great to check out all the exhibits and learn a bit about London's history. There is a fee for audio guides and for the featured exhibit.  When I went to this museum, it very crowded and there is also no map provided but the place does have free wifi, so perhaps it was provided online?Otherwise, I had a good time.",A must to see
"January 25, 2020",My travel guide said the side entrance would be shorter but it was closed so had no choice but to use the front. Arrived just after 10am when it opened on a Wednesday. Very short queue to get in through security which is outside the museum. As I had no bag was waved through which helped. There were a number of school parties and coaches arriving so glad I came early.The museum is so large and varied that it is not possible to see everything in one visit.I wanted to see The Rosetta Stone which unfortunately was one of the first exhibits and although there was no real queue to get in the museum there were a large number of people in front of the exhibit taking photos and in the end I gave up trying to get to the front. Would have been better if it had been further in the museum so crowds would have spread out. My next exhibit I wanted to see was The Elgin Marbles which were in a room at the back of the ground floor and when I got there the room was nearly empty...making my point about the siting of the previous exhibit.I also wanted to see exhibits on the first floor which again didn’t have big crowds as it was still early. Had a coffee downstairs before I left.Next time I am in London I will visit again to see other things. The museum is free although donations are appreciated ,Weekend museum visit
"March 8, 2022","On visiting the website prior to visiting, it suggested we needed to book tickets and we did, however on arriving the tickets were not checked at all, so I am not sure if this is still necessary. Tickets to special exhibitions are definitely needed, but I felt pricey. Lots to see in the museum and something for everyone. There were some collections that didn’t interest me, but others that I thought were very interesting. I especially like the watches and clocks. There is a lovely Japanese restaurant nearby, called Cocoro and I would recommend eating here if visiting the museum as it is only a few minutes walk away.",Totally worth a visit. 
"September 16, 2020","My wife and I had been looking at. Museums to visit during our three days in London.  I booked online which was easy and straight forward, it is free but we did make a donation. Don't worry because there are plenty of places to make donations at the museum. We showed up on time flashed our passes and jumped the queue, which I have to say was really great. The museum is amazing and the pieces of history there are simply breathtaking.  It was busy there and everyone was wearing a mask,  some people would adhere to social distancing and others would not. There is a little cafe area half way through to purchase hot drinks and a little bite to eat. It is aroubd £3.00 for a cup of tea and more for a coffee.. Baguettes were priced £5 and over. Allow yourself a minimum of two hours to walk around.",Incredible exhibits 
"January 6, 2020",I would highly recommend a visit to The British Museum it has an extensive range of exhibits from all around the world. Descriptions and information are clear and informative. Picking up map is a must so that you don’t miss out on anything! There is more than history too there are art exhibits and extra installations which change periodically. You may need a full day or more! ,Very long wait at the entrance
"January 3, 2020","It took me twenty minutes to get into the British Museum yesterday.  There was a long queue and only one security guard on my side checking bags, who didn't even grunt when I handed him my rucksack.  I wondered why there was a woman beside him doing nothing, and another four at the top, also not checking bags.  It was only when I was asked to go to counter 2 that they asked me for a donation.  Given that I'd spent 20 minutes in the cold, waiting to have my bag searched, by a woefully under-resourced, and rude, security guard, I didn't feel like contributing.  If they'd also been checking bags, my waiting time would have been substantially less.  It gives a very bad impression of what is one of the best museums in the world. I live in London and come often.  My friend was inside with my ticket for the Troy exhibition and I was always buy food and a drink when I visit.  I support the British Museum, and have never objected to doing so until yesterday. I think that you have to review your security procedures.",A MUST SEE!
"February 28, 2020",The British Museum is a gem of history.  Don't be daunted by the line to get into the museum.  I almost vaulted but I stayed the course.  Who know when I will be back in London? The line moved along quickly. The museum is free but there are many stations situated for you to donate £5.  Wear comfortable shoes there is a lot of standing and walking.  So much to see and do!,Give yourself plenty of time
"October 2, 2021","Its free but booking a time slot at busy times might give you quicker entry. It was quiet when I went and other than a bag check I was in within five minutes. The size of the collections is immense and you start by wondering where to start top to bottom right to left, then you enter each section and either walk around and on to the next or walk left to right, then do you go from the furthest time to the present. It's all choice and looking at each exhibit and taking a small part in will take a minimum of two hours. It's more of a collection of artefacts picked up from when Britain had an empire when collectors and archaeologists could dig or pick up and bring back almost anything they liked. You do wonder after a while ''How did they take so much from the poorer less developed areas of the World '' and could it be done today? The ''British'' part is interesting and the story can be seen in many regional British Museums. The Museum is dominated by the earliest cultures that our own western ones would have developed from such as  early Egyptian, Roman & Greek civilisations. I can't see a part of the planet that hasn't been covered. You cannot fail to learn something from a visit and if you wanted to go in-depth into an era then you will need plenty of hours planned and possibly day's to do it justice. If you're local to London then as it's free and Public transport frequent then you could go whenever. Its heavy on the feet if you intend seeing the lot and keeping kids interested might be a challenge, the Mummies might fascinate or scare them. it's warm inside due to the glass roof but it's cooler in some rooms that have large fans to stand by.Gift shop is too full of irrelevant items that can be bought anywhere and have nothing to do with the museum there's a few London gifts like Taxis and Bus models.I'd prefer more Museum specific based gifts .Cafe's looked and expensive £3 for tea, with not more choice than a Train Station Newsagent would sell, Crisps and pre-packed Sandwiches it wasn't busy but was short staffed the queues added price were slow enough to avoid.",Incredible
"April 10, 2020","You could spend a lifetime here and never fully appreciate all the treasures.  Plan on at least half a day (minimum) to see the highlights.  If you are traveling with children, you can check your coats/bags free of charge in the family cloakroom.  We also used the object-based tours available on their website - as a type of scavenger hunt through the museum.",Really impressive museum - and it is free
"November 20, 2021","A really impressive museum - well laid out, absolutely full of artefacts, everything is very well explained, and efficiently organised.  The museum is free, although booking is advised (just so they can smooth numbers throughout the day I think).  Well worth a visit if you are in London.",World Class Collection of Antiquities
"March 10, 2020","World class museum with an amazing collection of artifacts, artworks, and treasures from every corner of the world.  Apart from the collection, the building itself is beautiful, with the King’s Library being a highlight.One could easily spend an entire day here.  The displays are very informative, and many of the items on display are not available for view in other museums (even in other large cities).  In my mind there were serious questions about the methods in which some of the items were acquired, and the museum was quite crowded, but it was still worth the visit.",My last Visit Was 50 Years Ago
"April 13, 2020",Due to the World wide shut in my visit to this wonderful museum was by the internet and much different to my frequent trips as a boy to this wonderful time machine that took me around the World. Showing me great works of art and beauty and great civilizations that came and went over time. My expeditions with my best mate at the age of 8 began with a 2 or 3 hr walk with my school bag full of bread and butter sandwiches and a fizzy drink and a very early start due to the distance we had to walk from the east end of London .The vidio  was very good and i am planing on visiting 12 other great museums this week.,"Japan, Books and Death"
"August 8, 2021","Upon arriving in London, my friend and I were unsure what to do and where to go while we waited for our other friends to arrive. We decided to go to the British Museum because there were several exhibitions there which interested us. We arrived at the front entrance and were horrified at the sight of the queues. We then saw a sign directing us towards a back entrance, so we walked around the block to a much quieter one. We didn't have to queue at all - a quick scan of the bags and that was it, we were in! We visited the Japanese exhibition first which was really interesting, followed by a quick tour of the Egyptians, Africans and a room all about death. We then went to the shop which had lots on offer - we left with a couple of books between us. Overall, a good experience. Lots of different types of exhibitions to keep lots of different types of people entertained. I would argue this isn't really a museum for children as opposed to the Natural History Museum, and be aware you can't take wheeled suitcases.",A Londoner's favourite London attraction
"January 11, 2022","I think the British Museum is amazing, i've been here many times over the years yet I feel I still haven't seen it all. This place is huge and covers a great diversity of regions and points in history. I would recommend just focusing on the particular galleries you want to see as it's too big to do it all at once. The best bit about it is that it's free, which I think is very important as lower income people shouldn't be priced out of getting to experience all this cultural heritage. Also I must say it's great going now because there aren't as many tourists about! - I did find it could get overly crowded sometimes in pre-Covid times. So this is the ideal time to go.Looking forward to my next visit!",Excellent exhibits but gift shop employee tried to scam us :(
"August 17, 2023","Great exhibits and queues moved quickly, seating was sparse. The gift shop manager(?) (blonde-ish man in purple shirt) overcharged us for a small unframed painting 'print', charged us £9.99 instead of £4.99, and when we asked him about it, instead of fixing the mistake he gaslit us into thinking that we'd somehow picked out the only higher quality one in the entire shop. Every display with these prints showed £4.99. He tried to convince us that another costumer had put a more expensive one on the rack of cheaper ones. However he failed to show us a single display that had these prints for sale for £9.99. Today we checked the museum website and found that there are two different quality prints however the higher quality one wasn't £9.99. It is very clear that we were overcharged and he was too stubborn to admit that he was wrong, and opted to argue with a costumer and leave his till which had a very long queue. Truly a horrible person I hope never to have the displeasure of meeting again. Terrible end to an otherwise wonderful day.",History of the World at the British
"January 28, 2020","I got there for opening time and this turned out to be a good move to avoid the crowds, which didn't take long to appear.  I'd visited before but still couldn't resist heading to the Rosetta Stone and Elgin Marbles as priorities before wandering through this vast enclave of world history.  My museum staying power is usually limited to around 2 hours before I weary, but 2.5 hours whooshed by before I got my belly call and exited for lunch.  An absolute must when you are in London.",A long one-way walk through
"October 23, 2020","Having booked in advance, it was straightforward to  follow the arrows and see their selection of pieces from ancient times up to more recent.  You can leave the trail at intervals to have a cup of tea or go round the shop, then rejoin the path where you left off.  It's a good way to sample what the Museum has to offer.","Great musuem, a must!"
"January 23, 2020","Went there on a Sunday morning. We did not wait for a long time to get in.It is very easy to visit and, as we wanted to spend only a limited time we found the object trails defined by the museum. It is easy & great to follow, I do recommend.",Very good 90 minute tour with Mandy
"February 14, 2020","We did an amazing 90 minute highlights tour with Mandy, who is a truly excellent guide. She was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable and made the experience special. There is a wide range of exhibits in this museum and one could spend days roaming the museum halls.",Amazing visit to an inconic museum
"January 25, 2020","First opened to the public in 1759, the museum buildings have been built, expanded, and rebuilt several times over 250 years. The architecture of this amazing building never ceases to inspire.  Largely developed as a result of the expansion of the British Empire, the British Museum has a permanent collection of some eight million works.  Some of the top items include the Rosetta Stone, The Lewis Chessmen, Egyptian statues and much more.  Read our full review at testedtravel.com",Great day out
"September 12, 2021","The British Museum was really interesting and has a huge collection of historic pieces from all over the world. You can spend as little or as long as you want here depending on your individual interests.  Unfortunately the Greek section was closed to the public when we visited which was a shame but there was still plenty of other displays to look at. I would definitely recommend purchasing a map for the small charge of £2 as it will show you where each display can be found and also points out a few interesting items you do not want to miss.The museum is huge and easy to walk around, there are a lot of stairs but also a lift is provided. I would definitely recommend a visit for a family day out.","Fascinating place, watch out for crowds."
"January 6, 2020","Took my daughters here for a day out. Had to wait in line for around 30 minutes to get in, but it was a Saturday in the summer, so no surprise. Some of the exhibits were very crowded, especially the Egyptian area, but other areas were much quieter. Overall a great experience, but worth choosing your visit time wisely.",A great museum for history buffs.
"May 30, 2022","If you love all things history, then The British Museum is the place to go. Free entry, and open late on Friday evenings (part of the year),  even if you only have a short amount of time, it is worth heading in just to see The Rosetta Stone. NOTE: to use bag/coat check, it costs per weight so be mindful that isn't free. We also found it so hot inside (even though it was 20 degrees out). Sections were also closed off at 5 pm, with no explanation or warning, even though we were there late on Friday and the last entry is at 8 pm (apparently) ",Great museum for history and art lovers!
"August 3, 2022","Amazing ancient art. I highly recommend this museum for people who love art, history, and the intersection of both. The Greek Marbles were the highlight of my experience. The gift shop offers great merchandise at a very affordable price.",Extremely Rude Security!
"June 14, 2022","We had a fantastic time in the museum! The museum itself is brilliant and the staff inside are great....however...We booked a timed slot online to get into the museum, but we were unsure if that meant we had to queue in the normal entrance or if there was another entrance for pre-booked tickets. We went up to the security guy standing next to the entrance to ask him what to do and where to go. He laughed and replied ""I can't let you in here"". I explained that we weren't trying to get in this way, we just wanted to know if we go in through the main entrance or if there was a pre-booked entrance. He kept laughing at us and replying with ""there is no way I am letting you in here go round! Go round! Go around!"" he kept repeating, getting more aggressive and louder. As we then queued up and got to the entrance, he started shouting at us to fill up the space. He kept laughing and shaking his head and shouting at us even as we were filling up the space. We felt really uncomfortable with this man, and felt very embarrassed as we were made to feel that we had done something wrong.This was a real downer on an otherwise brilliant day in the museum.",The worlds history 
"January 4, 2020",As a child I was taken by my parents .I did not appreciate this special museum preferring the science museum.We got to the museum just before 10 am when they open which was wise for this very popular museum.A free entry is an exception in these times .Many civilisations are shown with artefacts that have survived in some cases thousands of years .This is educational and a pleasure to visit A day is not enough and we will visit again soon .,Disappointing
"January 28, 2020",This is probably my least favourite museum in London. I found it very difficult to navigate even with a floor plan. Unfortunately on the day of our visit the museum was full of school children many of whom were far too young to appreciate the exhibits. There was too many of them and they were very excitable. The school staff did very little to control them. In the end we left without seeing all we wanted to see. Perhaps school visits could be better arranged so that there is a limited number of children on any given day.,Make the effort to visit now
"November 2, 2020","We wanted to just see the Ancient Greek section, so we booked up a slot. We spent about 90 minutes and it was excellent. Although there were a lot of people it was not so full and you were able to see all the exhibits with time and space.To visit now is a great experience and helps to keep our cultural life vibrant.",Not enough time in one day
"February 15, 2022","A real museum, did not disappoint, thoroughly recommended. I would definitely suggest planning your visit carefully, you can easily spend an hour in a room, decide what you want to see in advance and form there work out which rooms you need to visit. We didn't and ended up missing or skipping some areas, definitely need more than one day. There is a restaurant on the 3rd floor that is worth a visit, helps break up the day, probably need to book during school holidays or if you are a group of 4 or more. They serve lunch and afternoon tea (traditional style) but no takeaway quick snacks etc.",Käthe Kollwitz on till January 12 in Room 90
"January 7, 2020","The British Museum is always wonderful but if you are reading this early January 2020 go to see the Käthe Kollvitz exhibition on in Room 90 now till January 12th. Its free. This room is a must whenever you visit, it's the Print Room.I could wax lyrical but there is no point, see for yourself the wonders the Museum holds. Go early in the day to have some space. Much of the Museum is free, the special exhibitions are always special but. can be pricey, check online before you go. You don't have to see the money spinners to get loads out of your visit. The information desk is good and the gallery assistants very helpful.",Troy exhibition very good
"February 10, 2020","I had a wonderful time at this museum. I was looking for 10th to 13th century armour to draw from for a project and they had bits and pieces, but actually the rest of the museum was really interesting too and I ended up going to the troy exhibition and having a much better time than if I was just looking at armour. it was all nicely set up, Clean and very informative. It is a beautiful building also. especially all the Greek parthenon and ancient byzantine lion hunt corridors and stuff is really special and atmospheric. not so much of the sterile, boring ways that things are set up often in museums, which I see the importance of obviously for the sake of consistency between exhibits, but its nice to have different considerations for different things that you are exhibiting. I'm not sure I've managed to say what I wanted to say with that, but moving on: it's not something I usually pay attention to, but a lot of care was taken in the curation, especially for lower levels. good job I had a nice time",You have to make this one of your stops in London
"June 16, 2021","This is an amazing Museum, so big and interesting, with a lot of area. The entry is free, but in today's circumstances you have to book a time slot on their website. It's pretty easy to do though, and I suggest you make a donation if you can. Trust me it's totally worth it. I would suggest you either start in the morning or go in there two days in a row, because there is so much to see and explore that it can be overwhelming, especially if you go with kids.",Absolutely Overwhelming
"January 12, 2020",I think you could spend a week here and not see it all. We spent a few hours and probably only saw 10% of the free galleries. Very crowded on the weekends. There is a movement to have some artifacts returned to their homes so you may see protestors. ,Very Interesting and Cool
"January 6, 2020","We (2 adults & 1 child) went to the British Museum on Dec. 27 2019. It was cool and interesting for me (the child ). I was very fascinated by the mummy and Rosetta stones exhibits. In my opinion, this is one of the best museums I’ve been to in my life because they have helpful audio guides. There are many entertaining and informative exhibits.( Obe, 11 )",It is huge! Plan to spend the better part of your day here!
"February 18, 2020","Oh my goodness, the queuing is set up to try and get you in efficiently.But once inside this beautifully immense space, you need time to properly walk and immerse yourself. It is huge here. Almost overwhelming.It has lots of space around exhibits and doesn't feel crammed.I didn't get enough time and would definitely come back. And it would be worth exploring over and over.",Mummies Galore!
"March 5, 2020","Having been to the Tutankhamum exhibition at The Saachi Gallery lately I felt compelled to write a review on my prior visit to the British Museum.  The Egyptian section is far more impressive than I imagined and the museum in general has lots of quirky things, like money making machines and clocks galore!  That roof over the central hall always amazes me too.  Will return.",A Must-See
"February 3, 2020","The British Museum is one of the most well-curated museums in the world and a must-see if you are in London. With everything from mummies to pieces of the Parthenon, you could spend days wandering around. Some of the exhibits are so spectacular that I left shocked I was able to view such renowned artifacts up close (i.e. the Rosetta Stone!). Go with friends, family, or even by yourself for a lovely day trip!",External tour guides are out of control
"August 28, 2023","The complete and utter lack of control of external tour groups made the visit completely unbearable. I counted (and filmed) seven tour groups yelling over each other in competition in one small space as one official tour given by a staff member was completely drowned out. Completely unacceptable working conditions for museum staff members. These same large unofficial tour groups allowed their group members to do whatever they liked (including climb onto of statues) because they don’t want to risk their tips and frankly don’t care about the locations they visit. It was lawless,  as there was complete disregard of any other visitor as they barrelled passed and raised their voices over other tour groups and did whatever they liked. No tour groups should be permitted access and only official museum tours should be permitted in line with majority of tourist attractions in Britain. I stayed for a couple of hours and found sections such as the Islamic art much better as the large groups avoided them. In these isolated areas you could enjoy the collections. Where you could find peace and quiet it is a brilliant and varied collection. A bit dated in places but with some TLC it could be improved upon. However I would not recommend this attraction until they ban external tour groups and tour leaders. It’s frankly ridiculous and the museum staff have my sympathies having to work in those conditions; putting up that that level of noise and disrespect.",Only 1 floor is open
"September 23, 2020","a little disappointing because only one floor is open and even then certain exhibitions were closed. I am assuming this was to lack of staff and/or due to current restrictions.Saying that it was still a good day out, with several interesting exhibits to see. The staff are friendly and helpful and we took our 8 month old and found the museum to be very family/baby friendly.",So much history!
"February 1, 2020","The museum is immense. We thought we'd spend most of the day there,  but our endurance gave out. I'd recommend planning just 2 hours a day there and do it in several days in between other activities. There were no lines to get in on a Friday morning in January. So many incredible things to see!",Definitely a must if you come London
"March 7, 2020","It's been over 10 years since I visited the British Museum and doesnt disappoint no matter how many times you go. A friend visiting from abroad enjoyed the many cultures that is captured here, and its definitely for someone who enjoys history and pretty for those art trips from school. Can be a bit boring for kids thou, but the scones at the cafe look super tasty if you get hungry just looking around. Remember to look up when you go inside, the glass ceiling is just spectacular and breathtaking.",A fantastic museum doing its best with Covid
"October 23, 2020","The British Museum is one of the top museums in the world. Not only does it house some of the world’s most important pieces but there is both a depth and width to its collection.The museum has reopened after lockdown however most of the collection isn’t on view (most of what’s normally on view - most of the collection isn’t on view normally). What you get to see is a mixture of the best of the best - things like the Elgin Marbles and the Rosetta Stone - and some things that just happened to be on a suitable, one way, route through part of the museum.Whilst what you can see is incredibly important you can’t see everything that you might want.I’ve been to the British Museum before and will certainly return. However I’ve now seen their post lockdown offering so I’m waiting until much more of the museum is open again.","Great way to spend a rainy day, or sunny for that matter"
"April 26, 2020","Amazing museum, sop much to see you can easily spend the whole day just wandering around and having a snack in cafe or restaurant inside the museum. Also the building itselself is beautiful. Easy to reach as well.",Disappointed
"February 8, 2022","I joined British Museum membership a month ago, I was told that the membership card will be posted to me, and I still not receive it yet. Sent a few emails and left message on their facebook page, totally useless, can't believe this is how they treat their member. If you thinking of joining their memberaship, think again.","Waste of money, you dont even need to buy a ticket..."
"August 6, 2023",The website states you need to buy a ticket and come at your allocated time slot as to not over crowd the museum...There is no one to check tickets...so you can walk right in (wasted money there) The place is over crowded so you're finding yourself pushed up against walls and monuments.Tour guides being groups push and shove you out of the way...100% avoid this place ,World Class Collections...excellent shops.
"September 6, 2022","I will not comment on the collections except to write that there is something for everyone. Wandering  around galleries by chance may bring delightful  surprises and discoveries but I think that reading in advance about the collections  in advance of a visit is advisable.  Leaving aside the collections displayed  I single out the excellence of the shops - they  hold ranges of varied, desirable, and affordable,  stock suitable for all ages.",WOW
"March 30, 2020","This place is huge and full of wonderful things. For free!!The building itself is impressive.There is a small section with something from last century however this museum is best for people who love ancient history, you could easily spend hours there.",Fascinating visit
"February 11, 2020","Whether you’re on a solo visit, with friends or family, the British Museum is always a great stop on your tour of London. There’s so much to see. Entrance was fairly quick through the security tent. Picking your time to visit may be sensible to avoid busy periods. ",A must see!
"June 23, 2020","This is an exceptional museum that I easily spent an entire day visiting. The works cover multiple styles, time periods and geographical area. The staff is professional, helpful and friendly. Visitors can easily go from one gallery to the next while going thru the museum and not have to double back to set to a missed gallery.",Peace in the British Museum
"October 1, 2020",Excellent time to visit BM as so quiet. Only ground floor open and you follow a trail finsihing at the de Waal pavilion housing books in exile. BM usually so crowded so lovely to be able to enjoy it in peace and discover objects that one would usually not notice.,"Amazing, gigantic museum!"
"April 19, 2022","There is just so much to explore at the British Museum! I recommend you spend a full day there (arrive early to avoid queues). Still you'll need to pick your favourite sections as the museum is so vast. I particularly recommended exploring the Egyptian section (Rosetta Stone, pharaohs' statues) and the Middle East section (Iran, Assyrian sphinx statues, etc.). Also check out the Lewis Chess set and the Greek section (Partheon and the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus). Every culture and era is represented with the most beautiful and fascinating items and statues!",Needs a couple of visits
"October 12, 2022",There is so much to see at that I strongly recommend a couple of visits to the museum. After a few hours the brain starts to become overwhelmed with information and visual stimulation...Greatly enjoyed the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles. (we later visited the Acropolis Museum in Athens to see the rest)Focused on early Greek and Roman exhibits and were not disappointed. Outstanding.,Excellent visit.
"February 8, 2020",Came on quick trip to London to visit Troy exhibition at British Museum. It was worth the trip.  Excellent exhibition which meant a lot to both of us firstly because we have visited the ancient site of Troy and  some sites in Greece associated with this period also because my husband is a classics student and has always been interested in this area of ancient history.  This was a very well put together exhibition with lots of exhibits.  We always visit the museum when we come to London always something to see whether or not there are exhibitions on. Great gift and bookshops also.,Sharing culture with a colleague 
"February 1, 2020","I had my operations director fly in from India for a review meeting and rather then share the delights of a rented office, I decided to hold our meeting at the British Museum while looking at the amazing artefacts. We walked the main galleries which are stunning and we had a very successful meeting.The artefacts really demonstrate the ingenuity of human kind and are humbling.",One of the world's must see museums
"August 21, 2022","This is a large museum and can seem overwhelming. The staff is excellent and will always help with suggestions and directions. The gift shop and bookstore are excellent. Entry is free, but most visitors leave 5 pounds or such as a donation. To see all of the museum, plan two or three visits.",Always a pleasure
"March 5, 2020","Quick call in on way back to train after an overnight stay. No matter how many times you go, there is always something new to see and the quiet within the museum is always a joy away from the hubbub of the city. Could always spend more time here",Amazing collection and free to enter
"February 1, 2020","I took a 14-year old child who found the mummies and Elgin Marbles very impressive.  The majority of galleries open at 10am, although you can gain access to the building before that.  The covered atrium is a feat of modern engineering.  There is good interpretation","A Magnificent Collection of Mummies, Antiquities and Art"
"November 28, 2021",The British Museum can easily hold its own with Le Louvre and the Smithsonians when it comes to ancient artifacts and history.  The Egyptology section is overwhelming in its presentation of mummies and items that date to the time of the Pharoahs.  The displays are informative and endlessly fascinating.The depth of the museum is impressive and easily worth a multi-day trip.,More than worth while - if you take your time
"September 27, 2022","After several trips to London this was our first time at the British Museum - and definitely not our last. As with other major and leading museums across the globe you either need to schedule several hours for your visit - or focus on specific parts of the exhibition. With around eight million objects, the number of items and antiquities from all eras of human history is mind-blowing, with the highlights certainly being the collection of Egyptian mummies and the Rosetta Stone. A personal highlight were the The Africa Galleries. Definitely worth more than one (two, three) visits for everyone vaguely interested in mankind's history and culture.",A tour around the world in 90 minutes
"February 12, 2020",I had already visited the Museum a long time ago. This guided tour was an opportunity to review the marvels that the British Museum has to show us and also the new additions in terms of building and exhibits. An excellent guide.A wonderful Museum ti visit again and again.,The history of the work under one roof
"October 6, 2020","This is one of the greatest museums the world. Its exhibits are all wonderful and it is well laid out. It has a number of iconic exhibits including the Rosetta Stone which is the first thing you see, and the frieze from the Parthenon. Its collection of artifacts from Ancient Egypt are particularly stunning. Access is limited just now, presumably due to Covid, but there is still plenty to absorb you for a couple of hours anyway. It is one of the ""must see"" places in London so you really must see it!",Astounding amount of history!
"April 25, 2022","We took a trip to London, ended up getting a hotel in Holborn, which was just two blocks from the British Museum. So it was super convenient and something we would have gone out of our way for anyway.The line outside was long but it moved quickly and efficiently. Notably security was not only productive but genuinely charming. The entrance was just stunning, the staircases and the rotunda genuinely gave us pause. The sheer depth of how much stuff was here was also intimidating. We had to get a map and actually figure out our plan of attack.For me the Egyptian exhibits were the highlights but literally every historical period and geographic area had amazing exhibits. I love weapons and they had them in spades, from primitive clubs to gorgeous inlaid swords.My only reservations were twofold. 1st, apparently every school in London brought their kids and they swarmed the place like locusts. I though British kids were a lot more civilized than Americans but not these ones!The other small reservation is that there are some exhibits that you have to pay extra to see. In this case it was Stonehenge. As we were going to the real thing I was okay but for the token price it would have been worth it.All in all, these small reservations did nothing to deflate the experience. I would go back again and spend another full day there!",Fantastic Museum
"October 17, 2022","I love the British Museum, especially the Egyptian Section. It is quiet and the rooms are very well organised. It is free so accessible to anyone which I think it is amazing for families and all people. If you want to support it you can easily make a donation. The queue looks long, but it is very fast so it takes only few minutes to access the museum itself. Booking is required even if free.",The British Museum visit
"January 4, 2020",The building itself is magnificent and galleries spacious so even when busy it is ok to walk with many.I wanted to visit to see the Egypt gallery as I have recently been at the Saatchi gallery to see the Tutankhamun exhibition.I was very disappointed to find two of the main rooms containing artefacts closed to the public until further notice(No date for reopening).The very least the Museum could do is advise on the website what is available and works that are taking place with restrictive accessThe artefacts that were on show were really good but I left a little flat and slightly annoyed.This is somebody who lives in London who can come back anytime so I feel for many of our foreign visitorsAnother annoying thing is the tour guides who seem to be both official and unofficial .Apart from my little issues I had a great time and I will be back to see the rest.,The most authorative museum in the world.
"January 18, 2020","This museum is the model for the Museums of the World with the widest spead of departments, and is the go to start if wishing to learn about any historical artefact anywhere.  I have recently visited its stunning exhibition about Troy, and I wish I had all the information on the exhibition before visiting the actual site which itself was rather disappointing in contrast to the fascinating museum display. Manyof the exhibits, especially the tomb carvings of the stories brought the myths to life so that it was possible to imagine what must have happened to cause the stories to be written.     ",Large Cultural Museum - FREE Admission 
"August 6, 2022","Cultural Museum with FREE Admission in London. Tickets can be reserved on line, but nobody even asked to see our  🎟 for admission. You can easily spend all day here! If you go in the summer ☀️ like we did, be aware that many of the rooms can be hot. The museum is very popular, so is quite crowded. There is SO much to see, it takes a minimum of 2.5 hours to go through exhibits quickly. ",Great Museum
"July 5, 2022","This is a must visit place when you in London.  The entrance of this museum is amazing, so many collections, and well displayed.The gift shops are wonderful, you get 10% off of your next purchase, so buy item one by one.Best of all the museum is free to entry, even it is free, you are treated as paid visitors, the workers are friendly and helpful, which gave a very good impression of my first visit to London.",One of the Premiere Museums of London
"January 29, 2020","London and the UK in general have a ton of museums to choose from. The British Museum is not to be missed. With a regular rotation of exhibits and some that are regulars you will see a range of art from around the world. There are excellent examples of Egyptian, Persian and Greek art and sculpture. This is a must visit when in London.",Exhibits worth seeing
"February 2, 2020","Extremely interesting exhibits on display. Just shows you, through the ages what man can do.  The carvings and statures are well preserved, just blows your mind away how old they really are. Free to visit. We made a donation, any amount accepted, helps to preserve the exhibits for future generations.  The building it self is worth seeing too, inner atrium is amazing, make sure you see it.",A must-see experience!
"October 28, 2023","We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the British Museum. We didn't expect the museum to be as big as it is - our visit was approx. 3 and a half hours. You have to book a free ticket online in advance to reserve a specific timeslot, however as no one checked our tickets when we entered, I'm not sure how the number of people are controlled as it can get quite busy inside.Not all of the exhibits hold the same level of interest - for example, some of the exhibits are just lots of pots which can get a bit boring after a while. But without a doubt, the best exhibits are Greece and Egypt. Even if you don't enjoy all the exhibits, the fact that this museum is free makes it a must-see experience for anyone. We had a great day out and would definitely recommend to anyone visiting London.",Endlessly fascinating museum
"March 27, 2023",Entry to the British Museum is free so you don't need to spend all day - you can come back another time. I visited many times when I lived in London and have been back on many return trips to London. This time we spent just an hour and looked at some Ancient Egyptian objects and some artefacts from the so-called Dark Ages. There is plenty for future visits! The back entrance is much less busy than the main one. Worth remembering when it is raining.,Quick visit having previously worked at the Museum
"February 14, 2020",Just popped in as worked at the Museum many years ago.  It’s an amazing place still. It’s great it’s still a free Museum and open to everyone.  Having visited several Museums in Europe it was noticeable that I didn’t see any labels to the artefacts in French or German they were just in English.  Worth visiting even if you only have an hour to spare.  ,Head to the Japanese room
"February 15, 2020","Fabulous building with amazing exhibits.  This time I visited the Japanese room which is one of the more remote areas of the museum, but worth the trip up the stairs.  One of the star pieces is a suit of Samurai armour which is so intricate and beautiful. ",It’s free and it’s great
"November 11, 2021","I was slightly over faced by the amount of impressive exhibits in the museum and have resolved to come back when I have more time to explore properly. Enjoyed the Lewis Chessmen (gallery 40) and the Rosetta Stone, plus the Egyptian mummies. Would suggest focusing on a few galleries rather than wandering aimlessly as we did! Clock room wasn’t operational so had to carry our coats which was a pain. Estimate 50% of guests were wearing masks.",Impressive Collection
"March 9, 2020","We visited here last week on our impromptu trip to London.  It has free entry which is brilliant and a vast array of collections from all around the world, with the highlight undoubtedly being the Mummies of Egypt. They are marvelous and seeing the remains so well preserved, along with the mummy of Cleopatra, it is a must see!It was exceptionally busy in the Mummies section but other than that it was brill. The foyer itself is awe inspiring, and really takes you back in terms of an architecture perspective!",Wonderful to see these priceless artefacts 
"March 5, 2020","I never fail to be in awe of the workmanship of these huge carved artworks from 2,000+ years ago. The Hall with Ancient Greek reliefs at one end and Asyrian gates still the other with Egyptian statues set out wonderfully through the centre. What’s not to love. We are so privileged to have these to see for free in our city.",A must-see London attraction.
"August 10, 2021","I'm sire many other reviewers have discussed the merits of the museum exhibits so I just wanted to add a quick note about accessibility.  The museum offers wheelchairs to people with disabilities.  Their website asks for people to reserve in advance, but due to poor planning on our part, we didn't get it done.  No worries though.  The staff was able to provide one for my wife, who walks with a cane.  Because of this kind gesture she was able to enjoy a much longer and more thorough visit than she normally would have done.  So glad they have thought of this.",Go with a plan of what you want to see
"May 12, 2022","So much to see and most artifacts are from Foreign countries so not sure why it's called the British Museum. I would recommend going with a plan otherwise you'll end up walking around aimlessly like I did. Found some very interesting things to look at. I found the creation of money from the beginning to now, particularly good",Brilliant and free
"March 2, 2020","I have been here several times over the years. There is a vast range of artifacts ranging from pre history to modern day.Considering this museum is free it's fantastic, They could charge and it would be totally fair. This place is educational for everyone and certainly shouldn't be missed.",Choose your exhibits
"January 18, 2020",You could spend days there as there is so much information artifacts and pieces of history. Lots to see and read and amazing insights in the past. Always busy and its free except certain special exhibits  ,British museum.
"June 20, 2020","It is amazing what can be learned in this place. There are many kinds of guides, it is advisable to go with one, it is enjoyed in a different way. Still this museum with free admission (through tips) is amazing, it has a bit of every great civilization and takes you to another world.",British Museum visit.
"October 9, 2022","Huge museum, lots of people, be prepared to stay in line to enter, but it moves fast.  If you are not bringing any bags (backpack, purse, bags) you just walk in without been screened.  Amazing collection of Greek, Macedonian and Egyptian cultures, the only problem was that some tourists will just get too close to some statues that is frigtenight that they might tip over it.  There is a restaurant in the top of the museum that serves amazing food.  The Museum shops had a great variety of nice gifts.",Brilliantly fascinating
"February 3, 2020","We had visited the British Museum before during a visit to London but knew we had only scraped the surface of the place.  When we saw there was a Troy exhibition on we decided to go back and we’re really delighted we did.  The exhibition was incredibly interesting and well done, bringing the whole story to life.If you’re in London it’s a must do",So much to see!
"June 29, 2021","Great place to visit but be warned, it's massive! We scheduled four hours for this visit but didn't even get through a quarter of what's there in that time. There is so much to see but, because of the size, it may be a little bit much for young children. Worth taking some water with you because it's a bit like a maze, once you start it""s kind of hard to get back to the central area where the cafe's located. ",A Cornucopia of World Treasures
"January 27, 2022","A cornucopia of world treasures, there is a slice of world history for everyone at this museum. I often use the British Museum as a litmus test for people I want to get to know better, as you can tell a lot about a person's character by what parts of history they are interested in and which artefacts they tend to look at the longest.I first went to this museum as a child a couple of decades ago and was fascinated by the ancient Egyptian section. As I grew up my tastes changed, and I now enjoy spending significant time looking around the Chinese, Mayan, Incan and Inuit sections learning more about cultures, beliefs and writing methods I never got the chance to learn about when younger. As I learn more about languages in relation to computers, the way that other pre-modern cultures used their own fascinates me and I always wonder what the world might have been had these become more dominant.I strongly recommend spending more than 5 hours, if not an entire day here. I have been going every couple of years for the past 2 decades and I still find unique insights from coming here. The artefacts on display are matched with clear explanations and dates explaining their relevance and context to each time period and room. There are places to sit down and rest if you do have tired feet, or aren't quite as mobile, and there is at least one café that offers cafeteria style food if you do find yourself hungry.If you're young, and are curious about everything, or older and wiser, and have read around history and literature, this museum has something for you.",Beautiful
"February 17, 2020","Extremely interesting. It captures the different aspects of everyday life of all the cities of the past and not. Interesting the approach to ancient works of modern installations, not as meaningless as happens in the modern niche. interesting is the part dedicated to the objects of daily life of the ancient Romans, to the marbles of the Parthenon, to the stele of rosetta..but also to the oriental civilizations. In addition to visit the top floor where there are the only cardboard that is left of Michelangelo.",A wonderful museum full of fantastic displays
"January 30, 2020","There is so much to see in this wonderful building, it is full of some of the most precious treasures from around the world. The building itself is worth visiting in it's own right, and the, now covered central hall is magnificent. The displays range from monumental to the small and delicate. it deserves to be visited more than once to fully appreciate it's contents.",Bit disappointed
"July 12, 2022","We enjoyed the Egyptian exhibit, however if my mother in law hadn't been with us we would have had to queue to get into the museum, one security guard waved us through the barrier, as she was suffering from heat exhaustion. Very few places to sit apart from the cafes, museum can be a bit of maze not very well sign posted, lifts seem not well sign posted and there don't seem to be many of them. The toilets I used were downstairs, I had to queue to use them, 2 cubicles were missing doors and could not be used, the sanitary bin was full to overflowing, it was obvious that they hadn't been checked or cleaned recently. When I went to complain I couldn't find anyone who seemed interested in doing anything about it, they stated they would TRY to speak to a cleaner. With the amount of visitors, covid infections on in the increase I would have thought that the toilets should be checked, cleaned and sanitary bins emptied on a regular basis.",Cool stuff: 5 stars; Organization: 3 stars
"December 16, 2023","We wanted to see the Rosetta Stone so made a reservation online for a day which we later discovered to be the kids' holiday from school, so the place was mobbed. So rule #1: don't go during the kids' holiday from school. Rule #2: don't bother with making an online reservation because you still have to queue up in the godawful long line that snakes around the entire building if you don't follow Rule #3: go as early in the morning as possible. We did manage to elbow our way through the hordes and see the Rosetta Stone, along with the Elgin Marbles and the Assyrian wing, which actually was our favorite part of our visit. We also loved seeing the Egyptian artifacts as we spent a chunk of time in Egypt touring including two visits to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The artifacts in London were beautifully curated and in pristine condition - quite the cream of the crop (imagine that).So, bring your patience if you go on a popular day, but aside from that, worth a visit.  ",Price is right
"November 16, 2022",One of the free things to do in London. Enjoyed stepping back in time. Ramses bust is very impressive. You will miss things go twice it’s free. Only downside was original Rosetta Stone was moved to a pay section of museum. A copy was in another section. ,A must for anyone visiting London.
"August 30, 2020",The British museum houses an extraordinary collection of fascinating artefacts from all over the world. The Egyptian section is fantastic for kids (and adults) there is so much to see. It is beautifully curated and well worth the visit. I could spend days in there.,Little boring but interesting
"August 18, 2023","One of the biggest museums I've visited in my life and I must say it's really big. Full of objects and information about the Egyptian civilization. I must say that anyone who doesn't master the theme or doesn't like it will end up finding it boring (my case). The best, for me, was the gift shop. The most time consuming process was security, since tickets were purchased online",Amazing Museum!
"October 10, 2022","If you appreciate history, you can't go to London without visiting the British Museum. The original Rosetta Stone is here. It's a large museum so you'll have to pick and choose what you really want to see if you have a limited time. Cafe and gift shop options inside also good.",Amazing
"April 12, 2021",Can't get enough of this place.  I love to wander round and take in the breathtaking pieces from across time and the world. The grandness of the Great Hall as you enter the building sets you up for the magnificence which is to follow.,Amazing Museum of World History
"August 24, 2022","We loved both the Greek and Egyptian sections of the museum.  Having been to Greece and seen the Parthenon, it was neat to see the parts of the Parthenon that made their way to England.  The number of Egyptian mummies and Assyrian sculpture were amazing!  Although we could have taken a full day to see this museum our feet were tired after little more than half a day.",£10 cafe meal deal not working
"April 27, 2023",Beware the widely advertised £10 meal deal in the ground floor cafe bars is not valid. As of 27/04/2023 the signs are new but their toll systems have not been update to allow it. Whatever you buy will be at the listed price per piece. ,Timed Ticketing System Is An Epic Fail!
"August 10, 2023","The timed ticketing system is not fit for purpose in its current form.  There is no point offering this system where a time is chosen, and then consumers are expected to turn up at their allocated time and then join a 2 hour queue to gain access to the museum.Museum management need to fix this quickly as the public is being denied reasonable access to the museum.I have now missed my planned opportunity to visit the museum.",Really interesting
"August 19, 2021",A must if you are going to London. Really interesting exhibits in a spacious building. We went as a couple and then back the next day with our 7 year old who particularly enjoyed the Egyptian exhibits. A shame that not every gallery is currently open but means we’re even more likely to return.,Impossible
"November 23, 2021","We had always wanted to visit the British Museum but fitting it into our very full schedule was always a challenge . However we managed to organize a Day in London on a Saturday in July . Unfortunately we were unaware that this was the 1st Day of the Summer Holidays . When we arrived we found that there were thousands of People trying to enter the museum . Entrance is Free and is booked on their Website . Everyone must go through a Security Check before entering the Museum . The large Entrance is up a Flight of wide steps . Which meant negotiating large numbers of People sitting on the Steps , contrary to the signs Not to sit on the Steps . They need to move the people on from the steps as it was so crowded . Inside was no better . It was ridiculous . So many people . It was impossible to spend time studying exhibits . We stuck it out for just an hour and gave up .",Brilliant for all ages.
"October 1, 2023","Throughly enjoyed our visit to the British museum. There is a huge collection of varied artefacts to see. We were particularly taken by the Greek, Assyrian, Chinese & Indian sections. Plenty to see for all ages, lots of interesting facts to read or simply just walk around and look at the displays. You can easily see as much or as little as you please as the map highlights its top things to see around the museum. The cafe area can become quite busy so I’d suggest planning time to visit if needed. Although we visited during summer it was very hot in some sections so would suggest a portable fan if you’re able to take one with you just for comfort.","From Sutton Hoo to Assyrian reliefs, there's everything here"
"August 20, 2022","We went to see the Sutton Hoo exhibits because of The Dig. It's fascinating, not least because it shows the international trading that was taking place even 1500 years ago.We then moved on to look at the Assyrian exhibits. It's amazing to think that you're looking at real materials 3500 years old, and you can see amazing detail in the reliefs.I guess it's obvious, but the British Museum really does justify many visits, not just once for a couple of hours.",Excellent
"August 1, 2021",I often revisit and always make for the Assyrian Rooms. The wall panels are interesting if you spend time examining them. Lots of detail. And the shop has many books and other things to buy. But you cannot do the whole museum in one go. It is too big. Another part that is of interest is the Clock collection. I really do recommend that you visit this part of the collections.,Only for the British history
"February 23, 2020","The museum itself was very nice, however, some the exhibits cost an extra fee which not knowing how good they were we did not partake.  The rest of the museum was extensive and the local exhibits of medieval England was on point, though they should clean the jewelry to show off the shine.  The other stuff, you can see in most museums, like mummies etc.  Main point, when England is having a heat wave, this museum is not airconditioned.  ",Must See!
"July 5, 2023",A great way to spend half a day. There are lots of amazing things in the collection - so many that it’s difficult to see and properly appreciate them all in one visit. Entrance is by donation and there are lots of options for tours. We went right when it opened and the crowds were very light for the first few hours.,A brilliant visit
"January 15, 2020","This is an absolutely outstanding museum with so much to see, a day simply is not enough to take in the volume of exhibits and information. It’s laid out across 3/4 floors and they are huge, very well maintained and extremely clean.Lots of staff around to help and they have an app which is excellent to give you an idea of each exhibit hall you enter what it relates to. Restaurant and Coffee shop on site and lots of places to rest your weary feet.Enter via the Montague Street entrance if open as less busy than the main entrance.Does get extremely busy so be warned it won’t be quiet.",Superb
"October 19, 2022","I spent 6 hours in the Museum and enjoyed every minute of it. The place is filled to the brim with beautiful artefacts to marvel at, with interesting placards to explain it all. I went to one of the paid exhibition, which was even more amazing as the curation allowed you to make better sense of the story behind everything and how it all ties together. Take a sandwich and a drink with you to eat in the Great Court to save a little money. Thoroughly recommend. I want to go back the next time I'm in London","Busy, but efficient. "
"July 25, 2023","We visited on a Saturday so queues to be expected. Whilst we did wait in line we managed to get through it quickly and easily, the baggage check being great - the gent not at a station pulled us over as I only had my small handbag, checked it and waved us through. Excellent! We picked up a map of the Museum, as it was so crammed with people, we just did the sections we were interested in and skipped the rest. Having room numbers on the map was helpful to navigate ourselves around.Toilets are well sign posted and maintained, and the gift shop plentiful and staff friendly. ",Whats British about it ?
"October 25, 2023","My wife and I visited this museum after a somewhat deflated visit to the Victoria & Albert museum the day before.We were after exhibits of British life and customs through the ages with artifacts and costumes/daily life etc.Dont buy tickets on line as it is free - if you want to offer a donation, do so inside. We queued  for some time but that was okay.The auditorium is huge - very impressive, but as others have said, it shouldnt be there to win awards for its architectural merits. The layout is still confusing despite a free 'map' (compounded by sparse information of where you actually are and which rooms go where after). Having said that, the staff available are helpful and pleasant for advice.My primary gripe is that this is the British Museum and, in my opinion, should reflect the history and heritage of this island throughout the ages up until the present. Instead, it is full of relics, sculptures, jewellery, pottery, etc, salvaged/procured from around the world (mainly Egypt and Asia) by affluent collectors from the @victorian era.It took me half an hour to come across the word 'Britain' in a display somewhere upstairs !There were so many rooms containing exhibits from Korea, China, Egypt and elsewhere that I felt it was just a celebration of everyone elses culture except 'ours'.I am no zenophobe but I felt all the museum represented was that the British were good at 'obtaining' artefacts in favour of our own culture !Nicely displayed and clean but not actually 'British' at all !!!If the British Museum doesnt contain any historical",A must to visit in London
"March 1, 2023",I have the privilege of seeing my ancestors great history (Cyrus the great) cylinder and i spent most of my time in museum in Persia’s part and then in Peru exhibition. For such a huge museum and beautiful exhibitions we didn’t need to pay and it makes it more interesting as you didn’t feel rushed while being there. _good café_polite staffs _long lines but not long time waiting _free entrance _complete collections _highly recommended,Sardine can
"August 17, 2023","This place needs more organization, I get that entry is free, but they need a little more regulation with how many people can enter. The building jam packed with people.We went mainly to see the Egypt section, but due to the number of people, we didn't see everything we wanted, and I thought there would be more mummies on display, maybe it depends on the time of year. Just be advised for those sensitive the warmer temperatures the build doesn't seem to have A/C so some exhibits can get extremely hot depending  on how many people are in it",Free general entry
"June 29, 2021",Quite simply the biggest & most interesting collection of artefacts from around the world making its name somewhat ironic. It’s far from a museum of British history rather a fine art collection of British collectors. It’s not actually that inspiring or even exciting and I could understand why the hordes of primary school children looked completely bored out of their little minds! It is just room after room of set exhibits after all with no interactive elementsZ After a while the exhibits look the same which is a reflection of how alike human civilisations of the past were and how we have  more in common than not today irrespective of where the exhibit originated from. You can spend hours upon hours here reading all the exhibits and listening to the audio information or you can whizz round in just over an hour as we did and still receive a feast for the eyes.,"Great museum, amazing exhibitions however train the waiters better, please."
"December 18, 2022","We had so much fun walking though the exhibition even if you keep your coat on, in wintertime as it is, do to the temperatures they need to have, really chilly in certain parts of the museum e.g. Mummy/ ancient Egypt. Visit well worth alone for the amount of things you can and will see as you visit it.However, we felt sorry for the staff at the pizzeria - the food is great and a clear recommendation and at a price point where you say - not that much higher in comparison to the restaurans around, however they needs to be better coordinated in terms of responsibility and knowing what the actually do.",It’s free! Worth a visit
"February 16, 2020","Last time I came here was on a school trip some 30 years ago, so it’s changed a lot in that time.Depending on what you’re interested in you could spend hours looking around.The more general interest exhibits (think Egyptian mummies) can get very busy, so be aware there will be lines.",Colossal Museum Best Seen When one has limited time
"April 9, 2020","The British Museum is one of, if not the best museum in the world. I have the opportunity to visit only two hours to spare. This was just perfect for me and helped me narrow my areas of interest. It has vast ancient Egypt galleries and Hellenic works of art which always peaks my interest. Plenty of areas to stop for a quick bite perfect to keep moving. To have anything more in the way time, one would be tempted to spend eternity there. ",A storehouse of information
"March 22, 2020","Went over to the museum to look for literature on a specialised area of philately. The staff were helpful in exploring my area of focus and providing me with the books required to further my knowledge base. What was interesting was that I could scan material and email it to myself without any charge. Quite impressed with the amount of information that is available, if you know what to look for, with helpful staff to point you to what to look for.",Well organised and seeing some treasures anew
"September 30, 2020","The British Museum is a true Treasure Trove of objects which we have visited on a number of occasions, always seeing something new, and concentrating on certain areas because it would be overkill to see too much in a day. In London for a couple of days, we booked a lockdown visit. A special one way trail on the main floor has been devised which takes you through many of the highlights and as always, opened our eyes to items scarcely seen before. Well done the BM, a treat.",Astounding collection of ancient history
"February 29, 2020",Avoiding the ethical debates that occur surrounding some of the artifacts contained here. My daughter is studying the ancient Egyptians this term and ancient Greece next so we decided to bring her to look at the corresponding exhibits.Visiting on a Saturday we expected queues to get in however entering via Russell Square side entrance we had no issues at all and quickly made our way to the Egyptians. The fact that you can be stood centimetres from antiquities from over 1000 years ago boggles the mind. The information presented was concise and allowed my daughter to carry out the research she required. We spent a good few hours here and barely scratched the surface of other departments and collections. There's literally thousands of specimens from across history that we did not see on this visit and look forward to seeing in the future.,"Stunning, Vast and Comprehensive"
"August 4, 2023","While constantly thinking that much of this collection should be repatriated to home countries, I was very happy that such a comprehensive collection of art, decor, jewelry, and more, spanning from the beginning of human civilization and across the globe. We only spent one day, and it got VERY crowded fairly quickly. We did not buy the audio tour, and were OK with the good descriptions throughout. We did think that a guided tour may be quite worth the price.",Disgusting verbal abuse from staff and no toilet access! AVOID
"July 18, 2023","The museum itself is great, however at 4:30pm, 30 minutes before the museum closes, all the toilet shut and you are directed to the front entrance to use the toilet. I got redirected 3 times before asking someone who completely refused to let me use the toilet. Then this man let another pregnant women go to use the toilet and when I announced I was pregnant too he laughed in my face and said no I’m ‘just fat’! As a 25 week pregnant women I was extremely applauded and disgusted by this comment, let alone the disrespect of letting another pregnant women who was not much further along than myself go to the toilet while refusing me. When I expressed my disgust and demanded to speak to a manager the security man then decided to let me go to the toilet. Once through I was stopped by yet another worker told I could not go. After explaining the whole situation she still was resistant to letting me use the toilet but eventually did, where I met a queue of people inside the toilet anyway! This whole situation for anyone is appalling let alone being verbal abuse by staff. Because of this experience I will never return to the British Museum and am extremely disappointed that they would employe verbally abusive staff members. So if you do want to visit don’t expect to use the toilet facilities within the last hour of opening time and if you happen to be pregnant get ready for being called fat instead!",Some Disappointments
"November 7, 2023","The Museum has plenty of interesting things to see and more than can be covered in a few hours. If traveling from afar, I suggest some research before you go so you can focus on what interests you. There were some disappointments however, which indicate no matter how well you think you have planned, it can all fall in a heap when the organisation doesn't live up to expectations. We had pre-booked tickets, and I highly recommend that you do, even though they are free. Despite tickets, you have to line up with everyone else, a line that extended to the end of the block. Once you reach the gates things move quicker as you are sorted into ticket and non-ticket holders. My focus was to visit the Parthenon Marbles. To my disappointment the gallery was closed even though there was no indication of this in the inforation we received the day prior to our visit or on the website. The websites was still announcing the gallery was opening at 11am and it was listed on their list of ""Available Galleries"". I asked a staff member about access and was informed the gallery had been closed all week and they didn't know why or when it would re-open. Another disappointment was the App. The free information was very general. The additional information, I was hoping for, was locked and required a fee to access. I resorted to searching the internet. I suspect the information I found was less bias. I was also disappointed by the lack of engagement by staff in the galleries. Most were seated and many were on their devices. Apart from the entry process, the museum seemed to cope with the crowd. Lines for the cafe and toilets were satisfactory. Displays were mostly easy to access and were well presented, although some information was too far away to be read, either with or without reading glasses. ",A full day
"January 30, 2020","Arriving at the British museum we were not really sure which way to go . But soon found out way. There is so much to see and on so many levels , you need a good day to cover it all. We spent half the day here but it was well spent . Lots of stairs to help you keep fit , but there is also lifts . Great opportunity to take some wonderful pictures to keep as a memory as there is so much to see you will forget half . Toilets throughout and places to grab something to eat and drink. Free to enter , but if there are certain exhibits want to see there is a cost . Great day out all in all if your interested in things from the past .",Superb and so much to see
"September 9, 2021","We visited the British Museum recently to see the Nero Exhibition. The British Museum is one of the top attractions in London and their exhibitions are always worth attending. The existing exhibits such as the Egyptian Mummies, Viking artefacts, etc are always worth revisiting. You can easily spend days in the British Museum because there is so much to see.",Incredible Collection
"July 5, 2022","This was one of the most incredible museums I have ever visited. From the Rosetta Stone to the Eqyptian collection with mummies, there is SO much to see! I highly recommend breaking it up into two halves (maybe 1.5 to 2 hours for each half), especially if you have children. While it's busy, the cafe has pretty good food and espresso. I also recommend saving time to visit the gift shop - they have really cool sourvenirs that are relatively reasonably priced. Given that this museum is free, I would say this is a must do when visiting London.",Unmissable
"March 27, 2022","Today I only had about 30 mins to skim through the British Museum and that’s a shame because I could have easily spent a whole day there and more.Each section is divided into different cultures, and the collection is amazing. There were loads of things I’d want to go back and have a proper look at.The building itself is beautiful. That might even have been my favourite part, the central part of the building has an incredible dome ceiling with plenty of natural light.I will be back!",Lost a lot of charm
"September 22, 2023","This used to be such a great museum ten years ago but a museum is more than just its current exhibition. We went to the China exhibition which was wonderful, informative and beautifully thought out but the rest of our experience was dire. The soulless,dirty cafe,where a submarine cheese and ham sandwich costs £11. The tables are uncleared,the staff indifferent and the space undefined. I believe Benugo run it,as they do so many in London. Also,please get your loos regularly cleaned. For a renowned museum your standards of cleanliness and value for money in the cafe are terrible.",MUST SEE !!!
"April 30, 2022","The British Museum is both an architectural beauty and a trove of some of the world's most noted antiquities. Its an archaeological paradise. An overwhelming museum filled with history from around the world. I've never been to a museum like this where there are so many objects from other countries, Worth as much time as you have available. Six hours was not enough for me!!",Family friendly Museum mission
"June 3, 2021","We booked into the British Museum as my son (7) has never visited before. The one way system is easy to follow and we used the Museum mission activity available on the website (free WiFi access at the museum). The activities upped the interest and enjoyment for us all and made us look at the artefacts in a different way, with details we otherwise would have missed. We didn't get time to do it all before our tummies started to rumble so will be making a return visit. Our only complaint was access to toilets whilst on the one way system was difficult, but staff and volunteers were very helpful in their guidence.",British Museum
"September 10, 2020","So many artifacts from Egypt and Ancient Greece! The one-way system to provide social distancing is set up very well. While parts of the museum are not open yet, it is still worth a visit. It looks like they are adding new exhibits constantly to keep you coming back.","Amazing Place, FREE and Friendly!"
"February 23, 2020","It's a long while since our last visit and decided to take our two nieces for a wander round. There was a long queue, as it was school holidays and a Saturday, but one of the staff noted my eldest niece is pregnant and allowed us straight through - that was really appreciated as she would have struggled to queue that long.A day is not enough to see everything, but you can get a flavour and see amazing artifacts from all corners of the globe - including the Rosetta Stone.Just have a visit and let the history soak in.",Very crowded
"April 27, 2023",It’s a wonderful museum but spoilt by the sheer numbers inside. We booked tickets in advance and arrived at 10.30 on a Monday morning. All those who had booked were held in a long queue to go through security and those who hadn’t booked went straight in. Nobody checked our tickets at all so we need not have booked. Inside it was very busy so we headed for the upper floors to try and escape the crowds. However there were crowds everywhere and our children 8 and 10 were uncomfortable. We persevered and did manage a few galleries. The Sutton Hoo treasure is outstanding as are the Egypt galleries. If you are going you need to be there as it opens and carefully plan your route in advance.,Arrive early
"May 2, 2022","Make sure you turn up WAY before your time slot, especially if it is early morning when it opens. The line to get into the museum snakes around two roads. We were so excited to visit, but the line to get in was so long, we had to skip it! Hopefully next time..",Awful experience.
"August 2, 2023","What an absolute disgrace, farce and disappointment. What is the actual point of booking tickets to ensure a controlled flow of footfall through the museum when, in actual fact, it was a free for all. Tickets not checked. Museum packed so much that seeing an exhibit was impossible but much worse than this is that it was a health and safety nightmare. Spent 15 minutes in there unable to move. There’s no organisation management.",A must see in London
"June 9, 2022",There isn't enough good things to say about this place.  It's a great place for all ages and free to enter!  The exhibits bring you back in time and they are so well done you have to read it all.  This is our second time here and it never disappoints.  The security queues can be a bit long but if you have a family they will move you to a shorter queue.  Give yourself plenty of time here because there is something for everyone here!,Awesome collection
"March 12, 2023","We, 2 of us, we down in London to catch a show, so stopped at the British Museum on the way to the theatre to look around for an hour or 2. You could spend all day there. We tried the 1 hour self guided tour, to see the highlights, but kept getting distracted by everything else. We started in the Oriental section and South Asian section, both of which were fascinating. The whole museum is awesome, and awe inspiring! We visited on a saturday morning in March from 10.30 till 12.00, before lunch and a matinee show. It was quite crowded so you can't get around quickly.",The Babylonian and Chinese Galleries are excellent
"March 12, 2022","We targeted two galleries - the Babylonian Gallery first and then the Chinese Gallery. The Babylonian Gallery is amazing - the quality of the art work, the exhibit are all very impressive and genuinely deserve time. I continue to be amazed by the skill of the craftsmen and the work.The Chinese gallery provides a very helpful survey of Chinese art and culture with some stunning example of pottery, Tang Dynasty Horses and Camels and of course some amazing pictures....there is a lot here that repays some attention and careful consideration. Take time and walk through and enjoy.",Too overcrowded.
"July 13, 2023","It would have been good if not so over crowded.  Lots of interesting exhibits to see but having to constantly manage the huge numbers - was especially difficult when with young children so the visit was spoiled.  The café was full so not possible to take a break.  Also a concern was safety if an emergency arose, due to the amount of visitors allowed in.",Best Value and must see while in London
"December 28, 2022","This place is huge and lot of things to see. With the free admission, it's just an amazing value that every tourist to London should not skip. Make sure to make online reservation beforehand and to get the free paper map at the Information Desk. I purchased the £6 Museum guide that also includes the color map up front. The guide is nicely done and worth the price. One can easily spend few hours here. If under time constraint, I would identify the room numbers I'm interested at from the map and tackle those first. In the morning, we needed to wait in line outside the entrance but the line went fairly quickly.",Incredible but crowded 
"August 27, 2023",The British Museum is one of the things you must see if you are in London.The sheer scope and variety of artifacts is mind boggling.My husband and I  spent three hours and that only covered a portion of areas.Things to keep in mind are that the lines for the ladies restrooms are extremely long and the museum is very crowded which is unfortunate but to be expected.There is no a.c so with that many people it was pretty toasty even in a building of that size.We had booked a specific time but no one checked ticket times.,"Lots of stuff to see related to history, very crowded."
"May 10, 2023","I only had time for about 2-3 hours at the British Museum, but you could easily spend an entire day here because this place is HUGE.  Most of the exhibits cover history of different civilizations like Egypt, Greece, Asia, among others.  There's a lot of stuff to read and artifacts to look at.  The Rosetta Stone is located here as well, which was pretty cool to see in person.  It does get pretty busy, especially considering admission is free.  If you've got the time, definitely worth checking out if learning about history is your thing.",Two very helpful staff
"August 8, 2021","I visited to see the Becket exhibition, which was very good. There was also an Iron Age sword I wanted to see. I got confused trying to find my way to the Iron Age gallery, one staff member I asked was not helpful at all, he muttered in reply to my query, did not seem interested. However, the young woman in the Iron Age area was completely the opposite, very helpful and pleasant, making sure that I found what I wanted. And another member of staff was most helpful when I was trying to find my way to the exit. I know the job of museum attendant can be boring, and people can be irritating, perhaps some staff need extra training.",Queues
"November 4, 2023","The first thing you will encounter when visiting the British Museum are the queues outside. These will move fairly swiftly so don’t be put off. You might consider mitigating those queues by bookjng a time slot to visit online. This is free and will provide you with an emailed entry ticket. So far so good. Once you get the other side of the railings you will be presented with three lanes. One for British Museum members, one for those with time specific entry tickets and those who’ve just rocked up unannounced. What you need to know is that at the end of the queues is a bag check. If you take the members lane you will whizz past the other queues. No one asks to see any proof of membership. At the end of the members lane it simply merges with the lane for those with timed entry tickets. Again no one is there to check anything. You’ve now saved yourself about half an hours wait. Once you get inside the covered white tent like area no one looks at your membership card or your timed emailed tickets.  No checks whatsoever. All that happens in this area is a security bag check and that’s it. Sadly,  I did what I thought was the responsible thing and applied for a time slot, got my ticket emailed and joined the queue for the ticket holders.  I needn’t have bothered. This is just a bag check for everyone regardless of which ticket you hold or indeed no ticket at all. It’s up to you and your conscience which one you go for and how much you like standing in a queue in the rain for no apparent reason. PS All the gallery rooms from number 50 upwards are shut. That’s all the Greek, Roman and Egyptian exhibits. Didn’t see any notice on the web site warning that one of the most popular attractions is out of action. It’s a great experience and well worth the visit. These are all minor inconveniences in the great scheme of things. Talking of conveniences, if your are female please visit the loo before coming here. The queues are horrendous as there aren’t enough female toilets.",Huge Disappointment/Major Sections Closed
"August 15, 2023","I have to say our visit to this museum may have been our greatest travel disappointment ever. Unfortunately for us ( and all other visitors that day in May, 2023), the museum chose to close THREE major areas on the same day. We were unable to access the Egyptian mummies, the entire Assyrian section, and major exhibits in the Greece section. This is absolutely, completely unacceptable. I understand the need to close sections for maintenance and cleaning. But 3 major sections on the same day? Unforgivable. Unfortunately, we may never get back to old London Town, but if we do, we won’t waste our time here. I strongly suggest you call ahead before you go to avoid the unforgettable disappointment we experienced. Good luck…..",Still great despite ground floor access restrictions
"January 15, 2023","Still way too much to see and as always too many people makes seeing some of the exhibits challenging but this is still one of my favourite places in London.I hadn't been here for a few years but most of the favourites are still there, some of the Egyptian statues and most notably the Rosetta Stone are in the Heiroglyphics Exhibition, I hope to see those again in the coming weeks but there is so much else to see. The route through the museum ground floor to the Egyptian Room 4 has been restricted as has some of the Assyrian exhibits, the route for the masses takes you through Greek and Roman periods to get to the Egyptian statues so it feels a bit disjointed from a chronological perspective. I'm not sure if this is a Covid Hangover or there was some genuine maintenance going on. Overall a minor detraction but hopefully the freedom of the restrictions will get restored for access to one of the jewels in the crown of the BM.",One of the few positives of Covid
"March 31, 2022","For some reason, probably Covid, the musrum was less crowded than usual. One could actually see the exhibits without having to push one's way to the front of a horde. Made the visit much more enjoyable.",Beautiful masterpieces
"March 6, 2020","The Museum is huge and you can spend a couple of hours there. There a cafeteria where prices are not too crazy. It's also not too crowded, as people tend to sparse throughout the rooms. Good for the general UK and European history.",Simply Unmissable!
"November 5, 2021","Visited here on a recent trip to London when my wife and I were stuck for something to do and it was nearby. I hadn't been here since I was a child, so only had very vague memories of the place. But I am so glad that we went because it was absolutely amazing!Only intended to spend a couple of hours there before going shopping in Oxford Street but ended up being here half the day and still didn't see everything on offer, this really is a place that you need to dedicate an entire day to!The Egyptian section was a particular highlight for me and I was very impressed by the food served in the cafe too, much better than any other museum I have been to.",My favourite location in London
"January 16, 2023","I always make time for the museum when visiting London. The Museum is one of my favourite places on earth. Recently I spent the entire day there. There is ample space, a good coat check (small fee), restuarants, etc.The exhibits change over time and everything is very well laid out but it is huge.The gift shop is massive so take some time as I believe it is one of the nicest places to shop in London. There is so much variety and all profits go back into the museum.",Enjoyable!
"April 25, 2023",This museum is huge! I could spend days here learning. The exhibitions are really well done and it is quite easy to move around the museum despite a queue that went around the block at opening. I got my Rosetta Stone fix!,Tourist trap
"June 27, 2022","I didn't particularly enjoy my experience at the British Museum. Other than the Rosetta Stone & a couple of other things, the majority of the museum encompassed rooms filled with the exact same pottery. The museum stank of fried cheese and onions from the cafes and restaurants dotted around. A hilarious touch is the pizzeria they've planted in the middle of an exhibition 😂. Far too overcrowded to actually enjoy some of the rooms & get a look at things, I'd rather go to a museum in which I can look at things without being shoved or pushed out of the way by noisy tourist groups. There are better places in London.","Just so much to see, you can't see it all in one visit"
"September 13, 2023","It's hard to comprehend just how much history is stored in this wonderful museum... and it's free (but donations are politely encouraged). There will always be crowds of visitors and the main attractions such as the Rosetta Stone will be packed, but there is just so much to see, particularly if you go without an agenda, I find something new everytime I visit. I like to wander aimlessly and see what catches my attention. I do then download the map and check that I've not missed anything I particularly wanted to see. Nearest tube is Russell Square (Piccadilly line), but I enjoy the 20-25 minute walk from King's Cross. Opens at 10am, just right for a leisurely start, and a gentle walk through Russell Square gardens taking in a coffee shop on the way.",The Ancient World in One place
"January 27, 2020","What a stunning place! Extraordinary collection from old Egypt, Africa, Greece ... The Rosetta Stone, the Parthenon frescoes, antique sculptures ... so many to see and so many ... people! Take your time even though the museum is relatively small vs other renowned museums.",You may miss the Becket exhibit
"July 11, 2021","A very disappointing visit to the Becket exhibit. It was shallow, not informative, not insighful and childish. All in all it was  like a very well executed high school project.So much more could have been shown re Becket's rise to the chancellorship and then to the Archbishopric. Much more could have been told about how and why Becket incurred such anger on King Henry's side. Much more could have been inferred from the whole affair regarding the place of church and state, Protestant and Catholic, and the present day balance in the UK, where there's officially no separation of church and state whereas the British are some of the least religious people in the free world. Something went seriously wrong in the preperation of this exhibition.Regarding other exhibits, where many parts were sealed off, I feel it's not fair to judge at this time.",Just like all the other amazing museums in London
"July 29, 2021",The museum had a beautiful interior and exterior. It had a lot to show as well in terms of history. I would suggest bringing a hand-held fan as it was stuffy inside the museum.   It was 27 degrees on the day we went that they had to close the roman exhibit due to the heat. Other than that I would recommend visiting this magnificent place.,Overwhelming amount to take-in
"June 3, 2022","We allocated only 1/2 day to the museum and that was a good move. Why you ask? Because there is simply way too much to take in everything on one visit. If I lived in London I could easily see a weeks worth of visits to read every description and study every exhibit. Limiting our time to 1/2 day meant it was time to leave after we were all saturated. It's a great museum and I am glad we went. Be aware there are two entrances a front that I understand is usually crowded, and a ""back"" that is less crowded. Glad we chose the later and simply walked in. Be prepared to run your bag thru a security check.",A bit disappointing.
"September 8, 2022","There was a wide range of exhibits but the building is huge and not always well signposted. Lifts were few and far between and the interior of the building was somewhat stark. Probably better to visit this museum prior to some of the architectural splendour of the National Gallery, St Paul’s Cathedral, etc.",The Spotlight tour will open your eyes to Ancient Egypt.
"September 28, 2023","I was visiting the museum and came across the spotlight tour about death in ancient Egypt, In the Egyptian gallery.Our guide,Douglas was knowledgeable, friendly and most well informed.(He even made a couple of ancient Egyptian jokes- not easy !)He made everyone fell included and had close up pictures to illustrate his talk.We moved around the gallery and he showed us items and symbols that we would have missed had we just been wandering through.He spent 20 minutes after the talk answering questions from his audience, which he had no problem answering- he clearly has a passion for his subject.Highly recommended- can’t wait to go back for more.",Not the best
"July 10, 2023","For all the free things to do I would give this a miss. I felt the signage/information didn't say much about where things came from. It was far too busy to be able to look. We booked tickets but no one checked them and you still had to join a queue which seemed totally pointless, also it was so busy when you got inside.",World Class
"June 17, 2021","There is no museum like it. The British Museum is an art, archaeology, sculpture and decorative treasure. So many things from Egypt including the Rosetta Stone (that's how we know what hieroglyphs say). Have to see it. CAN'T miss it.","Must be there , never miss one of the best museum in the World"
"February 11, 2020","Spare at least 3 hr to visit this place , they will bring you back in time from mummy to present , from Africa to Asia. Must visit zone about Egyptian history and Greek-Roman Exhibition. Pls come early to avoid issue OOS of head phone service.",Incredible Experience..
"November 11, 2021","One of the greatest museums in the world.  Remarkable & unmatched.   Because Britian kind of ruled the world in the 1800s & early 1900s, it did take art fromeverywhere.  When you realize that, and the quality and originality of the art and historical objects you will realize how great this place is.  From ancient Greek artto original books written by monks in the 1400s to Syrian Art from the middle east, it is here.  This is a world class great place...  In London you got to visit it.What is in this museum, is beyond  description.  ...Go there and see for yourself..  Then, you will know about the true greatness of....The British Museum.",Museum deserve more than seven ⭐
"December 25, 2022","This is one the best museum. This is very huge museam needs at least more hours to see or can see in 2/3 days while reading all details. 3/4floors all rooms are very big. This is for all ages museum. Like students, family's, seniors, youngsters. All will enjoy. Lots of collection and details of many countries. Collection of things are so good. Just see that. Their is fast moving ques. Can take atleast half an hour or more. If you r artist or designer take a pen and paper to gets best design and ideas. They have facilities of water washrooms and coffee areas. Can take so many pictures. Watch this museam with intrest, it's really good one.",A record of written human history
"July 4, 2023","The breadth of displays encompassing human history was just something that's difficult to plan on when you only have a half a day for a visit, while on vacation. This museum warrants multiple visits. I only had about three hours to spend on a Sunday and so tried to see as much as I could. The Egyptian display was very crowded, but the mummies were worth it. Other highlights were the Persian, Greek, Roman, Japanese, and Chinese antiquities. And finally the timekeeping exhibit.Entry is free and it's close to Russell Square and Tottenham tube stations, and 10 minutes south of Euston train station.",What an amazing building
"April 25, 2022",We only wanted to visit here to see the Egyptian History sections. Everything on  display was perfectly presented and had a very informative description next to it. I only wish i had more time to further explore the other area's of the museum but im sure that in time i will get another chance to revisit this stunning building.,What a let down
"February 20, 2023","When we arrived at the museum there was a strike on, we had travelled for over 2 hours  and we could not access the building. We had no communication from the museum warning us not to come and had two children aged 5 and 12 with us who were upset, we were told it was on the website, we had no reason to go on the website at 8am in the morning when we left. Extremely disappointed with the overall experience and out of pocket (train, petrol and parking).",Beautiful Museum
"October 25, 2022","The entry to the museum was well organized and easy to get in. Once you enter the building, you'll see how grand the Great Court is.  They have pieces from all around the world (North America, Africa, Europe, Asia, etc.) The museum is nicely laid out and you spend all day walking around...starting from the top floor or the bottom floor.",Luxury and power Persia to Greece exhibition
"August 7, 2023","Luxury and power Persia to Greece exhibition. This is well set out, as are all exhibitions at the British Museum. It was helpful that I had read some of Mary Renaults books about Alexander the great, Greece and Persia. The exhibition leads you through a chunk of history , well illustrated and documented by exhibits and maps and text. The exhibits are gorgeous. My main reason for the visit was to see the Thracian gold from Bulgaria. When I was at a museum in Bulgaria a few years ago unfortunately the gold was on loan abroad! The gold exhibits were fantastic with great detail surviving burial for a long time and show how carefully they were retrieved and cleaned",Whistle-stop Visit
"August 14, 2023","It is a great venue and we new we were short on time due to having booked other events in on the same day. However, once inside, we spoke to a member of staff who gave us a museum map which conveniently had a 'Don't Miss' section. This enable us to visit the main bits in our 2hr visit. This was great as we were short on time. To be honest, even spending the whole day here, you will barely scratch the surface. In truth, spending a week here, you would only see a fraction of what they have to offer. It is an amazing place to go and we have been multiple times before. ",Amazing Volunteer and Unusual History Made Understandable
"September 21, 2022","There was a museum volunteer doing hands on history.  We never got to touch something 2,000 years old and understand its history.  There were Roman era letters (in lower case Latin)  written on wood that were ordinary conversations that brought history to life.",Burma to Myanmar
"November 5, 2023",After managing the depressing long queue extending around the block entry was quite quick.  The Burma to Myanmar exhibits are well displayed with accompanying explanations.  They vary from clothes to buddhas and gold bowls.  However as it tries to encompass everything the exhibition appears shallow and disjointed.  If you have been to Myanmar you will enjoy it but otherwise you may feel that your knowledge is still superficial.  It took us 50 minutes to get round reading all the explanations.  Not very good vale at £18 /ticket including £2 donation.,Something for everyone
"June 22, 2022",This museum presents a wide variety of exhibits and has something for everyone. There was a large queue but went down quite quickly and the luggage checks were done well and fast. There are great gift shops with a large selection of items. There is also a cafe where you can have food and drinks.,Very nice british museum
"November 8, 2022","If you like museums, you will know that in one day you will not visit this museum. It is a very nourishing experience to be able to find objects with so much history in one place. It is free but you must book in advance. At the entrance there is a map that if you read it in detail you will find that there are routes to visit the most emblematic if your time is short. Also in the center of the building there is where to eat.I loved showing my daughter the history of the world in one place.",One the best place to visit in London
"April 7, 2023","The British Museum is a must-see for anyone visiting London. The stunning sculptures, knowledgeable staff and inspiring stories of the world-renowned exhibits make it a truly memorable experience. Whether you're looking to learn more about history or just take in the beauty of the museum, you won't be disappointed. Highly recommend!","A lot to see, but very tiring"
"August 27, 2022","The British Museum has an impressive collection of historical items, many of which are hundreds or thousands of years old. Obviously, the collection is immense, and there's a lot to see. There is a lot there. It makes sense to go in with a game plan on what you want to see, and where to find it. We used their map of the ""must see"" items and planned based on that. At first, we tried to see everything on the way to those items, but finally decided it made sense to stick with the big items and see other things as you are able.Because it's so long and tiring, a few suggestions. The air conditioning isn't very good, and this was when it was pleasant in the low 20's C. There also aren't a whole of benches or places to rest or take a longer look at things. Still a great experience which everyone should see, but we could have used a more comfortable situation.",Dazed
"February 10, 2023",During our recent visit we had to leave the museum much earlier than intended. Many large groups of very young school children were blocking exhibits and doorways and running around. In the end it became so noisy and difficult to navigate we gave up.,Just an extraordinary institution - must visit (and it's free!)
"July 30, 2022","So I've been visiting the British Museum with my kids since they were tiny - now they are in their mid 20's they still want to meet me there. I visited yesterday (travelling from Yorkshire) and met my son. We spent 2 hours in Ancient Greece, had one of the best cream teas in London in the Great Court Restaurant and then spent an hour in the Japan Rooms and then a short visit to Anglo Saxon Europe. The staff are wonderfully helpful, the amenities clean and plentiful, the building itself is just sublime. It is one of the best museums in the world.",Mementos of history
"November 20, 2022","After we told our cab driver our destination, he replied, ""Oh, the place where we keep all the things we stole from other countries.""  Yep, that pretty much sums it up. There are, of course, bits from the UK too. The museum is best enjoyed if you focus on a specific interest. The courtyard featured in the description photo is lofty and (on the day when we visited) sunny. The cafes and gifts shops are worth a visit. ",Fantastic
"October 10, 2020","I've been a regular visitor to the British Museum for years and am reviewing my post lockdown visit.It's less crowded though the queues to the loos are long.  You follow a one way route, and when I went it was just the ground floor.  It's still an amazing experience.  ",A Bit Disappointed
"July 19, 2023","I don't like to write negative reviews and prefer not to write anything at all, however, with the British Museum, I must say a few things. I love to go to museums and frequently visit the MET in New York City, the Getty and Getty Villa in California. I had such high hopes for the British Museum. It was difficult to navigate because it was extremely hot inside and it wasn't hot outside. There was no AC. You felt slight relief if you stood in front of the floor fans located in a few areas. Sweat was uncharacteristically rolling down my back the entire visit. There were so many people in attendance. I don't know if it's because the museum is free, but it definitely felt overcrowded. All we could do was rush from one area to the next, skipping many sections. I began to wonder if this was a plan of the museum so people would keep moving and not stay in one place for too long. The only true relief was in the lower level that housed the African exhibit. The AC was on high and felt like a freezer. It felt great! So, this leads me to believe they do have AC, but it was either not working that day, is fickle or they wanted you to keep moving. I wanted to love the museum, but after a little over an hour, my party of four was ready to leave, sadly unimpressed.",Too busy and smelly
"February 5, 2023","The museum is a victim of it's own success, and is unpleasantly crowded. Just crowds of people milling around.Also, thanks to the central atrium being turned over to cafes, the inner galleries reek of cooked food. Such a shame. I won't be back.",A Remarkable London Experience!
"August 28, 2023","Visiting the British Museum in London in July was an enriching experience. The diverse range of exhibits, from ancient artifacts to modern art, offered a captivating journey through history and culture. The museum's impressive architecture and well-organized displays made the visit enjoyable, although the higher summer crowds did affect the overall experience. Despite the crowds, the British Museum remains a must-visit destination for anyone interested in world history and art.",Visit London.com. missold tickets
"July 8, 2023",Just heard from the museum that the booking I made last night for afternoon tea will not be honoured due to planned industrial action. These dates should not be advertised as AVAILABLE when they are clearly not. I have contacted visit London.com for a full refund as they are at fault,A great day out
"February 20, 2022","This is a great place to visit either with family or friends, very well laid out, clean and tidy, plenty of staff on hand to give advice and help.  Fantastic exhibits that are well laid out and informative.  Very nice cafe area that has professional and friendly staff, nice clean toilets as well.  Plenty of interests for the children to help keep them amused, there are various things going on around the museum such as talks etc.  The history and culture is not only breathtaking but mind blowing as when looking at the age of the artifact it's amazing how it has survived.  Very interesting to learn about stuff you may have wondered about or thought you knew about.  A great day out and must if you are visiting London.",Coffin's Museum
"March 12, 2022",British Museum make us think if all those masterpieces of art were saved from being distroyed în there original location or they have been just stollen from the places were they belong. British Museum îs also a strange Coffin Museum. A collection of coffins from different civilisation. A museum illustrative for our fear to death. A lot of energy used for nothing. Just coffins.,Rooms closed and museum focuses on paid exhibitions 
"July 6, 2021","The Elgin Marbles not available to visit as the room is closed. Able to have rooms fully staffed for exhibitions where this is a charge such as Nero and Becket. Other rooms are also ""closed for maintenance"" but no work is being done! ",Interesting and Diverse
"September 3, 2023","This is a very impressive museum. I reserved a ticket ahead of time with a certain entrance window, but no one checked that when arrived. Definitely download the app ahead of time - it was helpful and had a cool feature where you can pay for different guided tours. I did the ""top 10"" one and it wasn't too expensive, but it was good to have direction moving through the museum. It was really crowded when I went, but I guess that's to be expected during the summer.",Nero ... not at all bad!
"September 28, 2021","Visited the Nero exhibition which was interesting, informative and well displayed.A rush around part of the rest of the British Museum made me wonder why there was no British history in the British Museum.  The Victorian British removed vast amounts of statues from Greece, and Rome .. but there was so much from Egypt one wonders if anything is left there.A great building. Masses of exhibits.  Did the British ""borrow""too much, perhaps?",A must visit
"April 14, 2022","The building itself is worth the visit but once you’ve picked your jaw up off the floor at the glass roof/ceiling you get to explore the different exhibitions. Artefacts from Ancient Greece, Egypt, Japan to name but a few. I especially liked the clocks exhibit.",Skip the Stolen Goods
"June 8, 2023","Okay this may be controversial but it was crowded, few places to sit and enjoy the art/exhibits, and I was mostly uncomfortable and sad by the amount of exhibits that have been requested to be returned to their homelands. Maybe I’m just American but seems like things should be given not taken! Wish I could get my £2 back for the map",Full of wonder!
"April 3, 2023","The British Museum is truly amazing.The history and art collected in these halls is beyond imagination.The building itself is grand and airy, architecture breathtakingly beautiful, entrance is free( donation suggested).If you only have 1-2 hours, make a plan in advance which must sees you plan to visit.Otherwise you could easily spend a day inside.Rosetta Stone, Lewis chessmen, Rothschild collection, Ramses and ancient Egypt, walks of Persepolis, and halls and halls of amazing treasures from all over the world.Needless to say, there are gift shops and cafes and there are free themed tours you should avail yourself of if you have time.Museum is good for children as well and there are lots of places to sit down and rest.The maps are very helpful as the Museum is huge.We will be coming back.",Disorganised and disappointed grandson
"September 2, 2023","Disorganised and disappointed grandsonMy husband and I took our 8 yr old grandson to the BM on 1st September.  I checked the website yo see if there were any issues in planning our visit. On arrival we made s beeline for the Grove centre on lowe ground floor (-1).  We a d another couple took the lift only to exit and find access cordoned off without explanation. We went back up and were told to take a different lift. On arrival at the Grove reception we asked anout the backpacks and trails and were told they could only gve us a token for a locker and we could have our packed lunch there. They told us to go back up to the main floor and enquire there. Back up we went and saw a desk entitled 'Family visits'. No one was there. We checked our watches and it was not yet 12.30 when the desk was due to close for lunch.  We were growing increasingly frustrated. We headed to the main information desk and were informed there was no one ag tge Family visits desk. This was odd as it was the ladt day of the school summer holidays. I asked if they could give us the trails maps and backpack but was told they could not access thst desk as they were different staff. I asked if they could not just pop across and give us what we needed and we were told they could not. 'Jobsworth' came to mind. He had however one of thd Egyptian trails leaflets we could have. Which was better than nothing but I asked about the Ancient Greek trails  as this was the main purpose of our visit. He said not only did he have nothing else on his desk (it was all at the Family desk across from him - bereft of staff and seemingly inaccessible). Then  the icing on the cake.. many of the Ancient Greek rooms were closed due to staff absences because of the rail strike.  Our grandson could really not understand and neither could we the extent of the lack of information provided.  With one Egyptian trail in hand, no backpack we made the best of our visit which was ultimately enjoyable but could hsve been so much more so.",So much to see
"September 4, 2021",Four of us queued up before 10am on a Sunday hoping we’d get in as we didn’t have tickets. The queue was quite long but it moved really quickly from 10am and we got in no problem. We were quite surprised to see many rooms roped off. That said we still really enjoyed our visit.,Magnificent visitor experience
"July 4, 2023","What an amazing place! From the moment you enter, you are taken aback by the pure majesty by the building itself. Inside you are treated to a plethora or exhibits to feast your eyes upon, so allow yourself a good few hours to take it all in.I personally enjoyed the Greek & Roman section prior to entering the Egyptian section, which was breathtaking.  There is so much to see & enjoy, do I’d recommend getting in early.Highly recommended for any visitor to London.",Too many people.  What is the point of a timed ticket?
"November 15, 2022","Returned after a few years. Booked an unnecessary timed ticket online and rushed to get there only to find 3 queues, members only, timed tickets and essentially one for no tickets (which was the longest). Joined the timed ticket queue,  it passed through a security tent, but so did the other 2 queues where we were all mixed up. Didn’t get asked to show our tickets. Inside it was bedlam.  Too many people,  too many school parties.  Had an expensive coffee, far cheaper outside. Toilets were downstairs with a queue. Didn’t get to see all we wanted as one needs a map, print from website as it costs £3 here, and too many people in each room. Egyptian and Greek  exhibits were good to see. Totally amazed how many were let in. It was only a Monday morning.  Bonus was it was free, staff helpful and there were some lifts.  Crowds ruined it for us.",Definitely worth a visit
"April 26, 2023","There is so much to see in this wonderful museum you would need several days to see everything. However if you only have a couple of hours there a few highlights that are listed in the museum map. We particularly enjoyed seeing the Sutton Hoo artefacts, the Elgin Marbles and the Ancient Egyptian pieces. Definitely worth a visit.",Plan ahead and spend some time.
"May 31, 2022","You could wander for days in this place.  Glad I limited my entry time, or I would never of seen London.  They have artifacts from almost all eras of man, specializing in the lands of England around the world.  What a collection and very helpful staff.  I went specifically to learn about pre-unification of the United Kingdom, and found it, plus a whole lot more.  Most fascinating to put movie storylines together with real exhibits.",Plan to spend the day
"April 9, 2022","Plan to spend 3 hours or more unless you have a particular interest.  Also suggest reserving your entry - I skipped line with my reservation.  Some of the Assyrian sections were closed when I was there, but most of the museum was open.  Pace yourself - look a bit, rest a bit and cogitate, use the free floor plan map and work your way around.  I spent 4 hours...(!)","Busy, Interesting, and there's a great book shop!"
"March 1, 2023","This museum is hugely popular with tourists and locals alike. We thought it would be quieter during a February on a weekday. However, we visited on the same day as many schools! Or perhaps this is normal! It was so busy and the museum is HUGE. As a Brit who doesn't live far away, I would visit again section by section. This time I was mainly interested in the Egyptian artefacts, having recently returned from Egypt. Next time, I'll visit to focus on the other sections. The book shop is amazing. They have some great books for kids and adults.",Interesting but...
"October 19, 2020","Nice place, but the COVID 1-way routing was welcomed but got annoying.  We were able to eat lunch in the cafe.  I'm not sure how much of the museum was not open but I'm glad we didn't bring the kids.The free audio is a joke, it's just incomplete clips.  If they aren't going to offer audio headsets then at least provide a way to purchase the guide using your phone.",Huge
"July 14, 2022",This is a large museum showing historical artefacts from around the world. Most of the items are of world importance and many are controversial because of the way they were obtained like the Parthenon Marbles and the Benin Bronzes. If you are a tourist in London this is a must visit place. It is as good as any museum in the world and it is free.,"Simple Amazing artifacts, but I could have used a bottle of water."
"August 27, 2022","Pros: The museum has over 8 million pieces in its collection and I swear we didn't see even a fraction of it. They had so many different exhibits & it was great to see so many things.  The museum was free & their gift shop is huge!Cons: We were there for 3 hours, it was so busy & hot. The upstairs Cafe only serves afternoon tea, which was fantastic, especially when all the other refreshment counters were closed. ",Great day out for the whole family.
"November 5, 2022","A great day it for the family with lots to see and read and view. We went and saw the Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Asian and south Asian history and artefacts used in those times.  Kids absolutely loved all the displays and reading up on all the history of each thing they saw there.  We stayed for nearly 4Hours and even that we didn’t get to see the whole museum as it’s so big. Def have to make a trip back to see the rest of what we missed. A great day out and free too. Only asking for a donation as you wish to pay.",Breath Taking Architecture
"October 12, 2020","An absolutely amazing place to visit, the architecture inside and out is nothing short of breath taking, literally as soon as you walk in.I had a friend visit from Australia, so I did the normal haunts around London but this was the cherry on the cake, we walked round for nearly 4 hours taking in all the sights.All the staff are super friendly and very knowledgeable which makes your visit so much nicer.",Beautiful Museum
"June 6, 2023",Went with some friends in London and really enjoyed our day at the museum. It is large and didn't feel crowded even though the long security line outside says differently. Entrance is free but with a suggested donation. The exhibits are well displayed and labeled,The Marvelous British Museum
"August 31, 2023","The British Museum can be described in a nutshell: stratospherically beautiful. Even as you stand in line outside, you can sense the beauty of the museum inside as well. As soon as you enter you are completely lost to admire it all.Huge collection, I highly recommend a visit.",Don't miss the Korea Room!
"January 26, 2022","We have visited the British Museum several times. During the most recent visit, we found the Korean Room.  I like Korean pottery very much and did not know this museum had a Korean area.  It isn't easy to find.  The map show it as an island detached from the rest of the space.  It is worth searching out.  Extraordinary display of Korean art & ceramic ware, both ancient and modern. We enjoyed the rest of the museum, of course, ancient Greece, ancient Britain but Korea was a revelatory experience!",Fantastic Collection of British Plunder
"January 10, 2022","A fantastic day out for anyone remotely interested in fascinating artefacts we British have plundered over the years 🙂, Gladiators Helmets & Weapons Asian Masks, Egyptian Statues .. the list is endless. The central atrium is also an architectural masterpiece.",Great to see but……
"July 13, 2023","Fantastic museum to visit and explore, very good content to see that is also interactive in areas to keep the young kids engaged.But the over crowding takes away from the experience, they should reduce the amount of people that can go through the doors at once.Still very good to see and would recommend going, just be prepared for the chaos.",Empowering experience
"June 14, 2022","I recently visited the ‘Feminine Power: the divine to the demonic’ exhibition - it was exceptional! I visited with my adult daughter and her friend and we were all completely blown away by it.  The combination of text explaining each item, the written reactions of the public, along with the comments of the exhibitions female collaborators was absolutely spot on. There was a claim at the entrance that said I would be changed by what I saw - and they were right. Can’t recommend this highly enough.",for the Rosetta Stone

Quite disappointed.  no problem spending 4 hours discovering the treasures the museum has to offer.",Impressive
"May 2, 2022",The Stonehenge exhibition rightly deserves the acclaim. Deeply atmospheric you are immersed in the history and anthropology of ancient Britain. Understanding the value to the community including not only as a burial site but of it’s importance in Europe was enlightening. The thought that’s gone into the sounds of the sea and air as well as the light animations is impressive. If you can go you won’t regret it.,Troy exhibition
"February 28, 2020","Disappointed. We are too familiar with the story and films of it. The display was no more than one beautiful pot design, repeated many times, also used in advertising, so already seen. Really it is a traditional museum display with lots of labels to read. It needs a few video clips or a small cinema area to bring this epic story to life. Even a short guided tour would be fine",Hasn't lost its charm
"January 21, 2020","It is huge and there are lots and lots of stuff to see. No chance of taking it all in during one visit, so you either have to select what you want to focus on or plan to come back more than once. Though it is big it can get crowded in places.",so cool

"January 27, 2020","Our visit to London was short , and there is a lot to do.  We almost didn't come to the British Museum because its so big and we thought we wouldn't have time.  But thankfully we got a few tips.  First, use the backdoor. Yes there is a backdoor and the line was 10 people.  The front door was easily 200.  Second, The guide/map gives you a cheat sheet of where to find the top 20 or so items .  The idea is if you only have an hour or so you can find the most popular exhibits like the Easter Island head and the Rosetta stone.   It was great for us because we got to see the ""big ticket"" items with our limited time.    I would recommend allowing yourself more time.  I know we missed a lot, but it was a nice to have for us on this trip.",Block off your day for this incredible museum
"September 23, 2023","A definite must-see when visiting London! It was almost overwhelming how much history was in this museum. So many amazing exhibits. My favorite was Ancient Egypt. I've never seen so many mummies up close. It did get pretty crowded so be prepared for that. We spent hours exploring the museum on our own and it still wasn't enough time. I recommend blocking off your entire day, especially if you like to read everything like we do. A guided tour would have been great as well since there was so much to see. ",Unmissable experience - go and see the Rosetta Stone
"May 18, 2022",What a great experience. Free entry to the museum. Impossible to see everything in one go - I found it interesting but at the same time tiring. It's a wonderful place for those who can go there often and admire the collections.,The impressive architecture

Whether you're a history buff or just looking for a fun afternoon out, the British Museum is sure to provide an enjoyable experience.

The museum is a great place to spend a few hours and learn something new. Highly recommended!",British museum is a must see
"October 1, 2023",Allow enough time! We went with the London Walks tour and felt we didn’t have enough time at the museum to just browse so I would say see the museum first and then have a tour if time. The Egyptian stuff is reason alone to go! So much more… the area around the museum is nice too for strolling so be sure to walk around a few blocks. ,The British Museum.  It is worth multiple visits
"March 26, 2023","Outstandiong collection of artifacts.  The central part of the building is beautiful.  From here you can pause and plan your visit.  If you are in London for an extended period I suggest multiple short visits.  The place is so huge and there is so much to see you can get Museum Overload.The Museum is free.  It also gets mobbed so I suggest getting there early (it opens at 10am).  Make it the first stop on your day.There are numerous must sees including but not limited to the Rosetta Stone.  Great exhibit of money, Egyptian Mummies, etc. etc. etc. ",A Must-See for Art Historians
"September 21, 2022","There's so much to see in the British Museum, it may be difficult to do justice to it with just one visit. It has an unbelievable collection of art and artifacts from all different cultures, representing thousands of years. It's simply an amazing place.",Hot and Crowded
"July 3, 2023","Please be advised that if you are heat-intolerant, this isn't the place for you in the summer! We went mid-June when it was about 80F outside. We walked in and the atrium was very warm. I thought it may be due to all the windows making it like a greenhouse. Well, we went into one of the exhibit wings and it was even hotter in there! Warm, stagnant air, packed with people. No air flow. There was one dinky stand fan and the museum worker was sitting on a bench with the fan pointed at her face. Lol. There's no way to concentrate and read/look at everything  when you've got sweat rolling down your back. We walked out and it was much cooler outside. So, that visit was a big waste of time. We did go previously in Dec 2021 and enjoyed it. There is a lot to see and read which is why we went back this time - to see what we may have missed.",Brilliant
"January 13, 2022",So this was one of first places we visited in London. We were extremely excited to see the Egyptians. The mummy collection is unreal. The museum is massive. There was a few things closed off when we were there but hopefully when I’m back it will be open again. Yet again the staff are very friendly and are extremely helpful. It’s also free to get into if your looking for something to do and you don’t want to spend a lot of money. ,Highlights for a family with a 8year old child
"January 3, 2023","We had 2 days, one for the free exhibitions and one for the hieroglyphs exhibition. For the first day we had a time reservation but it really did not matter. Access was easy with reasonable waiting times. We enjoyed the Parthenon sculptures, the Assyrian artefacts and, of course, the Egyptian ones. Roman Britain was also interesting.",LOVED this museum
"January 4, 2020","Go here - plan for 3-4 hours. FASCINATING museum, even our teens loved it!

It's all so fascinating!",Free Trip Through Time
"August 6, 2022","The British Museum has a large inventory of historical items that go back to the Egyptian era.  The actual Rosetta Stone is there!  And it's free.  If you don't spend at least an hour there, you're not trying.  It's a 2-4 hour event.  And it's free.  Be ready to stand in line and have your bags searched.  ",Magnificent
"September 3, 2022","There is a vast collection of relics and artefacts from all around the world which also draws visitors from over the world as there is something each of us can relate to. The building is huge and beautiful with so much information to learn from. Unfortunately there is not enough time to just spend one day at the museum. I would suggest looking at what they have available and which room they are contained in, then plan your day accordingly otherwiseYou will be exhausted at the end",so much history!
"August 6, 2021",Incredible building with so much history in we were very overwhelmed.  We were booked for 2pm and the queue was next to nothing.  Bag check on the way in and then all done.  We purchased a guide book and map (there is a smaller version of the map in the guide book) and set to.Our only gripe was we hadn't seen the planned closure of the area which we were most looking forward to.  This is the main reason our visit was shorter than we expected.Would definitely recommend this as a great way to learn about human history and we will 100% be back when the Greece/Rome rooms reopen.,Extensive free to enter museum
"March 9, 2023","Visited here on a recent trip to London, as hadn't been there since I was a kid! Plenty of rooms, off rooms, off other rooms (!!) all full of artefacts and collections from different parts of the world, other cultures and times, so plenty to delight the ardent museum goer. Good free talks on variety of subjects throughout the day, although both the ones we'd have liked weren't running on the day we visited. We also found that some of the exhibitions we'd have liked to visit were closed 'for refurbishment' (or some such?) so we missed out on those. Nice that they have now infilled the main courtyard in the centre (Millennium project, I think?) so all indoors now. You could spend a week going round here and still not see all you wanted to see, especially as the rooms 'map' in the booklet is quite difficult to follow, we found. A half day was about right for us - after that we were 'museumed out'!!",Exciting Museum for History Buffs!
"February 21, 2020","I've wanted to go to The British Museum since I was a child, and I was not disappointed. Their collection of Egyptian artifacts is amazing, and we enjoyed the Byzantine collection, as well. But perhaps most exciting was the special exhibition on Troy. OMG, I am a lifelong fan of mythology, and this exhibit traced the history and story of the Trojan War. I think it would be an archaeologist and historian's dream to assemble an exhibit like this ... taking physical evidence of the people and times, and interweaving it with mythology. It was terrific.",Worth a visit
"May 7, 2023","An amazing museum.  It is extremely large, and in it you can find various objects of inestimable value.  It took us 3 hours to go through it, but we just flew over some parts.  It would take 2 days for a detailed review.  The most interesting parts are the Rosette, mummies, Aztec and Babylonian ornaments, Greek statues, samurai clothing, etc. In my opinion, there are too many different vessels from Greece and Egypt and wall inscriptions from Mesopotamia.  It is valuable, but it is of interest only to historians.  It is good to make an entrance reservation from home, because that way you can skip the queue.",A must see London museum
"August 30, 2022","With so much to see, it's difficult to know where to start.  Even with a plan and a map, it can be difficult to find you way around.  The Great Court  is a wonderful piece of architecture.  I'm not normally a fan of Foster and Partners work, but in this instance it's worthy of mention and has created a useable, covered space.   It does get busy busy on rainy days in London. The museum is one of London's must see museums, but don't forget there are others.  Maybe not as big or with the same kudos, but they are worth a visit","The Spiritual Predecessor to OJ's ""If I Did It"""
"May 8, 2022","This is an unapolagetic shrine to the horrors of British Imperialism. Its callous disregard for any sort of human decency is frankly appalling.

"April 14, 2022","Well, definitely museum has a lot of to see, therefore I come here every time I visit London. However, main different between this time and 10 years ago is that, looks like BM need to invest more to work on manners and custumer service of their security guards, especially in the morning and in front entrance. Not that people wait in huge line and hours before they can enter, but being treated very rude manners and as cattle in stock by security guards. Totally not acceptable for cultural institution.",Family visit 
"September 13, 2020",Thought it would be a good time to visit as they limit the amount of people going in. It wasn’t really busy but plenty of people in there.

I asked the “helper” if I needed to queue considering we had booked a slot and he very rudely told me to get in line. That was it.

You need to give yourself closer to 4 hours - just to scratch the surface!I took the Enlightenment tour w/Jan. She was wonderful, insightful & witty.Next time I find myself in London (I will be back), I will pay for the self guided audio tour as well",Excellent 
"July 27, 2023","I was amused that as soon as I entered a young lady asked me for a donation. The amusement was due to the fact that after being reduced to utter penury on being colonised for over a century, we now need to donate to take care of what was once ours. A fantastic museum. Must see. ",British Museum's Burma to Myanmar exhibition on now - don't miss it!
"November 26, 2023","I have just been to the absolutely magnificent Burma to Myanmar Exhibition at the British Museum. My goodness, what a fascinating collection of pieces on display! The incredible history and diversity of this complex country is brilliantly told. Some of the pieces are mind-blowingly intricate and others are so moving. One of the BM's best!",Amazed!
"August 6, 2022",Another wonderful museum in London! The queue was long but moved fast. Astonishing collection and artifacts. Egypt Mummy was interesting section. It's a huge museum be there early. They have about 8 million artifacts all around the world so that what I loved to see everything under 1 roof. The library is interesting and insightful !Bravo to the Curators.,Cultural
"February 18, 2022",Lovely to be back post-pandemic. Opens late on Friday.  I went to watch the free Celebrating Peru – ORIGINS Festival which was a lovely cultural experience.  Well organised and busy despite the storm. Staff were pleasant and friendly.  Great museum but so much to see.  One trip is not enough.  Free entrance but some of the events and exhibitions have a fee.,Great Beckett exhibition but lack of social distancing.
"May 23, 2021","We came to visit the Thomas Beckett exhibition. His story, the story of his brutal murder and the reverence after his death was well told and extremely interesting with manuscripts and decorative objects that were nearly 1000 years old. The only problem was the complete lack of social distancing within the exhibition space.",Wrong Museum
"October 29, 2023",Strangely nothing in the British museum is British and it feels like they have been taken from their rightful places from museums all around the world. Strangely many of those countries were the plundered British colonies. The only thing British there is the queue to get in.,As stunning as I'd been told
"March 16, 2023","The array of artifacts is spectacular - mostly from Ancient Greece, Rome, Mesopotamia, and Egypt.  Highlights for us included Rosetta Stone, Egyptian mummies, and Japan exhibit! We had tickets, but turned out they were letting anyone in.  I would try and get some ahead of time just in case",Fascinating place and friendly staff
"June 11, 2021","The museum was excellent, really fascinating pieces of  history. The staff were also helpful and friendly, the security people on the door were really helpful and very generously let us in even though we messed up our booking.   Thank you!",All the stuff we’ve nicked
"July 8, 2022","There is no doubt that this is an amazing collection in a wonderful space. I am not one of these anti colonial Scots but the more I walked around here the more I felt uncomfortable wondering how folk got their hands in these items. The Greek Parthenon section was the worst.Building itself is stunning, fantastic that it’s free, pretty boring for kids I would think.One tip is not to queue at the main entrance which was very busy but to walk around to the other side and queue was less than 5 minutes",For anyone interested in history and culture
"December 8, 2023","Its vast collection of artifacts, beautiful paintings, interactive exhibits, and captivating displays make it a truly unique experience. From the Rosetta Stone to the Parthenon sculptures, the museum offers something for everyone. The interactive exhibits allow visitors to explore the history and culture of the world, while the captivating displays provide an unforgettable experience.",Excellent Museum
"August 14, 2022","There is a lot to see here, so set aside at least 4 hours, or research what you want to see and go only to those rooms. This place can be overwhelming, and during summer some rooms get very hot and uncomfortable. Some rooms are not open due to high heat. Get there early to avoid large crowds including guided tours. This is a popular tourist destination and it fills up quickly. The food is good and fairly priced, and toilets are plenty. The staff is friendly and helpful. Highly recommend it.",Tour of British Museum with Dani the Guide
"June 13, 2020","We were 2 couples visiting London and had Dani the Guide show us around the British Museum.  Dani (Danielle)  was excellent.  We found her friendly, warm and very knowledgeable.  We have even kept in touch since the trip - Dani has sent us videos of other sites to see in London in the future.  Dani was so good that we have booked her for our next trip to London.  The British museum was outstanding and seeing it with Dani made it even more outstanding.",Incredibly well curated museum
"June 6, 2020","I arrived pretty early in the morning and the line wasn't too long (you do have to basically go through airport security though so that's what causes a long line). The map was easy enough to read and I saw a lot of the big highlights without too much hassle. There's a lot of history there and I would definitely set aside at least 3 hours or so to try to see it all.P.S. Remember that it's free. They'll ask for donations, but it's free and you should take advantage of that.","Unrivalled Collections, horribly overcrowded "
"January 6, 2020","I visit the BM about once a year. There is always something new to discover, this time it was the Japanese collection. The ceramics both old and modern are stunning. Unfortunately, each time I visit the crowds get bigger. It can be quite unpleasant at times, you need fortitude to stay the course. It's on the tourist trail and, of course, it is free. Should it charge? It does for special exhibitions. It's certainly something worth discussing if the visitor growth continues at the same rate.",A must see
"June 22, 2022",The British Museum is a must do if you have a few days in London. An exceptional collection of artefacts and exhibits that span human history. You could spend multiple days and still not see everything. Go through the Montague Street entrance as there will be a significantly smaller line to get in. You can still walk around to the front to see the covered courtyard space. Have an afternoon tea and recharge for the remaining time. Some exhibits open at staggered times for crowd and staff allowances. Ask the information desk about times. Take your time. Enjoy. It is worth the visit.,ENTIRELY BRILLIANT 
"September 24, 2023","It doesn't get much better than this. If, like me you take your time when visiting museums/tour places, then you can spend a day in here, easy. It is one of the 'prides of Britain' & a must if you visit London. Wonderful.",A great experience
"August 27, 2020","Its Open! Lovely to visit without the usual crowds and able to wander through the collections . It meant I could see everything properly, take photos without people in them and generally have a great experience. Of course I want the restrictions of the pandemic over with but I'd prefer the BM to stay as it is!",Wow so much to see!
"March 6, 2020",What an incredible day. Don’t skip the highlights tour. A great way to get an overview of so many offerings. Jean was so kind and informative. O what I went to see and what I loved are two different things. The Rosetta Stone is awe inspiring. But don’t skip the Sutton Hoo relics and reproductions. The Parthenon exhibit is a time machine taking the viewer back in time.   So many details and so little time. ,Impressive
"February 23, 2023","The virtual tour is quite impressive, the guide introduces a lot of exhibits to us. The displays inside the museum are all amazing, but sadly the tour is a bit short. The tour didn't show any exhibits belonging to Britain, which is a pity for people worldwide. Only watching items from non-Britain countries and even their own countries is a tragedy. We are looking forward to visiting the heritage belonging to British next time.","Check it out, it's free, you'll be amazed"
"November 3, 2023","It's free so go and have a look.  You will be amazed at all the artefacts they have Ancient Egyptian, Ancient Rome and Greece, Asia, Middle East, Americas.   The actual Rosetta Stone.  Just checkout the website it's all there you could spend a good few hours in here.  Plenty of places to eat and get a drink.  Absolutely amazing.",Amazing historical artifacts
"February 9, 2023",So much to see! You could spend an entire day here and not see even half of the collections. We went in the late afternoon so our time was limited but the lines were short so the wait time to get in was low. We had a 13 year old boy with us and even he was interested in the artifacts. There is a lot of walking so be prepared for that.,It was okay
"November 18, 2021","Our overall experience was good but, seen as though the only time the staff interacted with anyone was to tell them off. They didn’t know anything about the exhibits or where they are to help you look for certain things. They was only interested in talking to each other and barking at the visitors",British design at its best!
"June 21, 2020",Worth a visit if not just to enjoy the masterful interior design! I am a graphic designer and go just to get inspiration. Not too crowded (Especially these days) and the cafe inside the museum is top notch. Worth a check!,TROY VISIT
"February 24, 2020","I went with my daughter and her daughter to the Troy exhibition last month. We thoroughly enjoyed it, though it could have been better signposted, particularly to make it easier to follow a logical progression. Unlike Sheelagh, as a wheelchair user I found the low setting of the information very handy, as it would also be for younger children!The BM's provision of a wheelchair was much appreciated - without it I could not have visited! - and also that my daughter gained free entry as my carer!It is many decades since I was last at the BM - long before the work on the Central Reading Room. What a superb job the designers did all those years ago! We were able to negotiate the lift up to the café, and would give that 5 stars, not only for the afternoon tea but also for the view!I hope to go again very soon, though not during school holidays, if I can persuade some else other than my daughter to be my carer for the day!",Lovely Museum but packed
"June 29, 2023","Number One suggestion: If you have a 10 am reservation, don't arrive until at least 10:30. The line was wrapped around the block! We went to Starbucks across the street and waited it out.  Bags were searched but oddly enough, no one really looked at or scanned our phone tickets.  Beautiful museum but the end of our trip and I was exhausted and couldn’t walk much.  Hubby viewed some highlights and liked it but everything is spread out into little areas. Lots of walking.  Luckily the atrium is full of benches to take breaks. Thankfully the tickets were free, as we wouldn’t have gotten much value if we paid something.  ",Very busy and not customer friendly
"September 2, 2023","The Museum was packed. Not keen to take my bag in the cloakroom although it was only ten past four and they closed at 5pm. The members' cafe was very nice and quiet for a tea and cake and a big contrast to the hustle and bustle of the museum. Friendly Service. You can only get in there as a member or a guest of a member. The China exhibition seemed a bit lacking in artefacts, it was mostly costumes.",Nice experience 
"February 6, 2020","The British Museum is a very well organized museum, very interesting stories, and a helpful staff. Very big and clean, everything you need as a first visit is available. Good to go with friends and family. I think 1 hour is fare enough to enjoy it. ",Excellent Museum

There are benches in every room, so  you can sit down and rest. One negative - souvenir shop is really lacking of options! Only few type of souvenirs that are massively overpriced.",Take a Private Tour if You Can!
"January 25, 2022","This was my second visit to the British museum after a gap of 25 years.  My family booked a private tour for me and what a difference it made!  I truly enjoyed my first visit, but it did not compare to the tour I had with my own guide.  I got to see the must-sees on my list, with narrative by my retired classical archaeologist guide, and had the most interesting conversations about the collections.   ",Wonderful Experience
"October 19, 2020",The Egyptian displays are amazing we have visited Egypt many times and been lucky enough to see some of the wonderful sights.This is as good as it gets outside of the relics natural environment. Well worth a visit or two! The building is also amazing and easy to get to.,Free but so very crowded
"April 17, 2022","I had booked a morning time slot online and was rushing as I was a few minutes late. In the end, I went through the side entrance and no-one checked my ticket. The problem was that the museum was therefore packed. Why make people book when you don't enforce it. I enjoyed seeing the Egyptian and Assyrian areas and the Rosetta stone but it was overwhelmingly crowded which detracted from the experience.",A personal favourite!
"September 13, 2022","This is my favourite of all the museums in London bar one, the Imperial War Museum. The variety and content of the exhibits here are simply stunning. However, I firmly believe that we should return the ""Elgin Marbles"" to Greece and the Mummies to their final resting places at home in Egypt.",The British Museum
"January 23, 2021","Sadly the most famous object they have ""The Roseta Stone"" still doesn't interest me at all despite dozens of visits. Maybe I'm not cultured or sophisticated enough to know the value of it yet. I first went there years ago to see the mummies because to me that's more relatable humanly but over the years and after many many visits, I've learnt to appreciate the other smaller things they have at their disposal. Especially the objects the British explorers brought back from their newly discovered colonies. It also gives you an idea of the scale of British empire back when it was truly The Great Britain.I don't know how many times will I have to visit it to see the entire place as its just not possible in one go nor recommended.  I come back with hundreds of pictures and see, learn about something new after every visit. They have so much more stuff in storage than what's on the display. From giant Buddha to tiny little things that need microscope to examine. It's a treasure land for history lovers.",Fantastic day
"February 28, 2020","Visited in half term with my 8yr old daughter and my friend . We had amazing day . The cue was not long to get in . My friend has a disability and we were able to go everywhere we wanted visit . My daughter loved ancient Egypt and Roman history . Could be because she is or has been studying at school . She loved seeing all the mummies and Rosetta Stone . Very excited reading everything . We were there for over 4 hours . What am amazing place for children who love history to explore . We are going to Tutankhamen exhibition in April , but this will take a lot of topping . Well done",Overwhelmingly Wonderful
"October 25, 2022",Our tour guide Andy was amazing.  The British Museum is overwhelming. Andy was able to show us some of key exhibits with spellbinding knowledge and insight.   Having an expert give narration to the stories behind the artifacts really made them come alive. I highly recommend this tour! ,London Family trip
"January 4, 2020","Amazing, enormous and very rich. You will need a half-day to enjoy every spot in this great Museum. Most of the big eras in Human history is there. The location is very easy and close to the main attractions in London.",Wanted to visit it for years now
"November 18, 2023","Would deduct a point as Japan area was closed and I really wanted to see that 😞But, all in all it was a great place to visit and was surprised it was for free (still donated 5£ as it was totally worth it) and got few things from the giftshop. Vast exhibitions, very informative and I have always loved history and various cultures. If you have time for it, would recomend to vist. ",Too much walking and NOT for kids
"February 21, 2023",it was so very big and I hurt my feet walking round. I guess some of the objects where cool but it was just so big and it was confusing to walk around.my kiddos got bored instantly and there was basically nothing for them to do spent most of my time ( and money LOL) in the gift shop i guess there was cool stuff in the gift shop but thats about itdont even have the roseta stone anymoreTLDRdont take your kidsbring a chair re-morgage your home,A must in your list
"May 13, 2023","Stunning museum, my partner and me needed hours to see every item and admire every culture. History, science, architecture, sculpture, jewelry and so much more. You need more than only one day to see and admire every part of this wonderful museum, one of my favorites.",Set the tone for our London vacation
"March 8, 2023","Our first full day in London, began with the British museum, which was just an absolute delight! Stunning way to start a visit in London, beautiful beautiful museum reminded us of the Metropolitan Art Museum in New York, but deeper older history! We all loved it!",No Organization but Cool Stuff
"May 31, 2022",I did not understand the way that the exhibits we're organized. However once we found what we wanted to see it was neat. It was beyond crowded so I can't even believe what it's like on a weekend. Maybe if you get there when it first opens for the day you'll have a bit of peace?,Go later in day….  AM the q is enormous!
"December 8, 2022","Go later in the day. Our accommodation was stayed close by and noticed no q in the afternoon. When we originally wanted to go, at 10.30am the q is enormous!  Like a massive q a block away before even getting in q outside main entrance. Museum does stay open later on a Friday. Other days it shuts at 5pm. It’s been said before….  The building itself is a beauty and we loved Egyptian exhibit.",Amazing
"January 23, 2020",The British Museum is fabulous. Between the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles you can’t help but be impressed. So much to see and no admission fee. Just ask for a donation. You could spend hours here and only scratch the surface of things to see.,No Wonder This Us A Top Place To Visit In London
"February 14, 2022","Probably everything possible has already been written & reviewed about this amazing museum. Can’t believe I have never visited before. Spent about 3hours there, you could probably spend 3weeks & not see everything as there is so much to see. An incredible building full of so many artefacts.",British Museum Visit
"June 28, 2022","There is just so much to see here, you might want to visit on more than one day! No entry charge, but please leave a donation. Items and artefacts displayed from all,over the world and from all cultures. Highlights include The Sutton Hoo and the Rosetta Stone",A Foggy Day
"February 11, 2020","I think I saw more well preserved mummies in London than in Egypt. This is a fascinating museum to visit. But you must get there hours before it opens -- in order to assure yourself the self-audio tour. The details within the audio are worth the purchase. Every time I go to England, I must take a trip to British Museum. ",Go if you want it o do an activity indoors
"August 18, 2022",The building and architecture was splendid. But I was honestly expecting more grand items on display. Levels with exhibitions very tightly spaced Areas felt claustrophobic and lacking in air conditioning. We went on a very hot day.  Food very pricey but plenty of seats for resting throughout the levels.,Fascinating exhibitions
"April 14, 2022","There is always something new to see in the museum.  Prepare to spend most of the day there so you can cover all areas.  Fascinating exhibitions, and something for everyone.  Booked online easily for a time slot (museum is free).  Queue moved very quickly and we were in promptly.",Friday afternoon browsing
"February 25, 2023","Great way to while away a few hours on a rainy afternoon!  We had a great time learning new things and sharing our own knowledge.  Bad point was when we stopped for a cup of tea  -very expensive and when we went to try to sit down at the communal tables, it was extremely hard to find 2 stools together and the tables were strewn with used cups, plates and crumbs.  Tables could not have been wiped down for hours and there was no sign of anyone on the case.",Bucket list museum
"July 18, 2023","There is so much to see, you really need several days. This is to Britain what the Smithsonian is to the US. Amazing exhibits and stuff you read about in history books. The layout takes a bit to get used to and on the day we visited, it was very crowded.  Glad we went, but after seeing Westminster Abbey in the AM, we were pretty worn out at the end of the day and ready to get off our feet. It is very nice and if you are a museum buff, this should be on your bucket list. preparre to spend an entire day and see as much as you can.",Fascinating
"November 23, 2021","Had a lovely rainy day in London spent in the British museum, how fascinating all of the pieces are. Could definitely spend more than one day here. The coffee and cake from the cafe were lovely too. Overall a great day out.",Beautiful treasures but not covid safe
"February 4, 2022","Absolutely beautiful building with world class treasures. Didn’t stay long as covid measures had been dropped as we were among the minority of people wearing masks and socially distancing. No encouragement at all from the museum to wear masks, so we quickly left. Don’t got if you have underlying health conditions as you won’t be safe.",Go however expect refugee–camp sized crowds
"November 6, 2023",The volume of people was overwhelming.  ZERO crowd control.  So many people it was difficult to maneuver and some galleries were so packed people were shoulder to shoulder.  We were there about 11am and left around 12:30.  We managed to force our way to get close to the Rosetta Stone.  We saw some headless statues.  Bought some bottled water.  I don't know if there's a better time to go other than if you are a celebrity and you can arrange an after–hours visit.,Elgin's big marbles
"September 30, 2022","For years I used to think those big round balls in the foyer were Elgin's marbles. Although they were quite impressive to a seven year old, I just couldn't understand why Greece would be so bothered about having them back. Sort of just big concrete balls really. What about all the shiny stuff in there made out of gold? Years later, and with a much better understanding of post-colonialism, and I have to say this is still an amazing museum. Hated, adored, never ignored... that kinda thing. But yeah, maybe some stuff in there raises more questions than it should. Never mind the donations. Probably high time they addressed it. Well, it really is. But in the meantime I'd still pop in with my kids for a walkabout.",tea and tour
"October 26, 2022","A wonderful museum. We had afternoon tea there and it was one of the best in our month-long trip. We booked a day in advance and they prepared delicious vegetarian sandwiches for us. If we return to London, we'll have tea there again - it was amazing!",Great museum but disorganized and very crowded
"August 24, 2023","The time stamp on the ticket means nothing. No one checks the tickets. Huge line to get in at the front entrance. Did they sell so many tickets for the same time or did people figure out that no one checks the time? If you go around the building to the back entrance, no line there, you can walk right in. Inside was as crowded as the outside. People pushing each other, tons of tired crying children throwing fits. It was difficult to enjoy this beautiful museum in such atmosphere.",Not to be missed and go back for special exhibits
"January 18, 2020","This is one of the world's greatest museums, a must-see. I went back (probably 20+ visits in all) to see an interesting special exhibit on Homer. It was an unusual topic, dealing with literature, history and myth with a large range of very interesting items often scattered and some rarely on display.",Far too busy and crowded 
"August 23, 2023","Don't be fooled into getting a booking time to help the venue control numbers.... Booked and printed tickets, not checked once.Don't go to the 300 metres queue on Gt Russell St, go round to Montague Place and pretty much walk straight in.Far far too busy to enjoy the exhibits due to overcrowding. Extremely annoying getting pushed and shoved by someone simply wanting a photo. Took away most of the reason for the visit, to learn about stuff.Didn't actually see much in there that was actually British!!!A 20th Century Korean teahouse should probably be in a teahouse museum. Wouldn't be going back there in a long time",Must see in London
"December 14, 2022",I liked the museum but organization at entry could be better since it was very busy. We came to see Rosetta Stone and Hieroglyphics exhibition. Loved it. The museum is huge. Definitely need the entire day to see everything.,Ticketing a farse and too many people
"July 22, 2023",You are told you must book a time slot ticket. Yet when you get there there is another queue for those without a ticket and just merges. No one cares or checks your time slot.As a result when you get in the place is heaving. Can't see anything properly and hot with no fresh air.I propose that none UK tourists should pay:1. This may put a good number off and reduce the numbers.2. Plenty will still pay and bring the museum much needed income.The above should apply to ALL London museums.,Always a Treat
"July 3, 2023",Amazing place. On this visit we enjoyed the Money exhibit & the room dedicated to Clocks.  You could spend a month & barely scratch the surface. Note it is very crowded despite the massive scale. Interesting to see some acknowledgement that some of the amazing pieces on display were plundered & returns to their countries of origin are now being negotiated.,See all of the stolen goods
"January 29, 2020","From mummies to Greek statues, there's so much to see in this Museum. I went when they opened to beat the lines and went straight to the Rosetta stone and the Egypt section. The museum store is also very nice and I got some nice eco bags. Shame that these historical artifacts are in Britain and not their home countries.  ",Magical time travel
"March 20, 2022","A chronological tour through Northern European pre- history. The exhibits tell a poignant story, where everything aims at helping us understand the mindset of the hunger gatherers, early farmers, warriors and traders through the ages from before to beyond Stonehenge. If anyone goes with the idea of immersing themselves into the structure of Stonehenge, they'd be disappointed. However, if you are intending to understand the post ice age hunters, early farmers, warriors and traders with their belief system better, this is just magical. We felt in touch with the most elusive of worlds.",Just not our thing.
"June 30, 2023","We had a few hours to kill so thought we’d come here to see a slice of British history. Entirely my fault for not doing my research, but this museum houses artefacts from across the globe.As a consequence I found it all rather tiresome I’m afraid, not helped in the least by the fact it was stiflingly hot owing to many rooms not having air conditioning.Great if global history is your thing.

"November 21, 2022","Is a huge museum with lot of ancient history exhibits. Was amazed to see mummies so close. But my personal crush was Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. I only read about it when I was a child, as here it is, real statues from there.

We missed, but you might be lucky",Nice free museum
"January 9, 2023",For a big museum like this with so many exhibited items. It is hard to imagine that it is actually free. You can easily spend a few hours or even more because there’s a lot to see. Highly recommend it to people who would like some free leisure.,Great museum highly recommend it

"March 25, 2022","Brilliant Stonehenge exhibition. Interesting exhibits, well displayed and explained. Spent over 90 minutes in it, although some of that was unfortunately queuing to get to see things. Also enjoyed the Sutton Hoo finds and usually also visit the Lion Hunt but this was closed for some reason. Only downside is the appalling ground floor cafe, dreadful food and horrible seating - don’t go there.",A great place
"October 20, 2022","Great Place!  So much to see, not enough time to see everything.  Such rich history in this museum and not crowded together.  It would take at least a year to  walk through and see everything.  The best part is no entrance fees, only donations.",A must-see when in London
"September 17, 2023","The sheer wealth of objects and history of this place is simply mind-blowing. There’s so much to see: Egypt, Babylon, Persia, Australia..

I will certainly come back.",I came to see Alexander walker
"March 4, 2020","I being here many times, I got off at Holborn  station just follow the sign very easy.I wanted to see Alexander Walker collection it was a small room. Room number 90.Just a few of his Collection was on display. It was free.",Always worth a visit
"February 12, 2020",Every year we visit London and I always manage a visit. I am studying Egyptology and love seeing the exhibits fir Egypt and the Near East. There are still parts of the museum that I haven't seen yet.,Could Spend a Week
"January 3, 2020","Absolute must! We could easily spend a week in the museum, it’s huge. Allow at least 3 hours. Also recommend the cafe for lunch, expected it to very busy but got a table right away, reasonable priced good food.",Great Museum
"August 1, 2022",There is so much to see at this museum. You could visit many time and fail to see everything. I do think it could be improved by suggesting walking routs to make sure you see everything.,Soooooo much better than my last visit in 1970s
"January 8, 2020","Wow what a difference, this was a cluttered gloomy place last time I visited. The removal of all the organic building that had stuffed up the quad is amazing, what a lovely space. So much to see, a day is only enough scratch the surface.",Troy Exhibition 
"February 28, 2020","Visiting Troy exhibition . Very disappointed to find it over crowded, despite timed tickets. The signage is in small print at knee or ankle height. Unfortunately due to the design of the lighting, shadows are cast on the information boards further increasing the difficulty of reading the information boards. ",One of the World's Best Museums
"March 7, 2020","Yesterday a friend and I went to see  ""Troy""  Exhibition.   It must have taken years of planning to put together this great show.  I can't advise seeing it,  as it closes tomorrow.  BUT   there is so much to see in the other exhibition halls that  you could be there days.    Added addition,  it has many dining options.  Don't miss this museum!",Kind of disappointing 
"January 12, 2020","The guide to the rooms are not intuitive or easily seen. The staff was kindly helpful as we asked for specific numbers. Many of the special exhibits were not available, sad. Lots of Egyptians exhibits. The African section seemed to think West Africa represented all of Africa. Not as impressed as I expected to be. ",Amazing 
"March 6, 2020",This museum is one of the best I've ever been in. The ancient Greek exhibition is huge. I mean how did they manage to bring all that stuff in the UK. The ancient Egyptian exhibition is also quite big. Nice place to visit and don't forget it is free!!,"Unmissable, amazing museum "
"August 12, 2023","Undoubtedly one of the world's great museums.  Such an enormous amount of ancient artifacts in incredible condition.  Amazing to see art created more than 4000 years ago.  Of particular interest are the archaeological finds that back up large sections of the Old Testament of the Bible.  Amazing to see items from Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia and Greece that so fully back up what is written in the Bible.  Free entry, but be prepared to queue and for large crowds!",Masterpiece
"September 19, 2020","One of the best museum I ever seen before : lots of masterpieces, a very nice building and a very nice organisation inside. You cannot don't go there if you travel in London. Only a fool can avoided the British Museum. If you like history please don't miss the Rosetta Stone. It's a big pebble with some writing in different languages. Definitely a masterpiece too. Have fun !",Fabulous!
"February 20, 2022","Booked tickets in advance for the exhibitions I wanted to see-Peru and Stonehenge. The Stonehenge visit was excellent, full of interesting information and fascinating artefacts. Spent an hour and a half here. I also visited the Peru exhibition. Very good but not nearly as extensive as I had expected for a paid exhibition. Also visited the excellent Japanese exhibition and the Coffee Culture of the Islamic World. Two days well spent at my favourite museum.",Amazing
"August 13, 2022","It's hard to pin point one area that I loved more than the rest. I do love 1485+ years of British history, so I enjoyed the gold coins.I've been before, but there's always so much to see, you can never see it all in one day.",Beautifully presented collections - wheelchair accessible 
"September 15, 2022","Amazing collections with well written descriptions. Wheelchair access was good for the most part, some additional assistance was needed. A very busy location which can make it difficult to navigate in a wheelchair. I think additional seating would be beneficial. ",Great for the whole family
"March 25, 2022","A wonderful afternoon at an historic institution.  My kids liked the mummies, of course, but also enjoyed the Roman and British artifacts.  We spent a lot of time in the Mesopotamia area as well.  The personal library in cuneiform combining about doing homework or getting a baby to sleep was priceless.  The courtyard cafes were also great for a break with the littles between exhibits.",Great day out
"November 1, 2021","Absolutely brilliant, still as good as when I was younger, now I get to enjoy how great it is with my child. So fantastic to be able to go to London again and we have the best museums. Staff are really helpful and friendly, very clean and safe environment. Everything was perfect, great day out.",NERO EXHIBITION
"August 13, 2021",This is one of the best exhibitions we've been to at the BM with a range of well-explained and presented artifacts providing an alternative look at one of Rome's most well-known emperors. Informative and laid out so that it was accessible to those in wheelchairs. An excellent couple of hour's worth!,A fabulous museum in the heart of London
"June 5, 2022","One of the best museums I’ve ever seen.  Very impressive collection of Greek, Roman and Egyptian artifacts. It also is home to the Rosetta Stone-which I found to be absolutely incredible. So much to see and the museum is free to enter. ","Great exhibits, tea service is ok"
"May 16, 2022","We went there for afternoon tea and then saw a few of the exhibits. It is free. Tea was tasty, service was ok. Our waitress spilled Prosecco all over me and my husband. Accidents happen, but it was uncomfortable. The location for tea was noisy. Would not go for tea there again even though the food was nice, would have preferred a more Intimate setting.",Great exhibition
"June 16, 2022",We went specifically to see the Stonehenge exhibition which was very good with some fantastic artefacts. Far more emphasis on the people and contemporaneous sites - rather than the building of Stonehenge itself. Good to go at opening time on a weekday - when likely to be less busy.,One Could Spend a Few Days Here
"January 1, 2023","We visited twice during our Xmas holiday week in London.  It can be tiring to try to hit everything in one shot.  Lots of stuff to see, I'm sure there is a lot more in storage not for public viewing.  A must see for sure if you are in London.","Never mind the artefacts, stunning building"
"July 30, 2021","We visited just prior to journey home and had not left a lot of time.  What an amazing place.  The building itself is amazing.  Amazing to see Roman, Viking, Egyptian history.  When I visit again will put half a day aside to visit.  Thank you to staff for being helpful and safe as London gets back to normal, great job.",British Museum 15.12.20
"December 15, 2020","Decided to book a visit before we go into tier three(who knows when that will end!).This is my second visit(last one in September).Followed the one way system and was there for 2 and half hours.I prefer the system at the Vand A,where you can go wherever you like without any restrictions.",Big amazing place.
"August 25, 2021",Was a great day but be aware there is a lot to see.  Don’t spend to much time on the bottom floor get upstairs there’s so much more to see.  U could spend all day there brilliant just like the whole of London.  Breathtaking ,Another enjoyable visit to the British Museum.
"April 17, 2018","Although we have visited many times, we just had to go in again while we were in London.  I find this museum very interesting and educational and always make a bee-line for the ancient Egyptian and Greek displays. Once again, we had a very enjoyable visit.  The British Museum is a ‘must see’ if you are in London; there is something for everyone and it’s free!","very large, free, totally perfect!"
"December 12, 2011",This place is extremely interesting and big. There are many things to see and it takes you maybe 2 days to see it all! very big and incredible place.,A magnificent repository of the world's wonders
"May 30, 2018","The British Museum is a special place in the world, where history and culture have been collected and curated for over a century, and where an unmatched set of artifacts exist and are protected and displayed for nearly free. On this level, one can give thanks for the opportunity to come here. For almost nothing, you can see many wonders of the world. On the financial level, I donated the requested 2 pounds based on the sign on the first floor...they asked for 5 pounds on the 3rd floor! Don't forget to donate some money if you are able.Finally, if you are inclined, you might want to consider the politics and ethics of archeology. Museums (and British museums in particular) in the West have come under fire for taking things from other countries and bringing them to the West. At the obvious level, that is exactly what happened to some of these artifacts. I would suggest that one think about the preservation and display that has occurred, as well as the easy-to-criticize expropriation. I myself would be in favor of returning some of these items to the countries where they originated, if they have functioning museums and the ability to preserve the items. However, many of the nations that created these items are no longer in existence, and the great British archeologists and explorers that found them and preserved them deserve at least one cheer for saving them from the fate of too many historical artifacts. In the last decade, entire tableau of irreplaceable elements of ancient history have been destroyed in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq...to name a few of the cases that are known. The Rosetta stone, lest we forget, was once installed into a wall of a fort, and only later became preserved and studied the world over. Shall it be repatriated to Egypt? This is a question to consider at length. If you do so after seeing the benefits of its preservation, realize the benefit you have received before rendering judgement.",A Joke of a place
"January 29, 2016","The Museum as a British Institution of artefacts that have been 'rescued' or generally just plundered by the British, is a beautiful place. Yet the most important facet of the Museum is the people. Of course you may find those in Galleries a little bit strict or the Box office staff a tad enthusiastic. But i think those who made my visit at the museum the most strenous and slightly embarrassing on their part  was the main managers/ supervisors. Watching them deal with a woman having a fainting fit in the Celts exhibition reminded me of something out of an old Benny Hill movie. One man saundered out of nowhere dressed in an outfit that even a politician wouldn't wear to work- Spats that clearly look out of place unless he decided to break into dance, he looked at the lady in question, nodded quietly to himself then saundered away almost hitting himself against a door. meanwhile the first aid staff were sufficient in helping the lady up and getting her to a first aid room. The box office staff were really nice and reassured the rest of us entering the exhibition that everything would be alright. However other supervisors who were there still chatting as the woman was on her way out of the exhibition decided to have an impromptu laughing session about the heating. I'm not a judge of character but clearly having a person who just fainted in front of you, the last thing you need is a senior staff acting like the three stooges (another tv reference) This was mostly because one of them had a weird hairstyle and Mr Spats returned to see the lady led out. I mean seriously, you have people like that in charge, it is an odd sort of management.",The best museum in London and it’s free!
"June 30, 2017","We popped into the British Museum again for a short visit while we were in London.  We always find something of interest whenever we go there - you never have time to see everything in one visit, it is just not possible.The museum is separated into sections for various regions of the world.  There are so many treasures on display here which were ‘collected’ by the British from all over the world.  I particularly liked the ancient Egyptian and ancient Greek displays, they are simply amazing. The British Museum is definitely worth a visit if you are in London and it’s free!",Fascinating
"February 5, 2004","While the arrangement of exhibits is a big eccentric, I find that to be a good part of the museum's charm. Seeing the Rosetta Stone a room or so away from the Elgin marbles (and both on the ground floor!) was fascinating. The new ""King's library"" exhibit, demonstrating the age of enlightenment's awakening to a true study of the past is a unique insight into how the Victorians and pre-Victorians viewed their world as well as that of others.As to crowds, we found that going late in the afternoon on Thursday or Friday (when its open until late) was the best way to avoid the multitude (who seem to leave about 4 heading to tea).",Storehouse of History
"April 9, 2004","The British Museum is one of the most fascinating experiences in London. I visited the Museum on the first Friday of April for four hours in the late afternoon and early evening. The Reading Room in the center of the Museum is incredibly beautiful and historically significant; the new enclosure surrounding it is stunning. The Museum's collections are fabulous - I only saw the Roman, Roman Britain and the Medieval areas during my brief visit. You should plan to see only a small portion of the collections during your visit - plan ahead and you'll have a great time. The shops and the cafe were also very good!",Best Museum Ever for History Lovers
"October 7, 2008","I'm a history fan and this museum is not going to be of much interest to those who are not fans of history.  So...take my review for what it's worth as a novice history fan.  Toured in September, 2008.The British Museum is a FREE museum and also open into the evening on Thursdays and Fridays.  Located within a few blocks of a couple tube stops.  Have audio tours.  Has a cafeteria on main floor and a nicer sit down restaurant on the upper floor.  Couple gift shops.Yes, it has its controversies, but from a pure “want to see as much as you can in one place” type of vacation I was on when there, it could not be beat.  Should it return some of the items it acquired at the height of the British Empire to the countries they were removed from?  I don’t know.  There are two sides to every story but after a visit to the Museum, I can certainly see why some countries want some items back.  They have been incredibly preserved and taken care of and are priceless.  Another reason it’s the best museum ever?  You can take photos.  I do love museums where you can take photos.  It's a huge museum.  The courtyard is beautiful as well.Here are some of the items I saw that were on my favorite list:Rosetta Stone:  Stunning.  One of the most important pieces of history ever.  Discovered in 1799 it is of great importance because it broke the code of Egyptian hieroglyphics which had been lost over time.  On the Rosetta Stone is the same paragraph/decree written in hieroglyphic, Egyptian script and Egyptian cursive.  This allowed for the hieroglyphics to be translated again.  Huge breakthrough.  The Stone is broken and not complete.  It's under glass and always surrounded by people so hard to get a great photo.  Make sure you turn off your flash to try to cut down on the reflection.  Stunning.Cyrus Cylinder:  The so-called Cyrus Cylinder is believed to be the first document on human rights.  Dates to 539 B.C. and was an order issued by Cyrus the Great that states his respect for the religious and political traditions of his conquered lands (in this case Babylonia).  Could be propoganda so take it for what it's worth.Parthenon Sculptures:  Date back to 5th Century B.C.  HUGE room at the Museum containing a number of pieces from the Parthenon.  This is also one of the controversial displays as Greece wants them back because they are an important part of their history.  The Brit’s side is that if they would not have taken them, they would be destroyed like the rest of the Parthenon.  Incredible pieces of history regardless.Halikarnassos Mausoleum:  One of seven wonders of the world.  So important to see since so many of the wonders have been lost.  There are several remnants of the tomb of Maussollos (where the word mausoleum comes from) who ruled Halikarnassos in 4th Century B.C. Cleopatra’s Body:  You see her mummy.  Apparently, the modern day analysis they can do shows she was very attractive.  The Museum has a very large Egypian collection.  Several other mummies also on display as well as other items.Amarna letters:  Clay tablets of correspondence between Egypt and other kings and queens.  They date back to 14th Century B.C.!Crystal Skull:  Saw the fake crystal skull (those who have seen the latest Indy movie will hear him talk about it).  At first, the skull was thought to be an ancient artifact but over time it was found to be a hoax created with modern tools.  Still cool to see.Classicianus’ tombstone:  The British minister appointed by the Roman emperor Nero.  His tombstone dates back to 1st Century A.D.Alexander the Great:  Marble portrait of Alexander the Great which dates back to around 2nd Century B.C.  Good looking guy.Sutton Hoo Ship Burial:  Anglo-Saxon burial tomb pieces which date back to 7th Century A.D. Flood Tablet:  Clay tablet telling the story of the Babylonian flood.  Dates to 7th Century B.C.  Ramesses the Great:  Bust of Ramesses II dating back to 1270 B.C.  The Ramesses line were responsible for the construction of the pyramids.  Nereid Monument:  Turkish tomb dating back to 390 B.C.  It is believed to have been broken up by an earthquake and is put back together at the Museum in a way they think makes sense.  Assyrian Gateway Figures:  Huge figures dating back to 710 B.C.  Made of marble.  Very big.  Assyria is now in what we call Iraq.  There are 5 at the British Museum and they adorned entrances and buildings.  There are also several Assyrian reliefs at the Museum dating back to 7th Century B.C.  Easter Island:  One of the Easter Island statues is at the Museum.  Looks just like you think it will!I spent several hours at the Museum and want to go back again some day.  I had a list of things I wanted to see and that was really the only way you can tour the Museum in any kind of limited capacity.  I hope to go back again and be able to really wander and see more of the treasures this Museum holds.",Slightly Disappointing
"September 20, 2003","After all the wonderful things that I had heard about this museum, I was rather disappointed at its actual content. The things that they do have are rather amazing and impressive, but the manner in which they are laid out does not seem to necessarily be the best possible way to me. Many things seem to be very spread apart with not quite enough explanation unless you rent a headset to guide you or have your own guide with you. Definitely the best part of the museum for me were the Greek and Roman rooms, but other than that, it felt as if we needed a guide just to tell us where to go first or how exactly to make the best use of our time there.",Wonderful Museum 
"November 21, 2022","The British museum is one of the best I have ever been in so many artifacts to see & so little time to do it. You could spend weeks  there and  not see it all, well worth the experience.",See Rosetta stone

We had Lou as our tour guide! informative, interactive, interesting and hilarious guide. His excitement for certain artifacts was infectious! Gave a great spiritual spin on application for many of the artifacts we learnt about, which encouraged me to do more of my own research. Would definitely do it again!  Thank you!!!",Not For Us
"July 28, 2023","Not our cup of tea but I can see why it’s popular with those with an interest in ancient artefacts.  It was really busy, really hot, way too hot!!!  We saw a mum and daughter asleep on a bench - most probably due to the heat!!!",Always fascinating

"April 5, 2016","The British Museum is one of London's best known attractions and is free to the general public.  However, they do ask for a £5 donation, which we were more than happy to pay.  The museum is huge and home to a wonderful collection of artefacts – a real treasure trove.  You really are spoilt for choice because there is so much to see.  We learned about the Egyptians, Ancient Greeks, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings and a multitude of others – all very interesting and educational.  I particularly liked the ancient Egyptian display.  There are many permanent galleries and exhibitions in this museum, as well as some special exhibitions which you do have to pay for.  Definitely worth a visit – there is something for everyone here.",Exceptionally awesome collections

"September 7, 2016",We just had to pop into the British Museum again while we were in London.  It is full of interesting exhibits and we had such an enjoyable couple of hours.There is so much to see and admission is free.  We had a look at the Ancient Egyptian display again while we were visiting as we had enjoyed it so much on our previous visit.The British Museum is definitely worth a visit and there is something of interest for everyone.,Great tour of museum
"June 5, 2005","I used the guide book ""London for Dummies"" and found lots of good tips for visiting London.  One of the suggestions is to take a guided tour of the British Museum.  It costs us about 12 US dollars but was well worth it.  The museum is huge so this let us see the highlights.  The guide was excellent and told the stories behind the displays that you otherwise would never know.  It lasted about an hour and a half.  There are different tours you can take, some more in depth or that focus on particular periods of history.",British Museum – Tips on How to Visit
"February 8, 2014","The British Museum is the oldest national public museum in the world, first opening in 1759 to display Sir Hans Sloane’s collection of 71,000 objects, which he bequeathed to the nation upon his death in 1753.  The museum has provided free admission since the day it opened its doors and has expanded its permanent collection to over 8 million pieces, making it one of the largest and most comprehensive museums in the world.  The British Museum is also the second most visited museum in the world with almost 6 million visitors annually. It is an attraction that is a must-see for first time visitors to London and a place that many English and foreign visitors return to visit time and time again. Because of the size of the British Museum, it is well worth having a game plan in mind before your visit.  The museum is simply too large to visit in a single day and if you only have a few hours to spend here, it is important to do a bit of planning ahead of time to maximise your visit.  Below are some tips for how visit the British Museum 1.) Know the opening days and hours. The British Museum galleries and shops are open from 10.00am to 5.30pm daily with extended hours until 8.30pm each Fridays so you can spend more time in the museum on that day.  The Grand Court area where you can buy tickets to the special exhibitions and pick up Museum maps opens at 9.00am each morning. 2.) Do I need tickets?   The permanent collections at the British Museum are free to visit.  If you feel inclined, there are donation boxes at the museum entrances allowing you to contribute and show support to the museum.  Consider dropping a few £s in the box or perhaps spending some money in the museum shops or cafes to help offset the costs of operating the museum. While the permanent collections are free, there is fee for tickets to the special and temporary exhibitions.  You can buy these tickets online or at the ticket desks in the Grand Court during the time of your visit.  Refer to the British Museum website ‘Whats On’ section for special exhibition ticket prices. 3.) Benefits to visit early or late in the day?Interestingly, and perhaps because admission is free, we’ve never encountered queues entering the British Museum, either at the main entrance on Russell Street or the back entrance on Montague Place.  This comes with a great sigh of relief and theoretically allows you to plan your day more flexibly, knowing you won’t have to wait to see the museum once you arrive (just think of those dreadful queues outside the Louvre in Paris or the Vatican in Rome). However, while entry queues are not an issue at the British Museum, this doesn’t mean that you won’t encounter large crowds once incise. For example, we have visited and witnessed shoulder-to-shoulder people into the Egyptian galleries.  This makes for a much less enjoyable museum experience.  As such, it is still worth considering an early or late visit, when the bulk of the crowds can be avoided. Some attractions in the museum, like the Rosetta Stone, just seem to always have a crowd lingering.  Be patient and you’ll be able to eventually get close to these items to see up close.  4.) Know what you want to see before you arrive!  The number of galleries, antiquities and artworks at the British Museum can seem daunting at times, especially if you arrive without knowing what is available to see and how to go about your visit.  In this regard, one of the most useful things you can do before arriving at the museum is to simply familiarize yourself with the museum layout and determine what galleries and specific items you want to see while you are there.  There are several simple ways to do this. First, we recommend spending a bit of time on the British Museum official website, reviewing the ‘Visiting’ Section and ‘Floor Plans and Galleries’ pages of the website so you can get a feel for the layout of the museum. For those with limited time to visit the museum, you might also want to review the ‘Planning Your Visit – Object Trails’ pages.  Here you can find a variety of suggested walking tours, covering different combinations of museum highlights.  Secondly, it is well worth purchasing a good travel book for London (we like the DK Eyewitness London Guide).  When doing this, have a look at the written section for major attractions like the British Museum, which should include at minimum – a map and layout of the museum, descriptions for the important galleries and highlight attractions within the museum.  A good guide book can go a long way to helping you plan your time at the museum and you can use it along with the free museum Map to help navigate your way around during your visit. 5.) Use the free foldable British Museum Map:  In the Grand Court you will find free foldable Map, which are the single best resource for you to use when navigating your way around the museum.  The map includes not only the museum layout but lists the regional galleries and room names along with some of the most popular museum highlights.  While the layout of the museum is quite intuitive, it remains a vast complex of rooms and it can be easy to lose track of where you are at times. Having the handy folded Map can help you stay on track and navigate your way through the museum. 6.) Wear comfortable walking shoes.  Museums like the British Museum require you to spend a lot of time on your feet.  Wearing comfortable walking shoes can make a big difference in the quality of your visit and your overall experience.  7.) Coffee, snack and lunch breaks!  There are several museum cafes and a restaurant within the British Museum.  They are a bit pricy, as you would expect when visiting museum eateries.  However, it can be a good idea to take a break at some point during your visit and let your feet rest.  This can make a difference if you are intending to spend several hours or more at the museum.  8.) Save the museum shops until the end! There are four different shops within the British Museum where you can pick up souvenirs of your visit.  However, we suggest holding off your purchases until the end of your visit.  The Great Court Shop and the Collection Shop found in the Great Court have a large number of items and you’ll likely pass back through the area just before leaving.  In the end, the British Museum is easily one of the very best museums in the world and it is free to visit.  It’s one of those places that you really should try to make time for when visiting London.  We have been numerous times and always find a reason to go back.",Amazing!
"August 24, 2004",When visiting London we always tend to head straight for the Natural History Museum but this time we thought we would take a visit to the British Museum. We were not disappointed. Many of the artifacts I had only ever seen in books before and it was great to see them before my eyes. The best exhibits by far are the mummies. They are fascinating ( and quite gruesome!). I also loved the peat bog man who I'd seen on television so many times before. The elgin marbles are also worth seeing ( after visiting the Acroplis a few years ago and being disappointed that they were missing! ). All in all a great day out ( and you do need a whole day to see all of the collections ). Recommended!,Must visit
"November 10, 2019","This is a must visit museum in London. Hours and hours of history and exhibits. You can easily spend one full day and you might have not seen everything they have there. A real gem to be visited if you are into museums, arts, and archeology.",The British Museum

The way i see it, and i am a history major, is that the artifacts housed in the british museum are interesting, and have value, but, they are the historic artifacts of other places. If you want to see London, go to the tower of london, or a pub, or anywhere, if you want to see some really cool prehistoric stuff from other places like egypt and greece, go to the british museum.",Great and Varied Collection
"February 4, 2006","Although not a history expert I found it interesting to spend a couple hours browsing the many exhibits at the British Museum. Next time I visit I'd like to take a guided tour since I'm sure they can provide additional background. However, even without a guide I still enjoyed looking around to see what could be found. The Elgin Marbles and the Egyptian Artifacts are highlights, there were many other recognizable exhibit (like the statue from Easter Island). Also be sure to stop by the reading room in the very center of the museum The museum was busy but not overly crowded. You can cover the highlights in an hour or two, but it would easily be possible to spend much longer here. I noticed that other reviewers mentioned the layout of the museum. For 2 pounds I bought a color map that showed the different sections and listed the locations of many of the more populate pieces and had no trouble getting around.",Racist & Glorifying Colonialism
"April 3, 2019","This museum was free, but I want money back for being subject to this disgusting display of thinly veiled racism. Every exhibit is essentially ""look what our friends in Canada/Australia/Africa/etc gave us as gifts""--when it should be accurate to history and admit that millions of people were slaughtered for those ""gifts"". This museum is shameful.",Stunningly awesome & huge diverse collection of exhibits
"July 23, 2018","Being a fan of museums and having been to over 100 countries, This was my second visit to the British Museum, and I’ll likely return on another London visit. I’ve visited many museums. Certainly, this is one of the ten best museums in the world. It is dedicated to archaeology and ethnography. There are 94 galleries, all with excellent exhibits, spread over 807,000 square feet of museum space. The total collection is comprised of over 8,000,000 works of art, prehistoric bones, Egyptian mummies, the Rosetta Stone, and other pieces of our world’s history and people. The largest collections are those dedicated to ancient Egypt, ancient Greece and Rome, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. This is an easy place to spend an enjoyable half or full day, after which at best, you’ll only have seen 20% to 40% of the exhibits. Admission to the Museum is free (donations accepted), but occasionally they charge for entry to some temporary exhibitions and events. Before or after entering, look at the free map of the layout, and plan your tour. Also, I recommend getting the audio guide, to get a better understanding of the things you are viewing and their significance. Museum staff are friendly and helpful.",Seriously needs to review its policy on drinking water!
"July 26, 2015","I visited the British Museum with entire Primary School year group on one of the hot summer days. The pupils had brought water bottles, but naturally the galleries were very hot and very crowded. I went to the toilets to refill the pupil's water bottles for them and found the drinking water sign on the wall but the drinking fountain panelled off. I asked a security guard where the drinking fountains were and he said there were two outside. I walked all the way outside to find the drinking fountains broke. I went to the information desk and asked where the drinking water was and I was informed the fountains were broken and they only provided bottled water for sale in the shop! The children had to go without, I was not about to buy 120 bottles of water! We left instead!I think this is a disgrace. There are those on social media up in arms against the CEO of Nestle saying he does not believe clean drinking water is a human right, and now I find the British Museum in the same camp. Pure commercial opportunism - outrageous.",Frustrating left-luggage rules
"February 10, 2013","This is not a criticism of the British Museum itself nor of its exhibits which are, of course, world-class.Be warned though that if, like us, you have checked out of your hotel and are on your way to a station or the airport with a suitcase, you may be refused entry to the building or will have to take stuff out of your case to bring its weight down to 8 kg. The excess items will then be put into a plastic basket and you will be charged another £1.50.The British Library has a left-luggage facility where you can leave a suitcase, so why can't the British Museum have one?",Audio tour for faster people
"September 16, 2008","There are at least two different types of museum people:- The sort that read every card and truly delve into the mysteries of the past.  They ask deep questions and want to know history- The sort that prefer to proceed quickly through and ""see"" everything, reading the cards for things that interest them, skipping entire rooms if the contents do not appeal.If you are the later, as I am, do not schedule the in-person highlights tour.  Do the audio highlights tour instead IMO. I did both tours in a recent visit to London.  I found myself listening to an incredibly knowledgable guide (14 years at the museum) talk slowly through each nuance of a single piece of history. That is great, but I also about died when we walked by the Rosetta stone and saw 4 people in front of it. Yes, only 4.  We were going in a specific order, so the fact that there would be 50 people later did not (nor should it have) phase our guide one bit.So, we switched to the audio tour. It said the same thing (basically)!  Wow, we were happy. We heard almost the same depth of knowledge, but could approach a piece of history, enter a number, hear the dialogue, then proceed quickly to the next artifact, even room. We saw the entire museum in about 3 hours. We went to every room that was open, and listened to every ""highlight"".  The museum is amazing and incredible.  I especially like the occasional photos beside items of when they were preparing the item for shipment to Britain.  It made it come alive that these items truly came from somewhere, and it took a lot to get them to England.One hint, sometimes the audio tour line in the main lobby is huge.  Go back by the Parthenon area and get the same headsets there with no line.  You do need to leave photo ID to get a headset.",Bible Tours
"May 20, 2006",My husband accompanied me and a small group of Jehovah's Witnesses. We did at least 2 Bible tours with like minded members of my local congregation.

"May 25, 2013",Disliked the fact that the have stolen the marbles from Parthenonas and ask us to donate money every step we took,Heaven for history buffs!
"February 17, 2012","The British Museum was one of my Must-Do's for London and I was not disappointed at all.  For years, I'd wanted to see the things like the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon and the Rosetta Stone and other Egyptian artifacts in person and they were amazing!  A definite don't miss in my book.  Also, I donated a few pounds (even though it's free to enter) just to do my part in maintaining such an awesome collection.  It's worth it!",Go EARLY and PLAN AHEAD to skip the insane queues!!!
"September 27, 2006","If you haven’t been to London since Instagram took over the travel industry, you need to know that London tourism has become INSANE in recent years, with Disney-level hours-long “queues” at every tourist destination. If you are coming during any sort of holiday period (we were here between Christmas and New Years, but apparently this is also true for... pretty much the entire spring, summer and fall!), you MUST PLAN very carefully to avoid spending your vacation waiting on line. We did this and we felt like we had the “Disney Fast Pass” to London! The British Museum is a great example. It’s free, so you’d think there’d be no ticket line. In the past, you could just “pop in and have a look” as the British say. Ah, but you forgot about security checks and crowd control. Today the queue, after forming accordion-style within the gates, continues in concentric circles around the block. I knew about this in advance and therefore was able to avoid it. How? Well, our only chance to see the museum was on the Sunday between Christmas and New Years—pretty much the worst possible time for crowds. So I planned. First, I downloaded all the maps and children’s activity trails (we have four kids ages 6-13) and printed them at home. (The things marked as the museum’s “highlights” form their own lines inside, so you have to plan ahead to avoid those too. Plus, there are even more lines to buy the maps and activity trails that are free online.) I also knew the museum opened at 10am, but I figured the queue might form earlier, so we got there bonkers-early—at 9:15am. At 9:15am on this busiest day of the year, not many people were there yet and there was no queue at all. We walked in, and of course the main galleries were not open yet. However, the gift shop and café in the Great Court were open, as were the already-forming queues for audioguides. So we took care of those things first, and by 9:40 I parked myself by the door that leads to the Rosetta Stone (something you can forget about seeing if you don't get there at that hour... and which is a must-see for historic reasons, but which isn't big or beautiful enough on its own to merit any kind of wait), and summoned the rest of the family to join me some ten minutes later. By the time they opened that door at exactly 10am, an IMMENSE queue had formed behind us. They opened the door and this mass of people surged toward the Rosetta Stone like it was the last flight out of Saigon in 1973. We checked out the stone (and then had trouble squeezing away from it with all the people pushing behind us!) and moved on to the Elgin Marbles (which are about two rooms in, and another thing that generates massive lines), which were totally deserted at that hour. We enjoyed those and then went up to the Egyptian galleries (another major highlight), which were also still pretty empty. By the time the mixed multitude reached Egypt within the next hour or so, we had already completed our exodus from Egypt and had moved on to various promised lands which other visitors hadn’t discovered yet. In this way we continuously beat the legendary crowds. By the time we left the museum around 1pm (yes you need that much time inside!) the queue to get into the building was well around the block. If you come to London during a busy time, do not even consider coming to this museum at any time other than 9:15am. The other tourist places that require first-thing-in-the-morning priority are Tower of London (buy tickets in advance and print at home, get there at least a half hour before opening, and go DIRECTLY to the Crown Jewels... otherwise, that Crown Jewels queue is something for the ages) and Windsor Castle (for this one you MUST get advance print-at-home tickets.... and then tell the security guards that you have them and you may be able to jump to the front of the queue, which without exaggeration is a full mile long around the outside of the castle). You also need advance print-at-home tickets for Westminster Abbey (but those, thankfully, are timed entry, so save your early-morning visits for stuff that doesn’t have that advantage). And of course Harry Potter Studio tickets must be bought months in advance. (Hot tip: I missed my chance to buy those tickets and was still able to get them from something called Golden Tours. A rip-off, but it got the job done and it at least included a bus so we didn’t need a car.) You will have a marvelous time in London, but unlike in years past, you won’t have a marvelous time if you don’t plan ahead. Plan ahead and have a great time!",British museum with non british artifacts
"January 11, 2019","We visited with my girlfriend on a hot August day.No aircon throughout the building, poor staffing and management. Cant imagine what the effect of the heat could be on the artifacts.We primarily visited the museum, to access the Greek Parthenon marbles that were transferred to the UK by Elgin. Let me remind all readers of this review that the marbles were not given back to where the belong with the excuse that the Greeks would not take proper care of them...The acropolis museum though is top 5 in the world compared to British museum which falls short.Otherwise, great collection of artifacts from all over the world, extensive collection, great description and amazing atrium.British museum with limited collection of British artifacts....",Impossible

"August 23, 2018","The Rosetta Stone is worth the trip all by itself, but I have to give the British Museum a Terrible rating for what I view to be false advertising.Hey I'm a tourist.  I relied upon the hours posted on the museum's website when I planned my trip.  The posted hours for Thursday and Friday are 10am - 8:30 pm.  I think many people planning trips to London will do what I did and wrongly believe they can work in their visit to the British Museum during the evening hours since so many other places of interest are closed at night.  Bad idea.  The Museum doesn't tell you that at least half of the museum is closed to visitors during their evening hours.In my mind, the failure to have this disclosed on websites and travel media negatively impacts British tourism.",One of the finest museums
"December 16, 2018","If you want to see the Parthenon, that incredibly beautiful temple, on the Acropolis of Athens which was built during the 5th century BC, or some of the most wonderful ancient Greek art, then visit the British Museum. If you want to see some of the best art ancient Egypt has to offer, or ancient Rome, or other ancient civilisations, then there is really one convenient destination for your next trip and that is the British Museum! Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on your point of view, this Museum has it all. It contains millions of artifacts.  It would be nice if the Brits returned at least some of these invaluable objects to their rightful owners, but that is highly unlikely.  We just cannot resist visiting it each time we travel to London. And it's free!",Stolen goods from around the world!
"January 7, 2012",It's free! (You can make a donation if you like) There's some incredibly beautiful stuff here and things you couldn't find anywhere else unless you spent months travelling round the world.,You can hold real ancient coins
"February 21, 2007","One of the greatest museums indeed. Take advantage of the ""hands-on"" experience! It's basically when a museum volunteer would actually let you hold various items from the collection. When I was walking through the Greek and Roman halls there was this lady sitting behind a small table in the corner. She had a bunch of different coins and some pottery in a box in front of her. At first I thought she was rearranging part of the display. As it turned out, you could actually come up to the table and pick up these things (REAL ancient coins and pottery), and the lady would tell you about them. Here's a picture of the Athenian silver tetradrachma and the Greek 1 euro that has the same owl design. The tetradrachma is 2400 years old.",Day filled with history
"January 31, 2006","The British Museum is definitely a worthwhile addition to any traveler who intends to spend several days in London. The museum is free although donations are accepted at any of the donations boxes located near the entryways to the museum. The exhibits are filled with a wealth of historical information and artifacts, making it virtually impossible to see all of the exhibits in one day. With every turn, one is surprised to see yet more artifacts, statues, and even whole facades of buildings. I spent almost six hours exploring the museum, wandering through all the wonderful exhibits of Roman, Egyptian, Irish, Medieval, African, American, and also some modern projects. I highly recommend a good pair of walking shoes as this museum covers a lot of space.  A guided tour could be well worth it if one would prefer to listen to someone pointing out the highlights about the historical exhibits, items, and stories rather than reading about them by themselves.  Evening times toward the end of the week draw quite smaller crowds than visiting the museum on the weekend or in the middle of the day.",Madhouse Museum
"December 31, 2003","Visited The British Museum two days ago & was underwhelmed. The content is quite interesting, one of my favourites was the Family Tomb - wow!

That isn't the environment I prefer to view art installations in.",Rear Entrance on Montague Place Much Quicker
"May 28, 2015","Few people would disagree with me that the British Museum is a must visit for visitors to London -  because its collection is so rich, its exhibits organised and explained so well, access is so easy and, it is FREE, except areas/rooms marked for special exhibition.Access is easier and quicker through its rear entrance on Montague Place as compared to the main entrance on Great Russell Street.  From the Russell Square underground station, it would take less than 7 minutes to get there after passing through Russell Square.  See photo uploaded.",Badly curated and badly organised
"March 17, 2014","I have been going to exhibitions at the BM for 40 years and this one was an absolute disgrace.  Despite booking two months ago the earliest time I could get on a Sunday was 12.10.  The 12 noon group was large and the 12.20 group were waiting as we did.  The girl on the search bags desk suggested we skip the first room as there would be a scrum in seeing anything - 4 of us paid £70 at OAP rate to skip some?Anyway, the first room was so dire that one of our party did go ahead to see if this was good advice he reported back - that room was just as backed up.I agree with other comments that the contents of the exhibition are excellent but the layout is impossible and frankly, if I were part of the Sainsbury family, I would not want my name associated with it. I heard one young child make the comment ""This is the most boring thing I have ever been to"" and I had to have some sympathy as I was bored waiting to see each new exhibit - not a feeling I have EVER experienced before.The main room with the boat was the first time it was possible to enjoy oneself but even that was too busy.  One of our group found the heat and waiting and scrum just too much and gave up and left - he is not old and ill - this was just unacceptable.We were not the only ones unhappy - we heard nothing but complaints.I have never had to write a bad review of the BM in all these years but I really do feel that someone needs to be hauled over the coals for this disgrace.  I had already made up my mind to write a scathing review so it was so encouraging to read the previous reviews that so many people feel the same way.  I sincerely hope lessons will be acted upon.  For the 4 of us 2 travelled from Northumberland and 2 from Suffolk for a weekend in which this was meant to be the highlight and which proved to be the utter disappointment. The BM should be ashamed.",This not a British Museum
"March 18, 2012","The name must definitely change. This is not a British museum, rather what we got from all the colonies throughout the last 200 years. Having visited the Acropolis museum it's a pitty that the marbles are still sitting in London. I would suggest a more fair name for the museum, that of British Colonial Museum.",Try the Highlights Tour
"April 28, 2008","I have been to the British Museum many times, but this time (April,2008), I took the highlights tour at 10:30 on a Sunday morning. It was a real eye-opener, and an excellent way of spending an hour and a half exploring the museum with a knowledgeable guide. I booked online for STG. 8 (which I thought was very reasonable), and picked the tickets up at the tickets desk on the day.The group was small (about 9 people), and the tour covered many civilizations, from the Egyptian, to the Roman, the Assyrians, the Greeks, etc. Many interesrting facts were pointed out that would have probably slipped unnoticed by the casual visitor.I highly recommend this tour for someone who would like to visit the BM and has only a short time to do so.",Stay away from the museum shop!
"May 11, 2007","There are some amazing exhibits in this museum.  Although sometimes these are spoiled by poor lighting and glass cases.Stay away from the museum shop - the staff in there are not only obnoxious, but they literally walk away from you when you go to buy something!",One of the Greatest Museums in the World
"February 14, 2007","We planned a day at the British Museum, but it wasn't enough. You could literally spend a week walking it's halls and you wouldn't see everything. The trick is to be selective with what you want to see and focus on that. With a background in art (and a longstanding desire to study Egyptology), I limited my focus to the classical Greek/Roman and Egyptian wings.My short-list for the must-see artifacts/exhibits include the Rosetta Stone; the Parthenon Scriptures; ALL of the Ancient Egyptian Culture wing; and, the authenic Easter Island statue. But there is so, so much more. Buy a guidebook and get lost in the richness of this museum. The only downside of the museum is the pricey cafeteria...yes, the British Museum is free to the public but make a contribution in the form of a monetary donation, not towards a stale muffin that cost an arm and a leg. There are plenty of foodstops around the museum to satisfy your hunger after a long day of education & appreciation.",Bad a blast. Would go again.
"December 25, 2023",It’s the British Museum so I have no complaints. My only issue is that it’s hard to appreciate all the galleries in one day and the waves of people who keep entering.,The worst experience ever
"February 3, 2019",I had the worst experience here. Im a mexican and i came as a tourist with my boyfriend from bulgaria. It was our first time here and the people on the entrance didn 't allow us to go inside the museum because they claim we look like pick pocketers. This is the first time we are discriminated like that. They didn't let us talk to the manager and they ask us for an ID. I am so upset at this people. The worst experience ever!!,Worst customer service.
"January 17, 2019","I understand having to go through security to get into such a big museum but the security guards were horrible. They barely checked the bags so what's the use of having the queue in the first place. Then I was directed to a donations counter where a rude bald man basically forced me to donate.

"October 15, 2015",A must see in London. The collections are incredible. This is definitely mind opening and culture and history abound,"Private, Audio, vs Guided Tours"
"December 19, 2006","I've been to the British Museum a couple of times on various trips to England.  I recommend taking the extra time to plan your trip ahead by reading the museum's website.  Some galleries do close early even on the late open nights, so if there's something you must see, plan accordingly.    A previous visitor stated that he went by the times on the website and was led astray, but he simply didn't read carefully enough.  I've coordinated multiple trips to the British Museum, and know that the website clearly lists every gallery that is open/closed on the late entry nights (See http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/visit/lateopening.html).  Gallery closing information is also found on the printed visitor brochures from the British Museum.I've been on both the free EyeOpeners tours, and the paid Highlights tour.  While the EyeOpeners tours are hit or miss (I blame the volunteer guides), the Highlights tours are exceptional.  You'll find each Highlights tour is slightly different as per the interests of the guide you get, but even when the subject matter isn't something I'm particularly interested in, the guides are always exceptional.   The Highlights pace is slow enough to accommodate guests with disabilities.  The size of the tours are limited, so if you are planning your itinerary down to the last detail from abroad, definitely book your tour ahead of time.  You can book these online at the museum's website.I've also been on a private guided tour of the museum by a local historian, which was also excellent.   Our guide  took the time to find out what we were interested in and led us to some of the less-visited gems of the Museum.  Be prepared to hike on  this type of tour as it might take some long walks and hiking up and down stairs to get to the galleries. Of the tour options, the audio tours are my least favorite, mainly because you can't ask questions, and the audio tours make it nearly impossible to converse with your traveling companions.  I wouldn't personally ever use  the audio tours unless you are visiting the museum alone or are a non-English speaker.",Saddening...

"March 17, 2014","Went on Saturday 15 March through a timed ticket allowing entry at 11.20.Hugely dissappointed! There was little in the way of queue management from the staff other than suggesting that we go to a different part of the exhibition then returning later for the exhibits. This showed a complete misunderstanding of the problem because when we tried to get back to the start we were confronted by other visitors and it was like walking against a river current. In general all exhibits were poorly displayed with NO identification (simple numbers would have sufficed) in the text which was always poorly sited at the bottom on the exhibition cabinet. National Museum you should be acutely aware of the queuing problems we witnessed last Saturday as the exhibition has now been running for a few weeks and yet, so far as I could tell are doing nothing about it. The place was so crowded that we left after just 30 minutes to take in the rest of the museum which was as a museum should be tranquil, uncluttered and informative. The Vikings was a complete waste of money and will bear in mind this rather unfortunate experience when we are contemplating another 'special' British Museum you MUST learn and act on the many adverse comments which have been posted from visitors ",British hmm maybe not
"August 4, 2013",I may be a liitle confused but I went into the British museum really expecting to see British history and items from the past.  What I saw was Egyption history and Indian OK maybe the latter was part of the empire but so was Britain so why such limited information about our history.,Life and death in Pompeii and Herculaneum - exhibition only
"May 4, 2013","I was quite excited at getting the opportunity to view this exhibition having visited Pompeii and Herculaneum several years ago and hot having had chance to get to the museums there to see the artefacts.Purchased ticket online, you don’t need to queue at the ticket office, just head for the Herculaneum queue with the print out.  They will ask for your surname (not the credit card you paid with) and with a surly attitude they will say you are 10 minutes early and you have to go back at the end of the queue.So the slots for groups are every 10 minutes which ensures a constant thick flow of people which explains the huge bottleneck on entrance which continues throughout the event.  Initially you crowd around a poor dog which has been eternally captured twisted in agony but don’t expect the rest of the exhibition to follow in this vein.   You shuffle around for the next hour bumping shoulders and on tiptoes to try and look at the usual jewels, crockery, hairpins and oil lights and the struggle to read descriptions before the next person treads on your toe or tuts in your ear.The one exceptional piece, not for the feint-hearted, is a statue of Pan fornicating with a goat, it is in pristine condition and gives you a sense of the humour, craftsmanship and beliefs of the Romans, and this is echoed in the murals, inscriptions and friezes giving you an interesting look into Roman life at the time.You finish off with another moving piece, the display of people in the throes of death, holding their nose and in the boxing position as their terrifying death is captured forever which makes you imagine their death and marvel at the actual size of the person.I left this exhibition a bit deflated.  It wasn’t the lack of value for money £16 I’d spent and not having even a piece of paper to explain in depth what I was seeing and indeed seeing things of which better examples are displayed even within the museum itself; or the fact I had been the sheep in a flock which had squeezed around some silly dead-ended layouts which couldn’t accommodate the swarms.  I think it was the fact that I had pushed, shoved and fought to see some poor soul and their loved ones scalded and burned to death that left me a bit deflated and voyeuristic but then again that’s what I paid for.Please note this review is for the exhibition only and does not reflect on the excellence of the rest of the museum.I am de-selecting wheelchair and buggy access, because of the amount of bodies, lack of space, the narrow lanes to some exhibitions without turning space and taking into account that most displays are above 4'.",Unbeliveable museum

The Elgin Marbles and the Egyptian Artifacts are highlights, there were many other recognizable exhibit (like the statue from Easter Island). Also be sure to stop by the reading room in the very center of the museum The museum was busy but not overly crowded. You can cover the highlights in an hour or two, but it would easily be possible to spend much longer here. I noticed that other reviewers mentioned the layout of the museum.

"April 3, 2019","This museum was free, but I want money back for being subject to this disgusting display of thinly veiled racism. Every exhibit is essentially ""look what our friends in Canada/Australia/Africa/etc gave us as gifts""--when it should be accurate to history and admit that millions of people were slaughtered for those ""gifts"". This museum is shameful.",Stunningly awesome & huge diverse collection of exhibits
"July 23, 2018","Being a fan of museums and having been to over 100 countries, This was my second visit to the British Museum, and I’ll likely return on another London visit. I’ve visited many museums. Certainly, this is one of the ten best museums in the world. It is dedicated to archaeology and ethnography. There are 94 galleries, all with excellent exhibits, spread over 807,000 square feet of museum space. The total collection is comprised of over 8,000,000 works of art, prehistoric bones, Egyptian mummies, the Rosetta Stone, and other pieces of our world’s history and people. The largest collections are those dedicated to ancient Egypt, ancient Greece and Rome, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. This is an easy place to spend an enjoyable half or full day, after which at best, you’ll only have seen 20% to 40% of the exhibits. Admission to the Museum is free (donations accepted), but occasionally they charge for entry to some temporary exhibitions and events. Before or after entering, look at the free map of the layout, and plan your tour. Also, I recommend getting the audio guide, to get a better understanding of the things you are viewing and their significance. Museum staff are friendly and helpful.",I would highly recommend.
"November 3, 2023","We truly enjoyed our visit to the Museum. London is a very expensive place as we all know, and to find some thing as fabulous as this that was free that the icing on the cake",The Most Amazing Thing About The British Museum
"May 16, 2020","Nothing in it is British. Virtually every artefact was stolen at some point in history from another country somewhere around the globe. Egypt, Greece, China, Iran, Iraq, India, Japan, Malawi, Zambia. So to all those bigots and racists that say “we should send all the foreigners back”, maybe we should send all their stuff with them, eh?",Not British....
"August 22, 2019",Excellent museum......but there is nothing British about it.With Brexit time to Greek marbles to... exit.Acropolis museum is much better and more appropriate for the conversation on the Greek Parthenon marbles.,Plan to spend hours here!
"July 24, 2019","The British Museum has such a variety of artifacts that it is hard to decide where to begin. I thought my favorites were the Greek artifacts until I saw the Egyptian artifacts and the cat mummies. But then again the Roman jewelry and the watch/clock exhibits are so cool. Wait! The dinosaurs! You have to see the dinosaurs! Plan to spend the day here and when you need a respite, there is a cafe for refreshments. ",Crowded. 
"June 1, 2019","Great museum, quite a large collection of well-known pieces, however - very crowded, which is understandable - the place has lots of stuff to see and no entry fees. Instead of begging for donations it'd be much better off having a day or two when there are entry fees. I'd much rather pay and have fewer people that just came by because it's free. Other than that - all good. ",Parthenon Marbles
"March 21, 2019",Return the parthenon marbles and everything that is stolen from Athens. It's a shame..... nice museum with stolen exhibits.,It was only a matter of stealing!
"January 29, 2019","The hole museum was filled with exhibits for other cultures that has been removed for their origin countries. Seeing those exhibits remote from their home countries was very miserable and the guests receives a feeling of nervousness. Additionally, when we try to enter the part of the museum that the stolen Cariatid from Athens was placed, it was close to the public as the security guard should be there at 3:00 but he arrive after 3:15. It was the most disappointing museum that I have never visit.",Ian Hislop I Object: Dissent exhibition - I object too!
"September 13, 2018","I object to having to pay for this exhibition which was sponsored by a bank and with a celebrity ‘curator’ when the disparate pieces were all found in the basement of the archives. So nothing was spent on acquiring more interesting stuff and very little on the cramped minimalist display. It was a very poor experience with some of the items hsvjbg only the most tenuous link to the very broad subject of dissent. Having gone to excellent exhibitions at the National Scottish Museum, our expectations were high but we left very disappointed and wished we had spent more time in the museum itself. Don’t bothering going.",How is this free??
"February 28, 2017","The British Museum is an amazing place.  While part of any visit should include a discussion on imperialism and the impacts of cultural appropriation, the amount of history in this place is astronomical.  From the Rosetta Stone (yes, the real one) to Viking treasure, you could spend weeks in the British Museum and only scratch the surface.The building itself is gorgeous, and any one of the rooms would be worth the price of admission (did I mention it's free?)  This was hands down my favorite place to visit in London, and since it's free (right??  free??) you can visit for only a couple of hours and still see some truly amazing history.",British Museum
"November 20, 2016","We knew that the British Museum is home to exhibits from all over the world, but we did not expect there to be so comparatively little from Britain. The main areas on the ground floor are devoted to Egyptian artefacts, the Parthanon display and a few other pieces (Greek and Roman) which are spectacular (Especially the temple). However there were so many pieces in the Egyptian section that were spectacular and impressive that many actually seemed lost amongst each other. In contrast the Parthanon display was a breath of fresh air, there was space to enjoy the exhibits, controversy about them aside. Sadly a couple of the rooms and routes in this maze of an area were closed.The african art display was fascinating, room 1 reassuringly traditional, reminiscent of a stately home perhaps, we enjoyed the Mexican room for it's simplicity of arrangement giving clarity to the exhibits. The death display was similarly clear.Upstairs we completely missed the Japanese gallery, were awed at the spectacular decoration of the coffins and mummies as well as the other artefacts in this egyptian gallery. Found connections with home in the coins exhibition, and sought another in the roman one (found it as well). These rooms are very traditionally laid out with Glass cases and labels, they could do with a few more seats for those of us who have a limited mobility and find carrying the folding stools awkward. We found the Sutton Hoo display with the vikings, leading to a display of pottery from the last couple of hundred years, which was odd. The sutton Hoo display was fascinating and well presented, the vikings was sparse, but being resident in York I guess I am spoiled in that regard. We spent three hours perusing the 90+ rooms, the staff we approached were all helpful, especially the security guard at the gate. The left luggage office has a weight limit of 8kg per bag, but is a useful facility. There are several shops, the ones in the great court offer most interest, we didn't use the cafes.We enjoyed our visit, though we feel that many of the displays concentrate too much on the spectacular and are confused. There also seem to be thousands of orange and black greek urns around the place. We left having enjoyed ourselves and certainly having feasted our eyes, but somehow disappointed. We had learn't little of the cultures represented, but had seen many of their treasures. What about the people though. In addition there was so little about Britain itself, which seemed odd. indeed the British Museum has only half a dozen rooms of British artefacts it seems,is this really all the British museum can muster to show visitors to our country our history? It seems to me a missed opportunity.",NOT TO BE MISSED 
"August 18, 2019",Spectacular museum which guard historical treasures from all over the world. The heritage of the great conquers of the massive British empire. Absolutely a must see in London that deserves several visits to truly explore it.,Fantastic experience 
"July 26, 2019","We arrived early in the morning. The lines were low. After getting through the doors, the learning began. We didn’t have time to explore all the rooms. We chose to do a self guided tour instead of a guided one. The gift shop was massive with many options. So enjoyed our time. Next time back, we’ll have to explore the areas we failed to see. ",Everything You've Ever Heard Of!
"July 25, 2019","The British Museum has all the things you've heard of: the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles, Cleopatra's Mummy (no kidding!) A full day will only barely get you through the Ancient Civilizations, Ancient Greece, and Rome. You will NOT be disappointed! Only complaint: the weather was perfect outside 70 degrees F, but the Museum ranged from warm to hot.",Something for Everyone
"July 23, 2019","First of all, the British Museum is free, so you already go in with a smile. Secondly, the lines are not very long (at least not when we went in). Having waited two hours in the rain to get into the L’Oeuvre, I appreciated the accessibility. The museum is large, and there is much to see, so it’s nice not to feel that you don’t have to get it all in during one visit. It’s so easy to get in, you can just come back. The art here is mostly 3-D, with an emphasis on classical antiquities. If it’s paintings you want, you’re in the wrong place. They did have an interesting collection of Rembrandt sketches (free) and a special exhibit of Edward Munch ($) but otherwise it’s all sculptures and artifacts. The map includes a “must see” list, which made it easier to navigate. The biggest treasure here would have to be the Rosetta Stone. Try to see it early in the day, because it does get busy. Some of the other recommendations were a bit disappointing, but we found other unexpected treasures along the way. I especially enjoyed the clock room, which had beautiful, intricately designed automatons. Having seen Hugo, I have developed a soft spot for these machines. There’s something about the marriage of art and science that seems so complete. If you have a day in London, I recommend you go to the British Museum. You’ll find some unexpected treasures in a relaxed atmosphere. ",Manga Mania
"July 22, 2019","Me and my two kids went to the manga exhibit and we saw the history of the manga from the 1800's to now! Great fun for all, and I recommend a visit!",You could spend hours to days here
"July 20, 2019","Really enjoyed the British Museum.   Great to see the Rosetta Stone.  Word of caution. The second floor restaurant is reservations only, but the Cafés on the main floor where you pick up your food then walk to a table served good sandwiches. Also back elevator to floors 3,4,5 had long lines. If you can do the stairs that’s the way to go. If you are in a wheelchair there is only this one elevator to those exhibits so be prepared to wait. ",At British Museum looking at the Rosetta Stone
"June 27, 2019",We were at the British Museum looking at the Rosetta Stone. People were calmly working their way up to the display taking turns and everyone was getting a chance to get their photos and view the artifact. Then a C Tour group rushed in and started shoving everyone and trying to push everyone out of the way. A man put his hands on me and tried to push me out of his way.  I am a foot taller than him so that did not work for him.  The museum needs guards to protect the other visitors..,Unfriendly and unhelpful staff
"June 5, 2019",We were looking for a quiet room and were given misinformation a number of times.  We were eventually advised to go downstairs where a very unfriendly staff member told us to move on. She then started to speak to someone on the phone clearly speaking about us. The whole episode left me upset and has put me off going to the British museum ever again.,A fascinating place and free entrance
"May 8, 2019","The place is neat and pleasant, there is plenty to see in the museum, antiquities from many countries and continents, mummies from Egypt, ancient Asia and more. You can take a map at the entrance where you can know where to go, there are workers everywhere that can help you in directions. A very good experience",Halloween 31.08.2018
"October 31, 2018","The Halloween evening event was rather disorganised from the beginning. All members had to queue outside for 30 minutes or more before being allowed to enter (when they could have used the time to hand out the programme for the evening which took time to understand - what was on, at what time and which room). We entered the building provided with a plastic chip (purpose unexplained) and not knowing where to go except guided either towards a bar or a ticket desk. We found out the chip was to be used for 1 drink at the bar. Then on to the ticket desk. The reason for the ticket desk was also unclear - not explained in the programme until you arrived at the queue itself. Standing in one of the two ticket queues we suddenly had to select 1 of the 3 tours on option (not knowing what the 3 options actually were(unclear from the programme) and explained to us very quickly in a hasty manner. The personnel also seemed somewhat stressed and appeared to not handle the crowd too well. By this time you walked around seeing more queues to activities that were not yet open and not knowing what to do except to head towards the car to eat something which of course took time and then finding out we only had about 2 hours to go around the activities with having attended 1 tour which lasted 40 minutes leaving little time for walking around to find a space to join in on activities. Due to this, we actually didn’t manage to join in on any activities just became a mere standby observer. For the money and the expectations we had of it being an event organised by the British Museum, I would have expected a better organised event. ",Stoolen tressures
"December 10, 2016",Definitely it is interesting to see the wolds history gathered in one places however it is very sad to notices that most of the items are stollen from cointries which had their own history.,So much to see

"November 23, 2015",Makes you really envious of the kids growing up in London as they get to be exposed to so much culture early on. Wish we had more time to spend there!,Great way to spend a few hours - or a day!
"August 28, 2015","A wonderful museum, everyone is bound to find something to interest them in there! There's so much to look at, and the rooms are so vast that even if there are a lot of people, it will never feel crowded. You can take your time to see the exhibitions, take one of the guided tours (they have different lenghts depending how much time you have) or using the audio tours. They have one for kids as well!They have hands-on stations, with museum items you're allowed to touch. I got to touch a 350 000 year old hand axe, the mind boggles! There are many of these stations around, and a lot of interesting information to be had, for adults and kids alike. The museum is free to enter, and I heartily recommend giving The British Museum a visit, whether it is a rainy day or not. You will be awed by the beautiful collections and inspired for years to come! I have been there 3-4 times now, and I still haven't been able to see everything, there's so much to discover - and all for free!",Sunday Morning - Should have taken a walk in the Park
"December 20, 2014","Possibly the most disappointing visit to a Major Museum I have had...ever.Free entry does not offset the facts the Museum was difficult to navigate, the staff looked poorly motivated, I witnessed some being quite short tempered with the visitors (excited kids), some huddled around portable electric radiators, guess it's hard to be enthusiastic when you are cold. Some galleries were shut, many of the exhibits were missing from there places in the display cabinets, so much so that I thought the Viking and Sutton Hoo exhibit had been burglarised...This Museum needs to get back to what it used to do very well, educate and excite young minds, the administration appears to have lost its way.Also the Acropolis / Elgin Marbles exhibition is an EMBARRASSMENT, these should be returned to Greece and viewed in context at the new Acropolis Museum, which incidentally should any of the Museum Managers read this, is a modern museum which gets it.Visitors should take a minute to read the exhibition notes, I really have not read such politically incorrect and patronising drivel since the 1980's. What a disappointment, I really should have gone to the park.",We HAD a 15 item Plan !!
"September 10, 2014",We only had a small amount of time to visit this wonderful museum.  We had a map and were walking around finding the exhibits when we ran into one of the museum's administrators - and she was wonderful.  She asked to see our list and actually smiled about the items that we had chosen to see.  She was definitely helpful to us.  We came to see the Rosetta Stone and stayed for so much more.   Be sure to not miss this wonderful experience.  It is maintained in an excellent state.,"Key exhibitions are superb, rest less so"
"May 6, 2014","Wear comfortable shoes as this museum is vast.  It covers pretty much every civilisation since early man. Its breadth is in part its weakness as some of its exhibits are simply too small to do justice to every facet of human history and I felt there were a couple of surprising omissions from some of mankind's formulative centuries.  But its main exhibitions and those rooms for which it is justly famous are breath-taking.Must-sees are of course its Egypt and early civilsations (Greece, Rome) rooms but it also has some fascinating tangential exhibits such as its one on clock- and watch-making from the very earliest to the present day. Access for less mobile visitors is so-so.  There are elevators but spaced far apart but they've done what they can with what is an antique building in its own right.  Food - from Benugo - is good by museum standards, and seating in the main court area plentiful.  It's worth visiting just to see its 'floating' glass roof but don't rush your visit or you'll leave feeling like you missed something - which you probably will have done!","too many crowds, couldn't see the exhibits!"
"March 22, 2014","Oh dear!  Most of us had travelled a long way and spent our money on trains and petrol to get there:  only to be confronted by hordes - and not Viking ones, but hot and discontented visitors - attempting to get close enough to the glass cases to see their contents!British Museum, you should be ashamed of yourself.  You have sold far too many tickets for each slot.  The overall atmosphere, rather than being a pleasure for your visitors who have all paid an entry fee, was one of annoyance and phrases such as, ""This is not good enough"", ""Well really, who do they think we are?  I feel like part of a herd of cattle"" were echoing through the halls.   Not an encouraging indicator of a good day out!So, I am afraid, along with many others, I shall never know what was in those first cases.  Get to the boat after struggling through the crowds and missing a lot of exhibits and things fan out so that you can breathe at least.   But then you begin to realise that the contents of the cases are not fully covered by the captions next to them.  Questions such as, ""Well, what is that thing on the right then?"" were also heard.   And the whole exhibition lacked any atmosphere or any excitement over who the Vikings were.  One thing I did love was the Norse audiotrack ricocheting over the whole exhibition. Even that perhaps could have had translations interspersed to give the excitement of the content being read.So folks, if you are going, be prepared to fight your way through heaps of bodies to get to the cases and don't expect a seat to collapse on until you are three quarters of the way through the exhibition.  This is not for the faint hearted, but then the Vikings never gave us Brits an easy time!  Perhaps the British Museum thought they would recreate that for us - and have certainly succeeded!",British Museum- viking exhibition
"March 21, 2014","I love the British Museum and consider it to be one of the best, if not the best, in the world.BUT the Viking was a disaster and a complete waste of money. I went for a 3.00 pm slot but it was absolutely packed and I couldn't see anything in the first section.Such a shame because the British Museum usually does these things so wellBryan Tomalin",Viking Exhibition
"March 18, 2014","What should have been a fascinating exhibition was spoiled by the large numbers of people being allowed in at once. Surely the point of having timed entry is to prevent this? Wouldn't it be possible to display the exhibit captions above the cabinets in some way? The great crush of people, particularly in the first room, completely blocked the captions (which, being grey on grey were difficult to read in any case) so I didn't know what I was trying to see. In other exhibitons I've visited, magnifiers have been provided to see the intricate detail of pieces of jewellery, but not here. The entire exhibition was laid out to be enjoyed by a small number of people: how many people get the opportunity of a private viewing?",Vikings - beware!
"March 18, 2014","I would advise anyone planning a visit to this exhibition to buy the catalogue instead and avoid the frustration of possibly the worst visitor experience I've ever had at any exhibition. I had a timed ticket for 12.30 on Monday 17 March, and expected that visitor numbers entering the exhibition would be regulated. Instead, I was met with crowds of people, three or four deep, some attempting to look at the exhibit, some bending to read the low level labels but most looking at, and fumbling with their audio guides. It was impossible to see anything in the first room and I moved on, only to discover that this was the pattern throughout this extremely poorly designed exhibition. As a result, I missed many of the exhibits entirely. When I was able to focus on something which caught my interest, it was almost impossible to work out what the exhibit was since this was unclear and too often the ill-matching ""description"" simply referred to which museum had loaned the artefact. The museum authorities should take steps to immediately reduce numbers entering the exhibition, remove audio guides which add considerably to congestion, replace the signage and perhaps employ a more competent exhibition designer in future.",Poorly organised viking exhibition
"March 17, 2014","When we saw that this exhibition would be coming we immediately booked our trip to London from the Netherlands. We were really looking forward to it, and the disappointment  was therefore enormous when we were let in just to enter the back of a non-moving queue. After about 10 minutes we decided to give up the wait (we had not yet reached the first display), and walked on to try to get a peek here and there. Which was not very successful either. My personal opinion is that for special exhibitions like this no audio tour should be offered. People tend to stand still and listen until the soundtrack for that particular object is finished, they then move on to repeat the process. This means that they are hardly moving, leading to insane queues.So if you are going to London and consider visiting this exhibition - don't!",Atrocious overcrowding
"March 12, 2014","In the main rooms there were crowds 2 to 3 people deep around every display.  With no formal queuing system inside the exhibition and the amount of people it meant one would have to spend a great deal of time waiting and jostling to get near any item rather than simply enjoying the visit.  We tried skipping a number of cases, thinking to see a display that was less busy and then return once the other display had become freer - however it was so busy around every item this strategy would not help. The only conclusion is that too many people have been allowed in..  After a few minutes in the exhibition we gave up and left.Either the museum has made a huge mistake and/or they have decided to pursue revenue at the expense of the visitor experience.  Very disappointing.",Viking Exhibition
"March 10, 2014",Interesting viking stuff.  But much of it is impossible to see. It's a slow over-crowded shuffle through dimly lit rooms past poorly displayed artefacts.  Explanations and presentations are minimal. The big viking ship is impressive at first glance - then you discover almost all of it is a steel reconstruction.  I left early and disappointed at having been able see little and learn less.,Viking exhibition
"March 10, 2014","We visited this exhibition yesterday, the British Museum have missed a wonderful opportunity. Like everyone else we would agree that the amount of people spoilt many things. The exhibits need a second information label higher up so that people not listening to the audio can read them easily, sometimes you can see some of the cases but not read the information as it is too small and too low.The first exhibit is a big let down, so small after queuing for some time, it needs something startling to make you want to go on! Models of viking life, home, clothes and games would have been great and more interesting for the children. It needs to be much more exciting. Simple museums in Norway and Denmark are much more enlightening, informative and atmospheric. This exhibition was very sterile.The toilets were a disgrace and we had to complain, obviously no one had been to check them for hours, I can't imagine what visitors to Britain think.What a shame. The British Museum should be able to do much better!","Poor Customer Service, but do they care?"
"April 6, 2013","Went there today to see the Pompeii exhibition. Had the London 2 for 1 voucher printed off and 2 adult National Rail travelcards. The girl at the ticket desk was rather surly and said that the offer was not valid at weekends. I pointed to her the terms and conditions that I had printed from the website showing nothing which stated that this was a weekday-only offer. She took a leaflet out and showed me it was a weekday offer. Fine. My sister who I was there with showed her Eurostar pass and knew from colleagues that this had been accepted for the 2 for 1 for staff members. The girl refused this too as she was adamant that we would pay full price.Unfortunately, it is very much a case of luck with who you end up being served by, as I'm certain that a customer-focused employee would have been friendlier and flexible.As far as the exhibition went, it was good, but not worth £15. It took me an hour to see from beginning to end.The organisation of the entrance to the exhibition left a lot to be desired. The screen outside shows the ticket time, but when you queue up you are told to wait (or even worse instructed to go to the back of the queue!) as there are others in the queue with earlier ticket times. Very crowded and messy way of getting people in.Apart from that, the food and gifts in the museum are vastly overpriced, however, this didn't seem to deter tourists from emptying their pockets.",we called it the 'british loot museum'.......
"January 3, 2013","..............as almost everything in it seemed to us to  be something precious stolen from somewhere else. On the up side it is a superb building with a massive range of artifacts. It is free admission which is to  be complimented in  this day and age.  They provide helpful maps and we did the 10 item 1 hour tour and in so doing you get to see a lot more than the 10 items set out in brochure. My favourite were the reall mummies ancluding mummified pets which weren't listed in the 10 at all. On downside it was raining day we went and was very very busy. crowds were almost intimidating and on basement floors th heat was uncomfortable. Still, a worthwhile visit even if we do think they should be giving a lot of the stuff back to it's original owners",Excellent free attraction - too much for one visit
"February 5, 2012","I only visited the free parts of the museum (the majority of it to be fair) and still I felt a two and a half hour visit hadn't done it anywhere near true justice, with still loads to explore and exhibits to look at. The place is absolutely huge and split up into various sections broadly based around different regions of the world. I particularly enjoyed the Egypt sections. There are lots of guided tours, I caught a bit of the Japan one and it was quite informative, didn't have time to see it all. I personally felt the paid for sections were a bit steep, but if I lived in London I'd probably purchase a membership, which is relatively cheap for the under 26s. Didn't try any food, it was pretty expensive, the toilets were clean. I'd happily visit again to see some of the other areas.",Good museum
"February 27, 2009","If you only have a few days in London, I wouldn't recommend that you spend all day here: just hit the big exhibits, and by big exhibits I mean Egypt, Assyria, and Greece. Very impressive collection of Egyptian mummies, Assyrian reliefs (including the epic winged lions at the entrance to the exhibit), and Greek sculptures from the Parthenon. And of course, don't miss the Rosetta Stone. It's the big black rock that everyone's crowding around in the entrance to the Egyptian exhibit.Three exhibits took about 2-3 hours to see. To avoid crowds, don't go in the weekend afternoons like I did!",Quick access
"November 22, 2019","It was the last sightseeint on our must-see list. Sunday forenoon, right after the opening. There was quiet much people but we pass through the security.The sight of the hallway is unique! Like you are a part of something big :) and the feeling of seeing the Rosetti stone is indescribable! And so many artifacts too.We visit this place but still have time to catch the plane :)",Needs thought
"November 17, 2019","Brought a neighbour here for her first visit to the BM. She was very keen to see the third floor Egyptian exhibits. Much enjoyed - but - peace was shattered within 20mins by hordes of schoolchildren. 2 schools, both from Tower Hamlets, had badly behaved children, a handful or so each but they endangered others - and us - by running around, shouting, flash photography, swinging each other by the backpack, knocking into people including my chum who has mobility issues. The accompanying adults were either oblivious or unwilling to deal with the problems. I hasten to add, most of the children were well behaved and well escorted. Children need education but we adults also have rights too. I felt sad for a number of people who had made a journey to the BM and had their visit spoiled. What about overseas visitors...what on Earth impression would they have got? Do schools get guidance from museums? Do the children get advised of expected standard of behaviour?Our suggestion is: the BM reserves one weekday each week for no organised school visits. Publicises the school free day and then we adults get choices. I for one am fed up with not seeing the Egyptian exhibits because kids are lying all over the floor in front of displays. Plus the noise, plus being pushed, it’s just not safe or pleasant. This needs sorting out.",Beautiful 
"November 7, 2019",It wasa kind of dream to see so closely the best arts from all over the world. You can enjoy with the best artists works in the museum. ,A must visit
"November 2, 2019",This is an iconic museum and a must see while in London. There is only one Rosetta Stone. Their collection of ancient artifacts is unrivaled except perhaps for those things that are still in situ and in Egypt. So much has been lost to destruction and war - particularly in the Middle East in recent years - this museum holds on to some of the evidence of humanity's past.,Off season but still crowded.
"October 24, 2019","Wonderful museum with so many treasures.  Loved the friezes from Athens but really wondered if they should be here.  From what I was able to see of the Rosetta Stone, it was amazing.  Don't miss this site, but pack some patience.",Unparalleled Exhibits
"October 20, 2019",Let me just say this - I believe this is probably one of the greatest museums in the world with unbelievable historical exhibits. We just happened to go in July and it was a cluster with crowds and noise and the hustle and bustle diminished our experience. The museum is worth taking your time and really exploring. It was just too busy for us to really be able to do that and enjoy it. If you're in London 100% you should visit but be aware that in Summer it will be mobbed.,Amazing Museum
"October 16, 2019","We visited on a Saturday and it wasn't too crowdy.If you are visiting the firts couple of times, I would recommend to take a tour or something, because the museum is too big.They have everything you want to see, and you can easily get lost there.We went for 3 hours and it wasn't enough, so you can easily spend a whole morning here.They have bathrooms and the museum is free, although you can donate some money.Tours are paid though.",Amazing place
"October 10, 2019",The British Museum was amazing for anyone interested in world history. You could spend an entire day here and would not see everything. We did not intend to visit this but we are glad we did.,Great Museum
"October 7, 2019","We visited this museum to see two things: the Rosetta Stone and the pieces taken from the Parthenon.  Of course, we saw both and much more, including an interesting exhibit of clocks.",HUGE! Know what you want to do there - or be prepare to spend the day :)
"October 5, 2019","Wonderful! Each room is spacious enough for a huge crowd to move around in. When my husband and I got there, each area had different classes of kids. It was very crowded. In a couple hours, by lunch time, it spaced out a bit. SO much walking! I believe they have portable chairs if you can find them at the beginning. That would have helped me. There are some benches here and there, but I didn't think there were enough. ANYWAYS - The exhibits are amazing! The Egyptian rooms were our favorite. Mummies, tombs, amulets, all sorts of things. Then there is the Greek section, the Rosetta Stone, the gladiator stuff, etc. Down on the first level is a giant circle and there are two cafes. A bit pricey, but did the trick for a snack. It seemed like you could pack your own lunch if you wanted. Bathrooms were on the first level, too. We knew exactly what we wanted to see, found a map, attempted to follow it and saw what we wanted. It still took us a few hours. Security to get in was typical. They did a simple bag check. It's free to get in! Donation based. Totally worth dropping in 5+ pounds per person.",WOW!!!
"January 18, 2019",Amazing museum that I visited 2x during my 12 day stay in London!! Top notch museum! Loved it- especially the ancient Egypt section. I took several of the free guided tours.  There’s a cloak room to drop off your coat and plenty of places to eat inside! Highly recommend!!! ,School topic
"January 12, 2019",My sons topic at school this term is Egyptians so took a visit while visiting London. A lovely museum. Not so much interest to our 5 year old but she did enjoy looking at the mummys. Lots to see. We only paid a flying visit so hope to visit again one day and spend longer as so much to see.,a real success after its renovattion
"January 10, 2019","so pleasnt to be in the glass covered courtyard with its shops, cafes and reception desks; the galleries are often renovated with atste ! I love the Sutton hoo treasure, and the sumerian galleries among others: you can exit by the north entrance and walk to bloomsbury or to coram fields, a small museum of an orphanage patroned by Fielding, haendel and captain coram; you will find shops and cafes at the south entrance",Beautiful building 
"January 6, 2019","The architecture inside this building was a highlight. The displays were not really my thing and i did question how appropriate it was for valuable antiquities from Greece and Eygpt to be sitting in London, but i can see why people who love ancient history would enjoy the place. The toilets were disgusting and it was very crowded too!",🏛Best History Teacher⏳
"January 4, 2019","This is a great Museum, a teacher of human history from ancient times until today.Paths are well defined, starting from the most ancient civilizations, passing through the Phoenicians, Etruscans, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, up to today 's society.You can admire countless relics of every civilization, well preserved and of great value. All accompanied by detailed descriptions on uses, customs, wars, the arts of every civilization.Some rooms are home to beautiful remains of ancient buildings, like some temples recomposed in their originality.The library area is rich in fossils and other curious and interesting objects, such as the first instruments for measuring time and stars.Even here the entrance is free, some shows are paid and you can make a donation to the exit.This Museum absolutely deserves a visit, as it makes possible a fast learning of what has been the history of man from the dawn of his knowledge up to today's human society, with all its peculiarities.",Huge
"December 4, 2018","Was here only half an hour, seen the rosetti stone and the Egyptian part of the Museum. Planning to come back again. Beautiful and huge building.",An American in London!
"November 25, 2018","This museum is extremely overwhelming, therefore, may I suggest planning out a section that you would prefer to see before going. It is absolutely impossible to see all the exhibits in one visit. I went strictly to view the Rosetta Stone the Greek artifacts. I spent approximately two hours reading and taking in these two exhibits. I am looking forward to my next trip to London and another visit to this awesome museum!",Arrive with a Plan and See the Highlights!
"November 20, 2018","The British Museum is full of treasures from across the world.  You could spend an entire day here and only begin to appreciate the depth and breadth of the collection.  It is perhaps the finest collection of artifacts anywhere in the word. We had allocated 3 hours to tour the museum and we were able to see everything that we wanted to see because we had mapped out a plan.Be sure to check out the museum's website before you arrive and become familiar with the collections and what you most want to see while you're there.  We purchased a guidebook that had a map of the museum (maps are not free at the museum) and planned our trip in advance.  It is had to overstate just how massive the building is.  Without a plan, you'll just end up wondering around like a zombie following wandering crowds from room to room.We arrived just after 2:30 and we were able to do everything we wanted to do by the time the museum closed at 5:30.  We didn't have to rush either.  In fact, we were able to ""walk through"" all of the museum; meaning we saw the different areas and collections, but didn't stop to admire every piece or read every plaque.  However, we did see much more in 3 hours than we expected (on top of the highlights that were our ""must-see"").The museum has a sit down café that looked nice and overlooks the central lobby.  They also have some stands where you can buy snacks and drinks.  They have several gift shops around the lobby area where you can buy souvenirs.We did have to queue for about 15 minutes or so to get inside the museum.  The queue is for security, not tickets as the museum is free.  If you have time in London, the museum is a must-see.",It’s become a circus
"October 25, 2018","I’ve never before felt the need to leave the British museum. I couldn’t quite believe how much it has changed since I last came here, a year ago. You can no longer just walk in from the front of the building, which is really quite an important part of the experience. You have to weave your way through huge amounts of metal fences to get to an outdoor bag check that was about as friendly as airport control. There was absolutely no need for it as if there wasn’t a huge queue. However, surprisingly, once inside it was so busy you couldn’t actually see anything!! I’ve never seen it so busy before. I went on a Thursday in order to avoid the Friday tourist crush, but apparently the British museum is now just a place tourists go to take photos of everything in hoards. Merely a year ago you could see things. Which is surely the whole point of even going!Now it’s comoletely unenjoyable for a Londoner to go there.What a shame.",A must see...countless times!
"October 19, 2018","The British Museum has something for everyone...of all ages. Entrance is free although special exhibits charge and the charges can be quite steep. The current exhibit on dissident art is fascinating and well worth the money. We spent several hours looking and reading about art through the ages that creative and clever people have used to express their dislike, opposition, and scorn for political leaders and regimes. Towards the end of the exhibit look out for Banksy piece...genius.",So busy!!!!
"August 19, 2018",We went today and was delighted to discover that it was free entry!It was absolutely rammed full of people. Pushing and shoving in every room.The museum itself was very clean and the staff were very welcoming.Bags are checked before you enter. You can not take food and drink in with you. There are cafes where you can buy food and drink and plenty of toilets - but be prepared to queue for 25 mins to use the loo.The most interesting part is where all the Egyptian mummies are. Fantastic section. The rest we found very boring.There are no interactive areas and we found ourselves walking around and then left pretty quickly.We did sit at the cafe outside for a drink and a snack which was very nice ,"DO THIS: ""Before the museum opens: an introduction to ancient Egypt""  Rating: 10 of 5!!!!!"
"August 19, 2018","We cannot give a high enough ranking to the hour we spent with our guide in the Ancient Egypt area before the museum opened. Our small group of 18, led by a highly knowledgeable museum docent, enjoyed an entire hour alone in this area.We were able to avoid the throngs of people around the Rosetta Stone once the museum opened. After it opened, the place was an absolute zoo. The audio guide line was eternal. Moving in and out of different areas was a madhouse. Once our tour was over, we spent another hour dodging other visitors and hit the highlights on the Things to see list provided on the free museum map.I would spend even more money for more time with a guide before the museum opened. Incredible experience and highlight of the trip for all 4 of us, ages 18-58!",Amazing 
"August 19, 2018","I always go back to the British as the collection itself is amazing. It would be worth it just for the Rosetta Stone or the Assyrian part, but for lovers of history it has endless things to offer (leaving aside discussions as to whether or not some things should be returned to their home countries).A must see. Planning the visit helps but otherwise you can also decide to stroll around and get lost. ","Great building, great history; so much to see, so plan your time"
"August 19, 2018","There can be little doubt that the British Museum is one of the world’s greatest.  The building itself is spectacular, if understated from the street.  Lord Norman Foster’s dome, installed over the Millennium is particularly impressive (for American visitors, this is the same guy who designed the glass ceiling over the courtyard at the Smithsonian Museum of American Art and National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC).  The collection is mind-blowing.  From the Rosetta Stone to Anglo-Saxon burial hoards, there is so much too see. For me, some of the highlights include the Assyrian Sculptures - these are particularly valuable as many have been destroyed in the Syrian Civil War.  Also well-worth seeing is the Sutton Hoo Hoard - a treasure trove recovered from an Anglo-Saxon burial mound in Suffolk, England.  My personal favorites, though, are the Lewis Chessmen - carved in the 12th century from Walrus ivory with fantastic detail and character; they were re-discovered almost 200 hundred years ago on the Island of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of North-West Scotland. Here are a few suggestions that I have found useful for dealing with the size of the collection and other facts of life with large Museums I have visited.Like all great public museums in any major city (London, Paris, New York), security screening is a fact of life - it is essential for our safety.  You will need to plan a little additional time for the line to get through security.  The collection is vast and is spread over several floors and wings around the Millennium Courtyard.  So it’s worth taking a few minutes to sit in the Millennium Courtyard and plan your visit - what do you want to see the most?  Unless you have most of the day, you will need to be a little ruthless about selecting some key highlights that will be your personal priorities.  The Museum’s map suggests some highlights and there are staff in every room who can help direct you to your next must-see.  London’s Museums are built to keep visitors warm and dry in colder months.  This means it can be a bit warm inside, particularly at the height of the summer tourist season.  So plan on taking it gently (you’re likely on holidays anyway aren’t you?) or slimming down your list of must-sees.  For example, prepare to wait a few moments to get a clear view of the Rosetta Stone.  The British Museum will get almost as busy as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York or the Louvre in Paris but it’s worth the wait.  This is a must-see collection, one of the world’s finest.  ",Security Threat
"August 16, 2018",The major problem in all these venues is the employment of second rate customer services on the cheap who provide 'security'. They have no customer training and make the whole 'experience' dismal once you are herded through some plastic antechamber. The oversight of the trustees of the place is dismal and offers a poor representation to the world.,Great experience 
"August 10, 2018",The attention for families is extraordinary!Lovely place to hide from chaos and rain just for families at floor -1Where is Tutankhamun???,Recent visit on Sunday.
"August 6, 2018","To be avoided at all cost!!The queuing started on the pavement along the walls of the Museum. Some tourist became aggressive,probably frustrated at the poor organising of the crowds. The numbers of visitors, their selfie taking activities made any serious viewing impossible. The ladies loos had a 30 min plus wait.Unfortunately we rated the visit as a complete waste of time.",One of the best
"July 9, 2018",This must be one of the best museums I have ever been in. There is just so much to see. Absolutely worth a stop if you are in London.,Simply amazing
"June 28, 2018","This museum it is just amazing, it must be the most important collection to understand humankind.There are so many treasures and iconic pieces of history that you can be there forever. It is a huge museum, so prepare your visit, you could be around 2 hours...or the whole day.  Audioguide is a must, with you will seize the opportunity to visit.Special recognition for a free admission, this is something remarkable in an over-marketed world.",Worst musuem i’ve visited
"June 18, 2018","What a waste!Although there are very impressive pieces on display that was the worst museum visit of my lifeExhibits are messy, not even put together.For example to visit the Egyptian collection you have sculptures on ground floor then mummies on the top floor in a room behind medieval pieces and a third part on the other side of the museum!The atmosphere is more like you are visiting a farm fair with lots of noise, people everywhere and just a global messy display of art pieces instead of cows or goatsIndications inside the museum are as eratic as the rest.For example to access the roman antic sculptures turn left at the entrance where the sign indicates cloak room and pizzeria only!Well pizza is from Italy so the connection is obvious maybe?!The pieces on display are very poorly treated as well. It is shocking to see over 5000 year old relics being left right there for everyone to lean on or touch.Finger marks and stains are plenty on the egyptian or assyrians statues.That just reinforces the feeling the museum gives of not giving a damn about conserving what is on display or respect to vistors and making the place enjoyable to visit.The shop is full of way overpriced stuff made in chinaOk there is a lot of people, but if the museum would enforce a policy of relative silence and respect for the pieces on display then it would be a great place to visitAs it is now with what feels like thousands of chinese tourists groups at the same time all shouting and crowding around the displays making it impossible to see anything untill they are gone, the museum is clearly a place to avoidToo bad because the collection they have is clearly impressiveAlso the lack of clear visiting route and will to organize proper tours makes you feel like England displays every notable prize it took back home from around the world and the museum is not intended to show history but war prizes.Forget tour guides, they are free yes but run just a few times during the day and the museum is so noisy you won’t hear what the guide say anyway. (We tried two times)I enquired about private tour guide, they are not available even with advance booking or whatever money you are ready to pay they just won’t do it.Also, as nearly everything in London, you have the few guided tour of some galleries right at the same time as every other activities in london, namely 11am and 1.30 or 2pmIn fact London is a big city but as each and every spot to visit has the same timing for guided tours you can’t visit properly more than one or two place per day.All in all that museum was the biggest disapointment of our trip.Will return the day order and respect is restored there....Most likely never then....",Simply. Outstanding.
"August 13, 2017",Thank you British Museum for the excellent work being done to keep the world's treasures safe and well-preserved. Visited last 20 years ago and loved seeing all the progress made in refreshing the displays. Cafes were excellent and well-priced. Appreciated the top 10 list for the time challenged. ,Must visit
"August 10, 2017","Must visit Museum. Enter by the 2nd entrance on the back of the building (less queues). If you want to see treasures from all over the world, this is the place.",Quick tip to avoid the queues
"August 9, 2017","I visited the British Museum recently to see the Hokusai exhibition to find long queues outside of the Great Russel Street entrance waiting for a bag check.  I was thankful that I had a exhibition ticket which enabled me to avoid the queues.For anybody who does plan to visit, that there is another entrance on Montague Place at the rear of the museum which is much quieter.  If you use that entrance you might save yourself 30 minutes or so which you can use to enjoy the many fantastic items on display.",Extensive collection
"August 8, 2017","The collection is very extensive and overwhelming. Make sure you know which period you would like to visit and make that a priority. The crowds in August are huge. I recommend getting there early, at the start of the day.",HORRIBLE 
"July 27, 2017","This museum is dirty,  crowded and hot. I am appalled to see people touching exhibits. Not one employee in site and if you did see one they were on their phone! Do yourself a favor-- charge admission fee. Maybe you get more people working to clean and do their job.  All the Greek artifacts need to be back in Greece! I don't recommend this place at all. ",Greal Collection
"July 20, 2017","Great Museum! Greek Section is probably the best.When I visited it had showcased the Cloth of Sri Sri Simanta Sankardev (A religious preachger of Assam) which was a treat.Numismatic section was a little disappointing for me, otherwise it's indeed a great museum.",Always a treat
"June 2, 2017",We have been there many times and it is always a feast for the mind. Do not miss it. The Egyptian collection..the best!!!,BEST MUSEUM IN ENGLAND
"June 1, 2017","This is the best museum in London and one of the top five in the world-------the Rosetta stone, the sculpture and friezes from the Parthenon, the Lewis chess set, Sutton Hoo, Horus, and much more","Rosetta Stone! Egypt, Nevina, Babolyn, other historical highlights"
"May 30, 2017","Perhaps the best world history museum in it.  The British Empires and indeed the worlds oldest purely museum.  Well worth setting aside at least a 1/2 day.  We arrived at 5pm on a day that it was open until 8pm (Fridays) so we had to rush and only do a few areas.  Glad I didn't swing the ""American Pop"" exhibit because you don't come to England to view Warhol exhibits (do you???).  Bottom-line stick with the history and stay away from the political history rewriting stuff and you will have a great day in this incredible museum.",A must see when visiting London. 
"May 10, 2017","This is excellently an curated museum filled with numerous famous works. Although having a grand exterior, it's very easy to navigate and doesn't take 3 weeks to get through like the Louvre in Paris. ",Rosetta Stone and a whole lot more
"September 7, 2016",Visiting the museum was at the top of our list and it did not disappoint.  And free.  I wish US museums were free.,Fantastic Egyptian and Greek Collection
"September 7, 2016",You hear so mush about the Egyptian and Greek antiquities collection.  The collection is even better.   We were also fortunate to see the Sunken Cities - Egypt's lost worlds which enhanced our trips and provided a greater understanding of how Egyptian and Roman civilizations merged.,Humongous collection of cool stuff
"September 1, 2016","It's what you might expect-- a ton of amazing artifacts & exhibits-- but it's great nonetheless. I'd reserve at least several hours per visit to make it worth your while. At least admission is free (thanks, London!) so you can spread your experience across multiple visits if desired.",Not worth the time.
"July 13, 2016","Very full and poorly ventilated. Accosted by rude security staff searching bags for no good reason. Building full (FULL!) of tourist groups with no sense of personal space. Seems to be no capacity at which they close the doors. A shame, as I'm sure it's very interesting, but a hoard of sweaty Yanks all shouting at each other to ""come an' lekkit diss"" really ruins ones day.","Incredible museum. Unfortunately, it should be avoided..."
"July 11, 2016","I have been there three times, once in the ""distant past"", circa 1987 (to be honest, cant even recall this first visit).  More recently, I had the opportunity to visit this great museum in Jan 2015 and July 2016. Sadly, both experiences were horrible, for the museum was incredibly overcrowded. The level of noise and commotion made the entire experience meaningless even though for my last attempt I arrived just as the museum opened! I had hopes this strategy would work, but I suppose world tourism is now so huge that it is impossible to go to this museum and not face an enormous crowd. I love going to museums and have visited some of the most famous ones, but have never had any experience remotely close to these two visits. I’m sad to say that the British museum was one of the few negative experiences I had while in London.  Waste of time, much rather visit the V&A or The Wallance Collection...",Top notch museum
"June 21, 2016",We just arrived in London from Paris and asked our local hosts about sights to see. It was great to know some museums remain free to the public. Easy to get to by underground subway. The crowd was manageable. Wonderful works of art and history abound . Helpful staff. I didn't feel overwhelmed unlike the louvre. We just didn't have time to see the exhibitions. A must see for tourists and locals alike.,Easy to Find and Tour
"June 2, 2016",This museum has some truly amazing artifacts. The Assyrian pieces were mind-boggling. The employees were helpful and the gift shop was top notch. They even sell postage stamps!,You need a whole day... or three
"May 7, 2016","I've been to three major museums (including this one) and each one has its ""thing"" that it offers. If you go just for the Rosetta Stone you're in for a cool treat. However, I doubt you'd be able to just walk in and walk out, because there is a lot to see. There's a lot of Old Testament history from Assyria and other empires from that time that was neat to see. There was also a lot of Ancient Greek and Roman exhibits. I went through it for three hours and only saw half of it. I'd love to go back. ",THE Museum.
"February 28, 2016","So much of the world's treasures are housed under this roof, it is in my opinion an absolute must-see on any trip to London.  I came here straight from Heathrow.   Vast, and completely amazing.  The freaking Rosetta Stone is here.  'Nuff said.  Admission is even free!!!    NO excuse to miss this amazing museum",Great place to spend a day to learn
"February 12, 2016","Love this musuem. It's free of charge, contains amazing artifacts and is well maintained. I urge visitors to give back at least a token sum as money is needed to run this lovely musuem.I enjoyed taking my time walking through all the rooms and picking up new things (not literally of course). There are people stationed in various rooms with artifacts you can touch and feel while they explain to you in detail about the item. Thumbs up! ",A visit to look forward to!
"June 18, 2015","Entrance to the museum is free, but if you want to see some of their special exhibitions there is a fee. I went on a Sunday before the opening time at 10 a.m. and parts of the building were already open to the public. The Rosette Stone was very popular but there is plenty to see...a very wide range of exhibitions....from across all the continents. You will not be disappointing!!","Full of History,, but who's history?"
"February 18, 2015",You need at least a week to see all as there are millions of historical things to see at the British Museum.. Mostly the things stolen from other countries! Arthemis Temple was stolen from our country and it should return to the lands where it is belongs to be and many other things from other countries!,endless
"February 15, 2015","Have to visit in 3 days because very rich place.I loved egyptian room, medieval room and middle-east room.Extrem orient's room was beautiful!!!I loved this museum!!!",Give yourself as much time as possible
"February 12, 2015","Words just do no justice for the British Museum. It is simply the most awe inspiring museum I have every visited. The collections are just breathtaking. I could easily have spent an entire week there. My advice would be to get a guide book on arrival, sit down and have a cup of coffee in the  court cafe and spend half an hour planning your tour. You just wont have time to visit everything so be selective. I checked the website after i visited the museum which was an error as there is a useful facility to allow you to plan your visit on-line - www.britishmuseum.org. The architecture of the building is also worthy of note. I particularly like the glass roof!","Charge for entry and pay more to staff, who know what's going on."
"February 8, 2015","At the subsidiary entrance in Montague Street, there was a list of timed activities, with the instruction to go to the ticket desk for tickets and locations.  At the ticket desk, the woman said there was no such thing and she had no such tickets.Feedback.  Either train the staff or pull down out of date notices.There were large numbers of people just loitering and having conversations in closed circles (none of them looking at exhibits).If you charged for entry, you'd be able to pay enough to get staff who knew what was going on in the museum.  And the museum would be used less like a last choice loitering/getting out of the rain place for people who've got nothing better to do.A museum's job is more than providing free lavatories and a cheap caff for everyone, who passes by.  There are plenty of eateries in the area, so there is no need for the museum to compete with them.",Nothing british
"February 7, 2015","A lot of things in there was not british , though we would see how the great empire was , seeing the iron age and railways",Gives me butterflies
"December 27, 2014",Please do not pass up the British Museum. It was the highlight of my trip. I would fly back to London just to go back to to this Museum. Truly wonderful. And I'm still heartbroken I didn't get to see everything.,"If possible, visit several times"
"November 15, 2014","The museum is free, except for special exhibits.  If you have the time, visit more than once for a couple of hours and return to another portion.  There is WAY too much to take in during one visit.  If you only have time for one visit, talk to the information staff and they can direct you to the areas of your interest.  It is an incredible museum - one of the best in London.","Hot, boring and crowded"
"August 28, 2014","I know this is very subjective, but I thought the majority of the tour was boring. There were only a few things that were interesting. This place is so big, I thought we would never get through it. There was still a lot that we didn't see. It was SO crowded, and very HOT. No A/C in most of the rooms. That made it even harder to enjoy. i just wanted to get out of there asap.",Filled with Amazing History!
"August 5, 2014","Wow, this place is big and filled with so many amazing artifacts from history. There are mummies, samurais, a rosetta stone, what's not to love? A must see when in London.Tips:- Entrance is free but there are many places to leave a donation.- It is hot inside during the summer. I don't believe London believes in air-conditioning, which can make for quite an uncomfortable experience. Use the map as a fan.- There are bathrooms, and there are large lines for those bathrooms. Did I mention it's even hotter in the bathrooms?- This place is so big that you will not be able to see it all on one visit. Pick the most important things you want to see, or wander around aimlessly enjoying all the amazing artifacts, but do not put pressure on yourself to see it all.- There are multiple places to get food. It is fine. There are even vegetarian options. - There are tons of gift stores. - There are so many stairs! Be prepared for a workout. In the heat, because as I previously stated, London does not believe in air-conditioning, or cold drinks.",VIKINGS - yet another badly curated BM exhibition
"March 13, 2014","Great artefacts, rubbish display.  I complained about the presentation of the last blockbuster (Herculaneum and Pompeii) - too crowded, and very badly captioned. I got a very pompuis response which basically said 'get lost, we know what we are doing'.  Well you don't chums, and you have repeated the error with The Vikings.  The problem is simple:  captions at waist level in very small point size which only one or two people at a time can read, and at that, they have to bend down to read them.   This means other people can't see into the display cases, and an unholy scrum results.   And The Vikings starts off with a series of displays where this crowding is at its worse.  The answer: simples!!  Additional eye-level captions, and multiple captions per display case - there's plenty of space to do this in this exhibition.   And do some wandering about and see how the punters are actually getting around the exhibition.  And don't be so dashed pompous 'we know best' - because you assuredly don't.  And this is a great pity, because the artefacts in this show are very interesting, and the story reasonably well told.  I was left mystified at the end, however, with a dialect voice explaining the building of the longboats (at least I think that's what it was all about) - but no explanation of what the dialect was (? Shetland) and why it was being used.  Brits and foregners alike stood around loooking confused......",British Museum
"March 12, 2014",Vikings great disappointment. Labels are at knee height but of more than 100 visitors only 3 were in wheel chairs. Labels should be at eye height. Delays in trying to read them resulted in huge blockage at the beginning. Advice - only book for a v early visit.,Too many people
"March 10, 2014","Overall the British Museum is a great place to visit with many extraordinary exhibits but please don't cram so many people in to the special exhibitions. I unfortunately I visited The Viking Exhibition at the weekend and the queues are long, by the nature of the exhibition many of the early artifacts are small and require a closer inspection. This meant many heads peering in to get a look. This was not helped by there being exhibition cabinets on both sides of the room, therefore not giving a clear path to follow. If you left the queue to look at a cabinet the other side it looked as though you were pushing in to get back in position. Also the labelling was not always clear as to which exhibit it was explaining. None of the items had numbers next to them, and not all were described seperately and so you didn't always know which was which. This wasn't helped by the writing often being at the begining of the cabinet, and there was no posibility of stepping back to reread it after you'd got to the item due to the number of people. The exhibits were of a high standard and very interesting but it was not set out for the number of people present. This may just have been my bad luck on the day, but it made a good exhibition average.",A Truly Awful Day
"March 9, 2014","We paid to see the Vikings exhibit. There are timed tickets so we assumed that they would be able to manage the flow of people going in and out to make it reasonable for people to be able to view the exhibits. We experienced the following issues which impacted our enjoyment of the day:1- Members are allowed in at any time - as this was the first weekend of the show - there were many when we were there making the gallery overly crowded.2- People who get the audio guide (we were discouraged from getting one by the ticket taker as it was ""so busy"") simply stand in front of the exhibit cases (some very small) until the audio guide finishes without any consideration for the hundreds of other people wanting to view the exhibit. Some of the audio presentations go on for several minutes. This means that one person is monopolising the space for up to 5 minutes whilst everyone else tried to peak around them. I am not sure if they are clueless or just extremely selfish but I am afraid this is what happens. We were recently on holiday & went to an exhibit where there was ""standing space"" at the front and ""channels"" for people to move freely behind as they went along - greatly improving the ease of movement for people. I think the museum should really adopt this approach for crowded galleries to improve the flow of people. We have decided that no matter how spectacular the subject matter, it is extremely unlikely we will go to another show here. They are just not worth the frustration and disappointment.",The Vikings
"March 8, 2014","Unless you enjoy queuing for an extremely long time to no avail, don't bother going to th British Museum to see this exhibition, where a timed ticket means nothing and, like us, requesting a refund in order to not waste any more time is far more preferable.","Why British?It should be called ""Greek museum"" !"
"January 24, 2014","The biggest part of the museum is covered with the Greek Sculptures.They are really beautiful,though the ""Akropolis museum"" in Athens -were they belong- is much better and newer.I also liked the egyptian exhibits,they seemed so interesting!!I didn't see anything that was british.Everything was stolen from other countries.So,why is it caled ""British museum""?The admission is free for everyone.Most museums in London are free so eveybody can visit them!","So much to see, plus they have free WiFi"
"October 16, 2013","My goal was to go see the Egyptian collection, which includes several mummies. I was not disappointed, and I found there was a lot more to see than I had time for.I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had free WiFi available.",Rude cloakroom staff
"September 10, 2013","Having visited the excellent Pompeii & Herculaneum exhibition in April, I travelled from Glasgow with a group of 36 pupils yesterday to visit it.  Since the sign said we had to leave our baggage at the cloakroom, we attempted to do this.  When we arrived there, the male attendant was extremely rude, aggressive and unhelpful.  The message he was giving (that they could not accommodate so many of us) was fair enough, but he was extremely unpleasant in his delivery of this message.  When I asked if he could suggest an alternative for us, he said ""go to a train station!"" This was not possible with 15 minutes until our time slot for the exhibition. I asked for the man's name so that I could complain, but was told they do not give out names.  The staff at the entrance of the exhibition were extremely helpful and accommodating and allowed us to take our bags in.","amazing museum, rude and distracting visitors"
"September 8, 2013","first off the main reason my girlfriend and i visited the museum was to visit the Life and Death of Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibit but we spent most of the day here so will review in two halves.The museum itself - The museum itself is amazing, the items on display are stunning to see, everything from the rosetta stone to the elgin marbles, to egyptian sarcophagi and roman frescoes, infact thee is so much to see id say you need more than a day. the fact that it is free to enter is still amazing and although donations are welcomed theyre not expected. like most tourist sites, especially somewhere like london, its advisable to get there early, in fact the earlier the better as im sure the crowds are less and you can actually get close to the exhibits with no one in front of you. you can pick up a map which helps but it only shows the theme and no listing of the actual items on display, but you can get listings for that from the museum shop.The life and death of pompeii and herculaneum exhibition - after visiting both pompeii and herculaneum last year, being a big fan of mary beard and her tv shows both my girlfriend and i were very excited to see this, especially as there are a number of items which have never been shown outside of italy before. although we had planned visiting earlier in the year work commitments meant we were unable to get down to london until september and when we came to book tickets for the exhibition the museum didnt have any for the dates we were in london so we booked through an external ticket website. the only tickets available were for an 11:50 or a 13:50 entrance so went for the 13:50. im not sure if it was because the exhibition is in its last month or that we went in the afternoon and there was lots of people from earlier entrances still there but it was packed. Im amazed that they were letting people in every 10 minutes, id of thought it would be better allowing 30-35 people in every 30 minutes as that would mean less crowding. The rudeness of some people (especially it seems the older generation surprisingly - the WI types, and also it seems that visitors from certain european countries have no manners either) amazes me, both myself and my girlfriend experienced people literally shoving in front of us (at one point one visitor had been doing this to me so much i actually told her what i thought of her), both had our feet stood on and walked into and although it clearly states that pictures are not to be taken i saw plenty of people doing so. the exhibition is great and exhibits themselves stunning and im sure everyone who is interested in the story of these two towns or roman history and has been lucky enough to visit them and this exhibition is thankful to the curator Paul Roberts for the hardwork he has done in pulling this off.for anyone thinking of visiting the museum go early, and those thinking of visiting the exhibition again try to go early but prepare to be jostled about but rude people who have no desire to actually study the exhibits but merely want to be able to say ""ive seen it"" so i would say wear steel toe capped boots and maybe use an offensive perfume or aftershave to make people steer clear of you and give you space",Need eyes in my belly button!
"May 12, 2013","Life and Death in Pompeii and HerculaneumA really wonderful exhibition somewhat spoiled by two things, the first difficult to change, the second quite simple.1. Far too crowded -- yes I know that the more people who are let in the fuller the Museum's coffers, but the numbers they let in at one time half spoils the pleasure of seeing (or struggling to see) the exhibits. It feels exploitative to find that after paying an entrance fee of a good amount of money and booking a time weeks in advance you are jammed in almost as tightly as in a rush-hour tube.2. Do curators ever think of what it's like trying to read exhibit labels that are at waist height in a crowded room? Even if your eyes were at waist level you'd not be able to read much with two to three rows of people between you and the label. I'm sure it's all very lovely when there are only three or four curators in a room admiring the aesthetics of the display's layout, but when there are 300 or so people trying to look at things it's appalling. Why, oh why, can't  labels be mounted above the exhibits? If they were 6 feet or so above the floor and in a reasonably large font people would be able to read them without bending low and peering around other people's bums.",Fanastic Time at the British Museum
"August 5, 2008","I visited the British Museum in July 2008. I happened to go on a very rainy day in early July and the place was jammed with tourists and school children. The museum is so large that seeing everything in one day is impossible. I spent several hours and only saw a few exhibits. Best suggestion is to get a map, plan what you definately want to see and head there first. The crowds around the Rosetta stone are insane and it make take a few minutes for you to get a picture. Also, the crowds were heavist in the Egypt exhibit. The pieces shown were stunning and definately worth seeing. I tried to have lunch there, but there isn't much in the way of places to eat. There are two food counters on the main floor with some seating, that got filled up quickly. There also was a sit down restaurant, but not great for someone that wants a quick and inexpensive bite. I took one of the free guided tours of specific exhibits and went on the one for ancient Greece. The tour had around 15 people and looked at pot making and statues in Greece. It was a very informative tour, you could ask questions and was free. These tours were held all day in various halls and if you didn't want to pay for the museum highlights tour, these smaller tours are an alternative. The gift shop there was also great. If you are a history buff, there were tonnes of books on Egypt, Roman Britan, Greece etc. Overall, I had a fanastic time at the museum. It was one of the highlights of my trip.",One of a kind
"October 24, 2007","Truly a great collection of artifacts that have been taken from all over the world. The main downside is that the place is so massive - you could easily spend all day in here if you wanted to go through everything. As with many other museums, admission is free.For time management I suggest you decide what collections you want to see and check those out first. I found the Egyptian (mummies) and Greek exhibits especially amazing, but maybe just because they were larger in general. There are special exhibits that they rotate through the central area and you need to buy these tickets in advance if you want to go. Be sure to check the website if you are a big history buff or like this sort of thing.There are low cost places to eat (cafeteria style) in the central area and slightly more upscale establishments (cafe and restaurant) on the upper two levels. The cafe food was decent with reasonable prices.",INCREDIBLE
"April 10, 2007",The British Museum is absolutely incredible.  One can't help but to be totally awestruck by the vastness of this museum.  The exhibits are wonderful and allow you to actually feel as if you are part of the period represented.  Without a doubt this is the finest museum on the planet.,So much to see

"January 8, 2020","The sheer number of historical and ancient artefacts here at the British Museum is astonishing, each individual item gives you glimpses into the history and culture of countries around the world. But together they also showcase the true profits and benefits that unbridled 18th and 19th century British colonialism* can offer. The fact that these artefacts, violently acquired** from around the world, still remain on British soil is really something else. I am really grateful and appreciative for the chance to see all of these items, as long as I ignore the gnawing moral and ethical guilt I feel as I peer through the glass at the items tainted by the blood of their acquisition. *(the control, occupation, settlement and exploitation of another country, or in the case of the British Empire, many, many countries)** Read: Stolen",If you like old stuff ...

"August 31, 2020","Hooray - the British Museum has re-opened its ground floor galleries, shop and cafe.  When you visit, you wonder why it ever had to close given the scale of the spaces and the ease of social distancing, especially with face-masks.   It is much safer than going to the supermarket. It might be called a museum, but it is really a place for us to explore and appreciate the different cultures of the world, all the more relevant at the moment when travel is seriously curtailed.  This perhaps is the Museum's USP and one that will increase as other galleries on other floors open up over the next few months, There is a one-way system, but it falls apart with an entrance which is relatively hidden to the Americans and Mexico, so it pays to study the map in the Great Court before you go on your exploration or you may miss something. One of the great successes of the Museum is the connection between ancient antiquities and modern/contemporary art, which is seen in the African gallery and also in the two installations by Gregson Perry and Edmund de Waal, excellent ways of bringing the historic collection into the 21st century.  Grayson Perry celebrates the creativity of unknown craftsmen through the centuries with his ship sailing into the afterlife, carved with replicas of objects in the Museum, placed in front of the Nereid Monument while, in the space of the former British Museum Library, Edmund de Waal reflects on libraries lost through the ages, often through war or religious or political vandalism, and on what it means to be in exile, with 20,000 books from authors all around the world, framed by four vitrines with perfectly-placed ceramics of his own, along with pieces of marble and steel.When the exhibition closes, the books will be donated to the new library in Mosul, rising out of its total destruction a few years ago. Now we need other floors in the Museum to open up so we can explore other parts of the world.... More exhibitions are promised at the end of September.",greek! status

"December 22, 2019","This museum must be one of the best if not THE best broad spectrum institution in the world.   It’s artefacts, styles of presentation and it’s ability to provide historical and contextual interpretation is second to none.Having said that the governors need to consider catering arrangements for a small but significant sector of the population who suffer from Celiac Disease.   No where among the pastries, salads and snacks on offer on the ground floor was there anything apart from the outrageously priced mineral water was gluten free.    In the level three restaurant the maitre d’ politely told me that although the food could be modified to meet a broadly gluten free description they could not guarantee that it was indeed gluten free.   It is clear that little or no thought has been given to this quite serious matter - Celiac Disease can be distressing and very unpleasant.  Effectively the BM is saying to gluten intolerant visitors from far afield that it has no interest in your attendance unless you bring your own food.  The museum could demand a lengthy visit particularly for those engaged in academic work but finding nourishment would require eating out and then joining the interminable queue to gain re-entry.",Get lost in time

"December 8, 2019","It would have been 5stars but for state of the loos. It might seem petty to complain about the state of the toilets but the British Museum is one of the top sites in London if not in the country but what impression do visitors leave with if their experience is anything like mine? BM you need to try harder in providing visitors from all over the world with basic amenities. It’s not the first time I have been to a fantastic exhibition at the BM and then wandered off down dirty and grubby unswept steps to the toilets which are frankly disgusting. Blocked up with piles of used loo paper, dripping soap dispensers, the paper towels placed underneath to catch the drips were absolutely sodden and were dripping onto the floor which was also pretty disgusting. Cubicles were left empty because they were just too horrible to use. The coffee chain in my high Street can do better! The Troy exhibition is fantastic. The way the exhibits are displayed was amazing. The way the visitor was challenged to see both the beauty of the objects and reflect on the horror of war was very effective. But my last impression, well is wasn’t great...",Plan Your Time Well
"December 8, 2019","One day is never long enough to explore the British Museum. It. From the moment you enter - a day is not enough. Speed viewing will leave you feeling you missed something.

Situated in a good area for restaurants and public transportation.","Impressive, very Impressive"
"December 6, 2019","Somehow over the years I hadn't managed to get to the British Museum, seems it's slightly outside the cluster.Well have made up for that now, spent hours wandering it's halls, from Korean and Chinese pottery, to meandering through the history of Egypt. There was still more to see when our legs ran out of steam...should have done 2 days.My favourite (aside from the importance of the Rosetta Stone, of course) has to be the completely pointless but completely exotic clock cum ship which meanders across the table shooting things of a quarter hour basis, you may ask why....but really it's why not.Worth a visit, educational and interesting, I'll go again one day.",Impressive
"December 5, 2019",The museum has an impressive atmosphere. Here you will find many precious exhibits worth seeing. Free entry. Usually there are many tourists. Bags and backpacks are security checked before entering. It is not allowed to make video recordings.,It’s free! 
"December 4, 2019","For a free museum, it is pretty packed with artifacts. We loved seeing the Rosetta Stone and other exhibits. One could easily spend hours looking at everything.

There was no security line when we came in the morning on a Saturday. Very good for a free museum.",One of The Best Stops in London
"November 30, 2019","No trip to London would be complete without a stop to the British Museum. We heeded the research and went after 3 pm. There were no lines to get in, the galleries were easily navigated and few exhibits had a wait— except the Mummies and The Rosetta Stone.

"November 7, 2019","We visited the British Museum for the sole purpose of seeing their Ancient Egypt collection, but couldn't help walking through Ancient Rome, China, and even Mesopotamia as well. The sheer amount of artifacts on display is astounding; it would be impossible to explore even one level of the museum in less than a year!It was a little crowded, and finding a bench to rest on for a moment was a bit of a struggle, but otherwise our visit was amazingly educational and fun. We still can't believe all that was available for free! They do ask for a donation of five pounds, which is very little for the worth a visit to the museum provides.Definitely take a look around the museum when you are in the area; if you are interested in history we would recommend skipping other museums just to spend more time in this wonderful place.",Great experience

"November 4, 2019",Must see especially the Egyptian section. Admission is free and camera allowed. When I was there they had a themed section entry for a fee. You can rent headphones which we did for 7£ each. You can spend a good few hours there. ,Interesting exhibition on influence of Islam on Western Art
"October 29, 2019","Came to see a specific exhibition, but also made sure I visited the Sutton Hoo gallery, which never ceases to fascinate. The exhibition on the influence of the Islamic World on Western Art was excellent, although not one of the bigger ones I've seen at the British Museum. This was good, because it meant that visitors can spend time exploring the exhibits and the very informative explanations. Seeing the work of Western artists trying to capture Islamic scenes and images is both a puzzle and a revelation. There's a wide variety of styles on display, with most of the exhibits from the 19th century, but the first items you see as you go in are from earlier times. Well worth seeing.",One of the world's best
"October 28, 2019","A truly world-class museum, with one of the finest collections on the planet. Many may argue that quite a few artifacts were obtained by questionable means (such as the Elgin Marbles), but regardless, there are few places around the world where you can find so many exceptional artifacts to explore and learn about, particularly around Sumerian, Greek and Roman history.",Lots to see here
"October 28, 2019",The antiquities are outstanding. Egypt and Greek areas the most interesting. Be aware of queues to get in but they do move fast,Well worth seeing 
"October 27, 2019","Actually I went with my sister, but she counts as a friend and there’s no category for just “family”!We met for a day together as she lives in Yorkshire and I live in Kent, and the British Museum was convenient for us both to walk to from meeting at London St Pancras/Kings Cross stations (about 20 minutes each way). Once there we got a map of where everything was (you make a monetary donation, suggested £2), sat and had a very early lunch at one of the several eating cafes, and planned what in particular we wanted to see. This proved useful as there was a fire drill at 2pm (it was a Thursday - don’t know how often they do this, but I think it does say on the website) when they did a full evacuation of the premises. It was obviously going to take a good half hour before we could get back in, so we decided once elsewhere we would return another day. There is just so much to see, most of it fascinating. I wanted to see the Easter Island statue, the Rosetta Stone and the Clocks and Horology, my Sister wanted to see some of the really old artefacts. We managed to see the most important things we wanted to see. In conclusion, well worth a visit but to get the most out of your day I suggest:1. Check their website. 2. Get a map when you enter so you can plan what you want to see most so you get what is most important to you viewed, as you can easily run out of time with so much to see. 3. If you’re taking pictures, what I do is also take pictures of the captions/descriptions/story of what I’m looking at, as there’s so much to take in, I can then look at it all at my leisure later and enjoy it in peace! 4. The shops are worth a look round too for mementos. ",Plan ahead or go with lots of time at hand.
"October 26, 2019","British Museum is a huge archeological Museum with tons to explore and learn. We reached the Museum late just about 1 hour from closing time, you need about 3+ hours to just explore the Museum superficially. I was able to view the Rosetta Stone, Greek, Egyptian Era exhibits and the Islamic section in a brisk manner. Most of the areas were missed. The museum is quite central and a walking distance from Tottenham Court Road Station and Holborn Station. It's a beautiful building and one of best  Museums in the world albeit huge. You need a full day to enjoy this fascinating place. If you have shorter than 2 hours, better Google or explore their website before visiting to pinpoint the exhibits that interest you.",Best Museum !
"October 24, 2019",This is by far the best museum we have seen in Europe and the US.Anyone interested in history of various civilizations over the world may find the best artifacts here.,We love this museum
"October 24, 2019","Where else can you see the Rosetta Stone , the Sutton Hoo treasures, the Parthenon marble reliefs and so much more. This easy to reach Museum from Russell Square or Holbern on the Piccadilly underground is a must see. It holds  the wonderful treasures from. Ikings to Romans and more.","This is the best archeological museum in the world. It has everything that you’ll ever want to see,"
"October 24, 2019","Should treasures be returned to where they came from? I’m not too sure. Natural and man made disasters can happen anywhere and treasures can be lost.  This museum is very respectful of the treasures it stores. Without this beautiful museum, people possibly wouldn’t have access to the treasures from their countries. It was a life long must for me. You need at least a day to enjoy what the museum offers. Bus stops and the metro are a short walk away.",Wow.. mindblowing
"October 23, 2019","This place is so impressive.. the historical artifacts are absolutely mind-blowing.. free entrance, but I know everyone visiting is more than happy to give a donation for this marvelous museum!",British Museum London
"October 22, 2019","Worth spending a couple of hours at this museum, at least 2 hours.A multi cultural experience for young and not so young.",Vacationers 
"August 29, 2019",I'm so glad we went to the British museum. I really wanted to see The Rosetta Stone and I  was delighted to find out one of the Easter Island statues was there. All in all a great experience.,Best museum of the world.
"August 27, 2019","Who said best things are not free? Thanks UK and London for making my visit memorable with this museum. It is free. We went around 5pm and was able to cover most of the artifacts. Best highlights were Rosetta stone, Renaissance arts, Greek , Egyptian mummies including Cleopatra(don't know if it is true), story of money, collection of clocks, China, Japan, India, Arabic artifacts. Don't miss this, if you are in London. Take the map (it is free, but suggested donation of 2 pounds).",My favorite in London
"August 27, 2019",I try to visit it every time I am in London. You can spend the whole day there. It has also external exhibitions of  different artists.,A must see in London
"August 26, 2019","Get there early. The lines can get crazy long. We got there to the back entrance about 30 mins early and got right in. Later they were quite long, even in the rain.Allow for several hours if you want to see everything. There's a lot in there. It's free the way we did it, but there's a paid tour where you go in before it opens. Might be worth it.",British Museum is a must visit
"August 26, 2019","This is one of the must see institutions for any visit to London. The permanent exhibits are never old no matter how many times we have been. There is so much to learn about humanity across centuries.Do try to miss holiday periods and weekends though. It is incredibly popular and the entrance queue can get pretty long. Once inside, it is still possible to get lost and away from crowds depending on the gallery or exhibit you want to see.",Get There Early and Plan to Stay for As Long as You Can!
"August 26, 2019","The first time we tried to go to the British Museum it was on a Saturday and when we arrived there were lines that spawned around the block and it was raining!  We decided that since the museum opens at 10, we’d arrive at 9 and that was a smart move since we walked right in. To our surprise the lobby was open so we were were able to get the feel of the museum even though most of the exhibition doors didn’t open until 10.  I wanted to see the Rosetta Stone and  heard that the crowds made experiencing the early Egyptian artifacts a challenge. Ironically, now that our vacation is over, I was looking at the British Museum’s website and we could have booked a tour to visit the museum before it opened. These tours cost money and if you go on your own it’s free but I regret missing this opportunity and will definitely take advantage the next time we are in London. We loved our time in the museum. Architecturally the Queen’s Court is extraordinary and that’s the “ Lobby” that you enter once you pass through security.  We loved the exhibits on Money, their Watch collection and just about every other exhibit we saw. You really could spend days just trying to learn about all the history that this vast museum encompasses.  I really loved their Mummy Collection. They have lots of cafes throughout the museum to get coffee,desserts and sandwiches. They also have extensive gift shops so you could bring home your own Rosetta Stone mouse pad, magnet or jigsaw puzzle along with hundreds of other gifts and books.",visit in the evening or before closing time to avoid the crowds: Learn something new every visit
"August 24, 2019","This was our 3rd trip to the museum since our last trip 5 years ago.  We visited around day of a heat wave in July and the museum's air conditioning could not keep up with the heat.  It was so hot the doors to the room holding the Elgin marbles were open.   We arrived around 5 pm, it was crowded, there were loads of people, just sitting on the floor camped out in the main rotunda, By the time we left near closing time, the museum had emptied of the large tour groups, the museum had cooled and it was much easier to navigate.  There is a back entrance which we used and did not have a line.The museum map has about 12 highlights marked - some of which we had not seen on previous visit, - we used this as a guide to visit the highlights some of which we had not see before (the astrolabe, the reliquary, the oxus treasure.   Also saw the room of Enlightenment which was a favorite, \ which was blessedly cool and had interesting exhibits. We went back a second day since our apartment was less than a 10 minutes walk and visiting the museum twice made it more manageable than one long visit.",Terrific museum
"August 24, 2019","Arrive early to clear security.  Be selective on what you read & view, only what really catches your eye.  Egyptian area crowded & busy, go there early.Enough to see to fill the best part of the day.Easily reached by metro & then on foot",a place to travel in time
"August 23, 2019","a place to stay long the a couple of hours , so please organise your day considering to stay in the museum even to have a bite. from Greece to Rome and from Rome to the Nile sailing with Cleopatra. just to mention something but you also can visit history from other places like Mesopotamia and Far East , let history talk to you I  strongly recommend to take your time to enjoy this jewell .children only if they want and they are interested in learning.",Amazing artifacts; take a special morning tour if you can
"August 23, 2019","Our family of five (two parents and three teens) splurged and purchased tickets to the Introduction to Ancient Egypt special morning tour, in an effort to to avoid the crowds. Although it's not cheap (£30/adult), we thought it was well worth it, as the tour takes place at 9;00 AM, an hour before the museum opens to the public, and our small tour group had the entire Egyptian gallery (including the Rosetta Stone) to ourselves. Our guide was very informative, although it was difficult to hear her at times, particularly when other museum employees who were walking past us were talking/laughing quite loudly. She/we did not use wireless earphone headsets. As our tour was wrapping up at 10:01 AM, the gallery immediately filled up with the other visitors and tour groups, and there was a huge crowd, 5-6 people deep, trying to take photos of the Rosetta Stone.We spent the next hour and a half, viewing the Egyptian mummies, which surprisingly wasn't too crowded (perhaps because they are located on the third floor) and the Greek galleries. We didn't realize that the Elgin Marbles referred to the collection of sculptures and other pieces of the ancient Greek Parthenon. It was amazing to see them.",Plan a whole day
"September 11, 2019","This place is huge and there is so much to see. Incredible displays of artifacts from ancient times to present day, many countries and cultures represented. Not a place you want to rush through, as we unfortunately had to. Bonus is that it is free (of course a donation is welcome, and worth it).",Could spend years here.
"September 11, 2019",You can get quite an education at this amazing place. The exhibits are thoughtful and well laid out. ,Rosetta Stone
"September 9, 2019","The Rosetta stone is one of the most important discoveries in interpreting Egyptian artifacts. It perimits translation of Greek, Dometic, and Heiroglyphs.  It was displayed in a very nice stand, and the work by Champollon was expained.",Wow
"September 9, 2019",The museum is incredible. Takes a few hours to see. It has quite an extensive collection covering pretty much all ancient civilizations. Absolutely stunning! ,Worth at least a day
"September 9, 2019","A decade after my first visit, I spent an afternoon at the British Museum and covered only about a quarter of the Museum. The Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece rooms are must-sees, but it is difficult to point out anything that is “skip-able” in here. Do take your time. And learn. Stop the silly selfies.",A must see
"September 8, 2019","The British museum is the home of the Rosetta Stone, the ancient Greek/Egyptian translation system. The museum host a wonderful collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts. A must see.",Amazing - very large
"September 8, 2019",Incredible artifacts and display of world history. Allow at LEAST 2 hours. 3+ hours if you want to reach all areas of the Museum since it’s VERY LARGE.Very crowded so plan accordingly.  We arrived later in the day and that helped. Air conditioning is light in some parts of the building so consider that during the warmer summer months.  ,Excellent - Wide variety for any interests
"September 7, 2019","Exceptional museum.  Easy to navigate through the building and collections.  Lots of individual artifacts of different periods and cultures. Detailed explanations of each item.  One of the best I have visited in Europe for simplicity, yet informative and lots of content.  One of the best facilities and presentation I have seen.",Great place to browse
"September 7, 2019",Entry is free but they ask a 5 pound donation which we thought very reasonable.  Get in early (it opens at 10) to avoid the crowd who h builds up by 12.  The Rosetta Stone is a must-see but the Egyptian and ancient English history are fascinating too,Crowed and a bit overwhelming - but very worth it...
"September 6, 2019","We arrived just before 10:00 am opening (free admittance) to find a long line down the street to get through security - that said it was well managed and moved quickly - took about 15 minutes. Once in it is very overwhelming and terribly amazing - so it is best to bit of homework before you go in - the most popular areas are the Egyptian displays with the mummies (it is very interesting and worth a walk-by at a minimum through the crowd) and then the Asian – Chinese areas. The Rosetta Stone is also one of the most famous artifacts in the museum – mush like the Mona Lisa there is a bit of a mob scene there. There is no way that one could see it all and in my opinion any of the areas can be fascinating and worth just spending some time at any area. You can spend as much or little time as your itinerary will allow and it will be worth it. Note that the restrooms/WC are located on the main floor and you have to go down stairs from there – there are elevators down but take a long time and there is a line for both men and women. There is great areas for sell of museum books, clothing, and many other items. There is coffee service in different areas, pizza shop etc. You really could come on many visits and would be worth the visit. Highly recommended.",Amazing museum and waffles at terrace
"September 19, 2019","British Museum is a must in London. Rosetta stone and mummies upstairs are great. Nice restaurant upstairs, but a BIG recommend to waffles from car outside museum. Mmmmm, so gooood!",Amazing 
"September 19, 2019",We loved every aspect of our visit. The treasures are beyond spectacular. We felt especially privileged to see the actual Rosetta Stone. We’re New Yorkers and have access to extraordinary museums right at home. Still - we were blown away by the extent and depth of the collections. We will definitely return!,Awaken your inner archeologist!
"September 18, 2019",This place is a draw each time we come. From the enlightenment room to the Rosetta Stone--we keep coming back. Don't miss seeing some of the most important artifacts in history!,Overwhelming Museum but Great Tour
"September 17, 2019","We did a 2-hour tour with Natasha of Universal Tour Guide.  She was a terrific guide.  She had a great personality, was friendly, answered all our questions, and tried to show us how different civilizations through time independently formed similar beliefs.  You could easily spend a week at the museum and not see it all.  The only disappointment was that a couple of the galleries we wanted to see, especially the Japan exhibit, were closed.",Wonderful Museum
"September 17, 2019","Loved this wonderful museum!   So much to see! Since my husband has difficulty walking, I wish the elevators were a little more prominately positioned.",A must-see while in London!
"September 17, 2019","The British Museum was free and was well worth the trip! Your tour begins with the infamous Rosetta Stone and it gets better from there! There are plenty of guides and an audio tour is available. There’s so much to see, we couldn’t fit it all in but you could easily spend 4-5 hours there! The restrooms are clean, there is a fantastic gift shop and the cafe offered delicious pizza and salads.",Outstanding
"September 16, 2019","This is one of the best muesum's weve ever visited. We especially enjoyed seeing the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin marbles, and the Egyptian mummies. Super impressive for the archeologist in you!",Kudos to the British Museum
"September 15, 2019","Visited the British Museum, once again.  This time, the agenda was the new China and South Asia Gallery.  First stop: security.  Be sure to bring a purse or man purse (no backpack) to enter the short line to avoid long queues.  In the museum, marvel at the Grand Hall.  Wow!  Brilliant use of space and natural light.  Enter the China and South Asia Gallery.  I'm entranced by the blue, ceramic dragon.  The displays share a high standard for museums with clear signage, well-lit displays, and fascinating stories about the items on display and the history of the region.  I’m crazy about the British Museum Chinese Tang Tomb Figures with people, camels, and horses.  A highlight!","Must-see in London, though I missed the Chinese painting/calligraphy collection (not open for some reason)"
"September 14, 2019","The British Museum is on my 'bucket list', and finally I got to cross it, though I'll come again. One of the biggest and finest museums in the world, and it doesn't need recommendations.Being a linguist and a translator, I was amazed by the Rosetta Stone. A souvenir is a must takeaway.The Chinese painting/calligraphy collection was being renovated or maintained or something. But it was not open to visitors, which is a big pity. Maybe a good reason to come again next time.",Family visit 
"September 13, 2019","A must see , if you go to London & have the time . It will be crowded though & possible long lines to get in . There is so much to see , the Rosetta Stone is here . We picked out our favorite things & sought them out as we were there about two hours only . You could stay for days . It is free . ",An absolute must
"September 5, 2019","An absolute must when visiting London, from the Elgin Marbles, Ancent Egypt and all the way up to a recent exhibition on the development of Manga. This is the place of preservation of World culture.Try to arrive at opening to avoid too many crowds, or towards the end of the day and come back. You need a lot of time to visit so do try to plan ahead to know what you want to see as rooms are a spread widely. Great advantage is the fact that the museum is free but does need donations, although certain temporary exhibitions are paying.",Dont miss
"September 4, 2019","If you like travel in history of mankind this is a place to go. They have a numerous times of archeological collections from different eras of mankind. Of course, you can still wanna look the rosetta stone.",Wow! Something for everyone here.
"September 4, 2019","This is perhaps one of the best museums in the world. Free to enter and floors of exhibits (benefiting from years of British Colonial activities). My husband and I separated to look at our own areas of interest and were both blown away by the range and quality of exhibits. Set in a light airy build, easy distance from Russell Square or Holborn tube station, well worth a visit. ",Fabulous A Must See
"September 4, 2019",Most wonderful point was its enormity but not overwhelming. Surprised there were museum monitors everywhere which was relaxing. Fab cafe and restaurant on the second floor. Gift shops (2) were stuffed with all kinds of things . Free Free Free. Elevator but not as many sit down benches though. ALL exhibits were fabulous and well described. ,One of the best civilization musium
"September 3, 2019","My main interest to visit this museum is to see main sections of Islamic art and Egyptian history.I can’t count how many visits I had in the past years,but  certainly I will keep visiting this great museum every time I come to London. every visit I see new things and learn few information.The presentation is excellent and well presented.I have seen many Egyptians Exhiption around the world ,but the British Museum  is the best",LOADS TO SEE
"September 2, 2019","Visited with family,this is where the Bollywood movie was shot. Amazingglass roof,so much to see,felt needed an extra day here,really good lot of history,amazing Islamic ,Greek,Roman,African artefacts. Could be sign posted better as felt didn't know which way we were going half the time. Has a store where you can purchase gifts from also buy snacks and drinks which are pricey. Amazing place to visit,so much to see and take in,could do with ac as it was too hot.",Amazing!
"September 2, 2019","Wonderfull time with kids. They have a lot of history, mummy in a wonderfull place. The glass ceilling is wonderfull.",You Could Spend Days Here
"September 2, 2019","Talk about an amazing museum.  If you have more than a mild interest in history and different cultures, you will find this to be incredible.We spent over 4 hours here and barely scratced the surface in all the exhibits.  Of course, we saw the Rosetta Stone and plenty of ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman artifacts.  Give yourself plenty of time and you may want to scope out what you want to see before you go to make sure you get to see everything that is important to you.",Marvelous Museum
"September 1, 2019","The amount of artifacts and exhibits is incredible. If you don't have alot of time, get the museum brochure upon entering and it will list the 10 items that are highly recommended to see.  Very interesting and informative, you will not be bored.",Fabulous
"August 29, 2019","A great way to see London. Wonderful, friendly and helpful staff. Tickets best pre bought online in a combo with other attractions for best value",Amazing but super crowded
"August 20, 2019","This place is legendary and has numerous amazing items. Plus it is free. So of course it is covered up with people. They could really use some crowd control to eliminate bottlenecks, because there are too many rude people standing blocking exhibits, doors, and staircases. I couldn't get anywhere near the Rosetta Stone, for instance. It was low to the ground just inside a door from the main courtyard, resulting in huge crowds jostling near it and trying to get past it. Very disappointing that they didn't put it up a bit higher, make people stand a bit farther back, and perhaps also mount a huge blown-up image of it in the wall for those who wanted to see its details. The whole place could use a redesign to open up doorways and eliminate confusing dead ends and so many, many stairs. The lifts are super slow. I really feel sorry for the elderly and handicapped trying to get anywhere inside. So, although l think this is a fantastic place, I'd recommend getting there right as it opens if you don't want to be fighting the tremendous crowds.","Marvelous collection, must visit"
"August 20, 2019",You could walk here for hours and days... great collection and I totally understand why people are queuing every morning to get in!,Huge
"August 19, 2019","Huge museum, with thousands of items. If you have limited time, make sure you at least see must see items on the brochure.",World class!
"August 19, 2019","This magnificent museum houses a collection that is rather unbelievable, particularly due to how it is displayed. If you wanted to, you are close enough to four thousand year old relics to touch them (unfortunately, a lot of people did during our visit). As many people have said, it was incredibly crowded during our visit. We were still able to stop and see the displays we wanted to. We had to stake out a table for lunch and obnoxiously hovered as a family finished their meal, but that's what everyone else did, too. The lunch we ate (sandwiches and salads) was tasty, and everyone who worked at the museum was very kind and helpful when we had questions. The best discovery was that down one floor to -1 is the family floor. It's really just a giant locker room with tables, but it was nearly empty. There are places to sit, and a toilet that is always free. You are only allowed access if you have children. I know we missed tons of exhibits, so we will definitely be back some day.  You can't beat free! A must see in London!",Beautiful Museum
"August 19, 2019","This is truly a beautiful museum. Came to see the Greek Section , which was truly fascinating.The. Building is amazing , it was a truly a lovely experience .",Beautiful Museum with something for everyone
"August 19, 2019","I went specifically to see the Rosetta Stone which was amazing in itself. The museum houses so many treasures it is not possible to see it all in one day. No matter what your particular interest, you can find treasures that will satisfy. It is crowded, but if you bear with the crowds you will see some of the most beautiful human creations.And you can have a nice cup of tea and a scone in the central lobby!",Amazing museum
"August 19, 2019","I have been here before, and I missed the Rosetta Stone so wanted to come back to refresh my memory.It’s free to enter however donations can be made easily when you enter. It was very busy on Saturday as the weather was cloudy with some rain predicted. I heard one female parter suggest they should get a refund as it was so crowded but her male partner reminded her it had free entry....Whilst crowded you can still move about reasonably easily with only the most popular exhibits have too many people.I started high that is went to the top level and came down level by level. There are so many categories however for me it was the middle eastern art, the Rosetta Stone and the Greek areas that impressed me most.I liked the portable folding chairs you can take free of charge to enable you to rest as needed. Acts as a walking stick as well.There are lifts if needed.So an amazing afternoon. On this trip been to the Louvre and the Hermitage museum and this has less artworks but is in the same class of museum.",Maybe the best museum in the world
"August 19, 2019","The artefacts in this museum are some of the most famous and astonishing you will find in any museum. The Rosetta Stone is worth the trip alone but the other big attractions include The Elgin Marbles and the Mummies.If you're travelling from abroad, dont miss this museum.",Heritage of the world
"August 19, 2019","What can one say about BM that has not already been said? It is not just a London, or British but a full-flown world institution in every sense of the word. The content, exhibits, organization, the venue, the building, the historyb the courtyard with the glass roof, the free admission.Only, it takes a lot of time, focus and stamina to see it all. It is better if one has a plan what to see, or a special field of intetest. Or come again, and again.",Fabulous!
"August 18, 2019",I could have easily spent two or three days in this museum. Never have I seen such an extensive collection of ancient artifacts in one place. Amazing!,Best part of the vacation
"July 28, 2019",We easily spent half the week working through the exhibits. The only thing I would suggest to them is more fans in the summer time in the ancient areas on the second floor.,A great museum
"July 28, 2019",The british museum is one of my favorite museums in the world. Endless exhibitions ranging from ancient Egypt to a room about modern currency. Everyone can find something they will find interesting.I visited during Edward Munch special exhibition on its last day and it was incredible.,Massive free museum
"July 27, 2019","We spent over four hours here and still missed large portions of the place.  Best to space out over a couple days if you can afford the time.  Very educational and impressive.  The museum is free.  On the day we went the line took only 5 minutes to get through.  After two and a half hours we decided to take a break and went across the street for some tea.  We then went back to the museum for another two hours.  Same quick entry and again free.The Assyrian collection, the clocks collection, and the Nereid Monument (in the Greek collection) were among the greatest highlights.  This museum is a must if you have more than a day or two in London.  The gift shop here is enormous.  You'll want to set aside some extra time for the shop if you're looking for a gift for anyone.  Impressive amount of cool history books for kids and adults.",A fab museum
"July 26, 2019","So much to see, needs more than one visit. Beware it gets incredibly busy so looking at the exhibits can be tricky, especially the more famous ones and especially for children. So go early or at the end of the day.The Egyptian rooms are obvious favourites! Such things to see.",Rosetta Stone and the mummies
"July 25, 2019",Great place for children.  We decided to limit our visit to delve deeper into what we saw instead of broad shallow gaze at what the great museum can offer.  This gave us the real example to touch upon a part of history with the Rosetta Stone.  The mummies were completely different from what we have in Louvre.  It gave the children different feel of the mummies and how it looked like.  The preserved mummies gave us another topic to touch upon.,Vast Collection and beautiful architecture
"July 24, 2019","We went in July during 25 degree weather. Inside the museum, only those rooms with fabric or paper are air-conditioned. Can’t imagine how some of those workers coped with the stifling heat. It was 28-30 inside. The collection itself is impressive, especially the mummies, the Egyptian artifacts, and the Greek rooms of the remnants from the Temple of Apollo. My son was especially impressed with the Manga exhibit. Be sure to check where the bathrooms are, because the ones beside the central bookshop are always crowded. I walked over to another one and it was empty. The workers there are very kind and helpful, especially the gentleman in the jewelry shop who wrapped our treasures well and gave us recommendations for further explorations in the city.",Great Museum
"July 24, 2019","So much to see. Especially loved the mummies. The museum is bright, exhibitions are wonderful. There are guided visits who h we did not do.",Don't go on a hot day in summer!
"July 23, 2019","Sadly our visit was marred by the heat and lack of air in the building.  No attempt to help visitors - not a fan in sight anywhere!!  Food for sale was out in the heat, including things with chicken in and cream .  Cakes, etc all out with no covers on so could be coughed and sneezed on by people waiting to be served. Then nowhere to sit down.  It's quite frustrating to have so many attempts to sell you food without providing sufficient places to sit and consume them.  Many people ended up sitting on the stairs, which made getting past tricky at times.  Not enough ladies loos so queues there too. One I visited had the only two hand dryers out of order and no paper towels. Also I saw a visitor try both sanitary products machines and neither worked. I felt totally ashamed at the service we were offering foreign visitors.  More attention needs to be given to the visitors experience.Lastly, although it says bags will be searched, with is fair enough for safety, it would help if they also told you that some items will be confiscated.  I was not allowed to take in a small pair of scissors used for crochet.  I got them back at the end of the visit but it meant going back across the museum to get them.  Such a shame as what little we were able to see was good. We won't be returning though.",Very educational!
"July 22, 2019","This is a fantastic opportunity to see the Rosetta Stone and many famous sculptures and artifacts. Bring the kids! Oh and bring your sketch pad! Great gift shop if you aren't an artist and want to bring home a piece. plus, they have a special library. ",Not in the summer 
"July 22, 2019",Too warm and too crowded on a summer day. If we go again it will be out of season. Not worth the long wait.,Always a great place to visit
"August 7, 2019","This is always a great stop for anyone interested in world history.  The museum contains a treasure trove of relics - Rosetta Stone, Sutton Hoo, mummies, etc.  However, this time we visited with our grandchildren and bought admission to the Manga exhibit.  They are into anime and were thrilled with the exhibit.  They were able to see some objects they had only read about and were able to have a unique experience.  Of course, there are always crowds at the museum, but admission to the Manga exhibit was controlled by ticket entry times.",Excellent museum and a must see when in London
"August 7, 2019","We took my six year old daughter and she was fascinated with the mummies and other artifacts. It was a long visit but so good to see the worlds items all in one place. Expect a super long wait to get in as the crowd goes out the gate, down the street and around the corner. But it's free so what do you expect. I'd recommend going in the afternoon around the 2ish mark.",British Museum - A Biblical Perspective
"August 7, 2019","The British Museum is extraordinary and so vast, that you would have to camp there for a week and still not see it in its entirety. Best advice is go with a plan of what you want to see. You will find plenty of unexpected treasures on the way, but at least you will not have that sense of being totally overwhelmed. On a recent visit with friends, we chose to concentrate on exhibits directly linked to the Bible. It is amazing how many finds confirmed Biblical facts that some had held as 'myth'. Well worth a tour!  The Museum sells a guide called 'Through the British Museum with the Bible' (also available on Amazon etc.) which points out the significant exhibits and also their location, which is helpful. There are a good few online articles also about these particular exhibits. We did it in 2 hours, which for us was just enough and left us with plenty of ideas for future visits. Entrance is free, unless you are going to any of the special exhibitions. This is really a worthwhile thing to do if you are in London!",Great Anceint artifacts throughout the museum!
"August 7, 2019",This was a free attraction...yes...free....and as such it was a very crowded hot mess the day we went. Spend the couple pounds and get the guide so you know where to focus your energies. It is a HUGE place and you can get lost. Be prepared to fight your ways through the crowds to get a close-up look of the Rosetta Stone. You have to be patient and sometimes a little pushy here....don't bring a stroller!!,Great to visit
"August 7, 2019",The British Museum is one of the most exiting place to visit in London and in the whole world. There only two disadvantages: No. 1 is that the Museum is too big to see all exhibited treasures on one visit. So have to come back. No. 2 the queues at the two entrances can be very long. So an early bird ...  (and choose the right entrance (Northern side) since main entrance is always busier)!,One of the best
"August 7, 2019",The British Museum is one of the best museums in the world. It's free to visit and there is so much to see you could be there all day.,I never miss stopping in when in London
"August 6, 2019",The long lines outside move super fast! With 2 million exhibits there is something for everyone! It’s spotlessly clean -how is that even possible and how many popl must work there after close each day?!,Amazing place - must see in London!
"August 6, 2019","Can't believe that there is no entrance fee for this, one of the greatest museums in the world. A massive collection and a beautiful place. We took a guided Bible tour (through an independent company, not the museum itself) and it was worth every cent as the museum is so massive it could easily be overwhelming.",Lots to see!
"August 6, 2019","We always visit museums when we travel. The British museum has a tremendous number of artifacts from all regions of the world, most from the ancient world but some closer to our time period. There is just so much to see that in my opinion pick a couple of time periods or geographical areas that you want to see and concentrate on them. We spent just under 5 hours and by that time we were just spent! Our legs and minds could not take in anymore. Well worth the visit for sure.",Bible tour
"August 5, 2019","Highly recommend this museum with a guided bible tour. It was amazing to see the rossetta stone, and other artifacts that pertain to Bible history and the true God Jehovah. If anyone is a bible student, take it!",So much to see!!
"August 3, 2019",Great museum!!! We enjoyed seeing the museum-- even with our super bad jet lag. The Egyptian items and the chess sets were or family faves.,Too much to see in one day
"August 3, 2019",It's breathtaking how big the collection of this museum is and therefore it is quite impossible to see everything in one day. I would recommend to make a list of things you want to see in the day that you are there or to do the highlight tour which the museum also recommends.,History at its best
"August 2, 2019",I have been to many museums and this is one of the best. It has a collection of world artifactes very few can match. I have visited Egypt and the number and quality of the exhibitsare on par to those in Cairo. To see the Rosetta stone was special.You could easily spend a day exploring but a good 3-4 hours is a minimum to appreciate the wonders here if you are in a hurry.  The exhibits are well presented and organized.,Shame
"July 31, 2019","Of course you have to visit the museum, but be prepared to get very very angry. The place is a huge restaurant, with gift shops in the middle. No respect for the marvels that are there. No order, no security, they just asked us if we were carrying weapons, we said no of course, no air conditioning, people are running up and down with no plan. Do something for heavens shake",Amazing but so crowded
"July 31, 2019","The British museum is amazing with collections dated back 3000 BC. The mummies were so cool to see in person! But be aware it was SO crowded and hot! We rushed trough the museum because of this. But its free and worth it in our opinion! When we walked around the building we saw that you can actually enter at the back of museum, which had no lines!! It seemed to be for regular visitors too, so I would recommend visitors to try that entrence before the main one!",Must See
"July 30, 2019",The British Museum is a definite must see.  It has so many different items to see and experience.  Some of the exhibits are an additional cost.  We did some research before going to get a good idea of the items that we wanted to see at the museum.  Definitely doable without a guide if you like just wandering around.,Great with Kids
"July 29, 2019",I had first visited this museum as a kid myself so going back as an adult with my own children was so much fun.  My girls 12 & 10 loved it.  They especially loved all the Egyptian artifacts.  This is a great place to visit with our without kids.  And the free admission is a bonus 😉,Best part of the vacation
"July 28, 2019",We easily spent half the week working through the exhibits. The only thing I would suggest to them is more fans in the summer time in the ancient areas on the second floor.,A great museum
"July 28, 2019",The british museum is one of my favorite museums in the world. Endless exhibitions ranging from ancient Egypt to a room about modern currency. Everyone can find something they will find interesting.I visited during Edward Munch special exhibition on its last day and it was incredible.,Massive free museum
"July 27, 2019","We spent over four hours here and still missed large portions of the place.  Best to space out over a couple days if you can afford the time.  Very educational and impressive.  The museum is free.  On the day we went the line took only 5 minutes to get through.  After two and a half hours we decided to take a break and went across the street for some tea.  We then went back to the museum for another two hours.  Same quick entry and again free.The Assyrian collection, the clocks collection, and the Nereid Monument (in the Greek collection) were among the greatest highlights.  This museum is a must if you have more than a day or two in London.  The gift shop here is enormous.  You'll want to set aside some extra time for the shop if you're looking for a gift for anyone.  Impressive amount of cool history books for kids and adults.",5000 years of history in an afternoon 
"July 19, 2019","The Rosetta Stone - appropriately shown first for this unlocked so much of what we know. Statues of Ramses II (probably Moses’ Pharaoh), mummies of people and cats, Assyrian temple statues, collection of Greek pottery illustrating evolution of fluidity in art. Not least, the Parthenon friezes statuary (The Elgin Marbles). Stunning and beautifully displayed. We visited at a busy time ( mid-July) and in the busiest time of day (noon - 3PM) on a Friday ( a day the museum stays open late ) but it was amazing anyway. There are guided tours every 30 minutes and a self- guided audio tour. Rick Steves has an excellent audio guide to the highlights through his app. We broke for lunch halfway through our visit in the cafe -surprisingly good food. We heard the restaurant was very good too. ",Great Museum.
"July 18, 2019","This museum houses some seriously famous pieces like The Rosetta Stone, The Lewis Chessmen, Hoa Hakananai'a Statue from Easter Island, Egyptian Mummies, and more. Admission is free, except for special exhibits, like Edvard Munch (The Scream), Manga, and more. Get tickets for the special exhibits in advance, since they sell out. The building is an architectural treat as well.",The Morst Outstanding Museum in the World!
"July 17, 2019","You could literally spend weeks in here! I saw people with little folding stools and they would move from exhibit to exhibit and sit down to read all of the information. The highlight for me was seeing the Rosetta Stone, but in tack pottery from the time of Moses is also spectacular. This is well worth any time you can give to it. ",Outstanding 
"July 16, 2019","Get there early for opening. It gets very busy by lunchtime.Go straight to the Egyptian rooms. You won’t be disappointed, and they seem to be the most popular.You can easily spend all day here.",Massive permanent collections plus lots of temporary ones
"July 15, 2019","This is a place to visit everytime you have a chance.First of all, it is free!!!, for such an incredible place, works based on donations, so please, considering you are in London don't be cheap ;)For that donation, you have access to some of the greatest history collections in the world, Greek, Roman, Pre-Hispanic, Pacific, etc... beautiful... and the temporary collections are also great. You should spend there at leastttt, half day, easily a full day to see everything. Pity seeing people taking a picture of Rosetta Stone and leaving without probably understanding the meaning of that stone.... Go there if it is your first time in London, go back if it is not.",Expansive Collection Worth Visiting
"July 15, 2019","The British Museum is amazing. So many artefacts from civilisations around the world. It is a photographer’s delight - Greece, Egypt, the Roman Empire, Africa, etc, etc. Mind you whilst there is a lot to see, there are lots of people there as well. Lots of groups and individuals all walking in different directions. Simply amazing. Entrance is free but they ask for a 5 pound donation. It is worth every penny.",Wonderful museum
"July 11, 2019","I loved visiting The British Museum.  There are so many wonderful things to see and experience.  I paid to visit the special Edvard Munch exhibit, and it was well worth it.  I only wish I had spent more time here.",Amazing museum with a myriad of exhibits
"July 11, 2019","The museum is huge, so plan on spending an hour and a half at the very least. The mummies are not ideal for squeamish individuals.",An Excellent Musuem
"July 10, 2019","The things you can view in the British Museum are unbelievable and they have spaced them nicely so you can go around them in many directions instead of just past a perimeter.  The museum welcomes many people and it didn't seem too crowded when we went.  You must come through security which took about 10 minutes.  There is no admission price, but you can make a donation, if you wish to.  Some areas do not have air conditioning and they are quite hot.  We were told this is due to the harm that AC can do to the artifacts.  The cafe on the 3rd floor was serving beautiful trays for High Tea.  Had we not recently eaten we would have loved to have had the chance to stay.  ",One of the best but most crowded
"July 9, 2019","I really appreciate the fact without paying you can enter the museum to see most of the exhibition, however, having too many visitors in the museum kind of made the experience less good. A stunning collection of Asian treasures.",So much to look at
"July 3, 2019",If you are spending a lot of time in London this is worth a visit as there is so much to look and it is a interesting building. If you’re only in London for a few days it wouldn’t be at the top of the list ,American Mom and 12 Year Old Son
"June 26, 2019",Free- Gorgeous.  Extended hours on Friday.  Many unique displays.  The Rosetta Stone in person.  A little crowded.,Everyone should see this!
"June 23, 2019","The amount of history packed into this museum is amazing. It's free to get in but I recommend buying a map for a couple pounds. You will need it unless you just plan to walk through every area which could take hours. We didn't have enough time to spend all day there so I looked online at the top things to see there and used that to focus on the general areas that I wanted to concentrate on. The Egyptian, Roman, and Greek areas were my favorites. I couldn't believe I was actually looking at THE Rosetta Stone. The Elgin marbles which came from the Parthenon were also spectacular. There were so many breathtaking things to see from small artifacts to huge statues. ",Museum is great
"June 23, 2019",Wow!  There is history here that I do not think you will find anyplace else.  What era are you interested in?  It is there.  Most (if not all) of the globe is covered.,Great Exhibits & Exhibitions
"June 22, 2019","We went to see the Edvard Munch Exhibition at the British Museum. The Exhibition was easy to find and well crafted, with many original works by this influential artist. There were clear descriptions of Munch’s main sources of inspiration, with several touching backstories. We also had a quick look at some of the other impressive exhibits, including the Egyptian mummies and the Chinese and South Asian artefacts. Well worth a visit!",Huge Museum Great Egyptian collection
"June 22, 2019","Of course you have to take a photo of the Rosetta Stone! I was hoping the Magna Carta was here too but I didn't get to the British Library where a copy is kept, bummer. It has amazing Egyptian collections but we really enjoyed the Asian section - small but well curated and very well represented of the many cultures of the East, not just China and Japan. We spent almost the whole day there and my 12 year old was not bored at all.",So much to see!!!
"June 21, 2019",We planned to spend about 2 hours at the British Museum and take in as much as possible. The galleries go on and on and on....I’m sure you could visit many times and still discover something new! The museum certainly is a national treasure.,A Day at the Museum
"June 20, 2019","It would probably take at least 3 full days to see all that is at this museum.  We spent our day mostly in the Egyptian, Roman and Greek areas.  It was very educational and amazing.",Great!
"June 20, 2019","First of all it’s free so if you have the time why not go? There are a lot of amazing things here such as Egyptian, Roman and Greek artifacts. ",Crack for history makors
"June 16, 2019","I cannot possibly type enough here to justify the scope of this museum.  It is unlike any other in the world.  All historical era, ages, and regions are accounted for here.This is the mothership of history.  Due it justify and spend a whole day here.  5-6 hours minimum.  ",British ??
"May 16, 2019","Sorry, to me it was a collection of ""prizes"" the British empire plundered whilst on a series of jollies, quality material, rather, in my opinion, placed thro-out the museum with no real start/end, much more enjoyable at the Imperial War museum, every-body to their own!!",Yet another great one.....
"May 16, 2019",British museum is another great place in London to spend an afternoon.  Elgin Marbles a MUST SEE.  But so is everything else.One of the BEST gift shops around.,London 
"May 16, 2019",All museums are free in London. The British Museum is very good. Beware they set you up for a donation as part of the entry process s d there are donation boxes everywhere throughout the museum. We made a donation on our way out once we had an appreciation of it. We also go sucked into buying a map between the entry doors and the information area inside. There are free maps inside! The Egyptian section was my favorite. I’m biased as we were in Egypt last year. Allow a few hours for this one.,Worth the wait
"May 15, 2019","Big lines on the weekends. Don't carry a bag and you will pass thru quickly. The different areas are amazing and the centre glass roof is awesome . Greek, Roman, Mummys are all on display. . Grab a map.",A must see in London
"May 14, 2019","I took the audio tour, the one that had 20 stops around the museum. For 6 pounds I got a great exposure to most of the exhibits in about 3 hours.  I loved this museum but I highly recommend a guided or audio tour otherwise it may be overwhelming. I plan to go back with my son when he is a little older.",Amazing 
"May 13, 2019","There is so much to see, you can easily spend a whole day there. There is also a couple of cafes inside to keep you going. ","Impressive, endless, very interesting."
"May 13, 2019","One of the most spectacular museums in the world! They have a complete collection of all cultures, but what impressed me most were those of Egypt, Greece, Mesopotamia.",Munch exhibition
"May 12, 2019","I went purely to go to Edvard Munch special exhibition this time (travelled 200 mi). Excellent collection, thoughtfully presented (I’m not arty one by the way). The space was well planned, pleasant place to be & informative, interesting display. I thought whoever planned it had a lot of thoughts into it & made a fantastic job of it. I recommend booking tickets online in advance. I’d seen a lot of tourists just passing by & wanted to get in, only to be turned away at the door as the tickets for the day had sold out already.While you’re there, the new(-ish) Japanese gallery on the top floor is worth a visit. The last time (summer 2018) we were there, it was closed, so visited for the 1st time. I was impressed they had “Haniwa” & other items rarely seen nor known outside Japan.",Amazing place!
"May 12, 2019","If your intention is to see the whole museum, you may need a week.  I particularly enjoyed the Egyptian galleries.  Many great pieces to see from all over the world.  We used the hopper bus to travel there.",Great antiquities! Schedule time for this museum.
"May 12, 2019","We have centered several trips to London around a visit to the museum. The Brits have acquired some of the world's most prestigious ancient artifacts from Egypt, Greece, and Rome.The centerpiece of the museum, the Rosetta Stone, is a must-see!  ",Definitely worth going!!!
"May 12, 2019",Great collection and definitely worth visiting. I do recommend arriving early when the museum opens as there is usually a long line outside. The entrance is free. I loved the entire Egyptian and Islamic World collection.,Hartwig! Bring back the Paleolithics!
"May 11, 2019","Among glitter and gold, priceless artifacts, and unimagined treasure, I saw a lady at a stand holding a simple rock. She told visitors that it was the oldest thing they would ever hold. I took her up on the offer. She told me it was nearly half a million years old and from the site that defined the Acheulean industry. I felt deeply connected to this ancient homo erectus as I realized that this is the tool that built all other tools. The flintknapped hand-axe was perfectly balanced in my palm. I’m a software developer doing the very same thing today. Thank you British Museum for this truly magic moment. Hartwig Fischer – please bring back the paleolithic exhibitions in full.",So many things to see
"May 9, 2019","You can easily spend whole day here. To make it more fruitful, focus on a few items that you targeted to see.",Amazing
"May 8, 2019","Get a good grasp of prehistory by visiting the outstanding British Museum. Be prepared to look at many wonderful little things, and read! You will learn much!",Perfect activity on a rainy day
"May 8, 2019","Loads to see, sometimes would be nice to have interactive displays rather than old fashioned things behind glass displays. We loved the ancient Egypt display.  Very crowded on the weekends, however its completely free. Lovely restaurant on the mezzanine in the large hall, serving excellent cakes and light meals.",Great museum
"May 8, 2019","Worth a visit, plan your day so you have at least 4h, hudge museum, great for adults and scool kinds. Free entry. ",Holding the world's treasures in escrow
"May 8, 2019","The BM is literally a trip around the world in 80 days. In the space of a lazy afternoon you will gain an appreciation for the histories of many countries the British Empire has ""visited"" and the beautiful items these cultures produce. Almost all of the exhibits are interesting in their unique cultural context; many simply are breath-taking. To experience all of this in a single location; I can hardly think of a better place than the BM. ",Amazing collection of Human History
"May 7, 2019","Went to this Gorgeous Museum on a Friday morning in the month of April, 2019. It was packed, and lots of people on line (remember, entrance is free). Nevertheless, the lines moved quickly and they have special lines for families with children. There is a Map that you can purchase when you enter the facility for 2L. It indicates in a precise way on which levels are the countries collections placed. They have places where you can deposit contributions for keeping it modern, clean, and entrance for free. The collections are so well organized, and so complete, that you just can't believe they have such artifacts, images, preserved mommies and bodies in just one place. You should go first to the Egyptian Site. It is huge and very complete. Then, the collection of stones, tombs and all kinds of crafts built in the ancient world is hard not to remember. In sum, you should plan at least 2 days to spend in this Museum, in order for you to be able to take a glimpse of what they have acquired and preserved for the humanity in all these years. Again, I thank the British Philantrophy for providing such an educational experience to the tourists and their natives for free. You won't regret visiting this historical and well-preserved place.",Great Exhibition
"May 7, 2019","We visited the Edvard Munch love and angst exbibition of prints, including a number of prints of/related to the iconic The Scream.  Well worth a viewing. Catch it before it closes on 21 July 2019.",A must see in London if you love museums
"May 6, 2019","A lot of incredible history.  If you have children, watch Night At The Museum 3 to get inspired.  They have the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles amongst many other collections.  As well as special exhibitions that you can look ahead of time.  We did a scavenger hunt sponsored through an independent organization called THATMuse.  Check it out.  Makes it quite the experience",A special visit for my dad's 70th to one of the greatest world museums
"December 28, 2018","I think this is one of the greatest museums in the world, for four reasons:- the quality of the collections- the architecture of the building itself- the amazing free tours- the fact that entry is free!You could easily spend days in here- or, like I have, discover it over many years. When I first moved to London more than ten years ago and I didn't have much spare cash, one of my favourite treats was to go to this museum and access culture as if I was a king. The best thing I used to do was to go on the free tours, staffed by volunteers- I must have been on about 10 different ones. Every one was fantastic and sometimes there were few other visitors on the tour- I think once there were just three of us. The volunteers are real specialists in their subjects- for example the Egypt specialist could read hieroglyphics- and their passion helps to bring the exhibits alive in a way I can seldom experience just from wandering around on my own.For my Dad's 70th birthday I was taking him on a trip and we were passing through London, so my wife and I brought him here. He loves learning about history so I knew he would enjoy it. We easily got onto a tour (you just turn up at a meeting point in the relevant gallery, you don't need to book) and had a fantastic time.We are so lucky to have this amazing place in our country.",Well Worth a Visit
"December 27, 2018",Absolutely brilliant place to visit with many interesting exhibits to see I would highly recommend.  To see such pivotal Items as the Rosetta stone really made my day I could easily have spent several days looking around instead of the few hours I actually had.,A Trip Through History
"December 21, 2018","The British Museum has so much to see, you have to make choices.  I would advise getting to the museum when it opens and plan on spending as much time as you feel necessary to see all the exhibits you want to see.  The museum visitor's guide is very helpful.  Visiting the British Museum is a trip through history and a ""must see"" when you visit London.",Please give me more!!! 
"December 12, 2018","A difficult place to describe in one post. An eclectic mix of the recent millenia of human history, this museum houses artifacts of almost every civilisation conceivable ('acquired' through various means one might add). It can be quite overwhelming initially and so a guided tour on specific civilisations or on a specific theme is a must. It ties everything together well with a cohesive story that one can follow instead of just roaming by oneself (which in itself is enjoyable depending on your personality). Hours or days can go by but it is exhilarating to learn about where we've been so that we may know where we're going. ",Always something interesting to see
"December 11, 2018","Loved the way the 'I am Ashurbanipal' exhibition brought the reliefs to life, explaining the story they represented.There was a massive queue at the front of the building so we went to the entrance on Montague Place and got in immediately.",Best of the best.  Best!!
"December 11, 2018",This surely has the largest collection of Egyptian artifacts anywhere out of Egypt--fabulous with the Rosetta Stone highlight. Very nice restaurant for lunch.  Great for use of wheelchair for handicapped as I am.  Takes a whole day.,Stuff you saw in your Art History class.
"December 11, 2018","The greatest treasures of the world -- The Egyptians, The Assyrians, The Greeks -- including the sculptures of the Parthenon!",History fun and safe 
"December 10, 2018",There is lots to see. The older kids can wonder round on their own. Take as much time as you need or do multiple visits. It's free but you can make a donation. There is food in the museum. There are lots of resting places. ,One of the best museums in the world
"December 10, 2018","Perhaps one of the world's most complete mounds. The British Museum is one of the largest and probably the most beautiful museums in the world. If one visits it, he can see exhibits from all over the world, from various peoples such as ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Japanese, Chinese, Sumerians, Europeans, Indians, Africans etc.As in most English museums, access is free, and it is worthwhile to visit someone to see past work.Most important of the exhibits are the parts of Parthenon, Karyatida and other ancient Greek statues.",Best museum I  have been to
"December 6, 2018","I thought the Mets in New York was good but the British Museum is still the best. I love the Egyptian, Alsyrian, Greek and Roman section. I could spend the whole day there and not able to finish looking at everything. I manage to spend 2 mornings to cover these sections. I’m sure there are many more things to see.",Always amazing
"November 4, 2018","I've been twice in 6 years and it's only gotten better. It's so easy to get wrapped up in the mummies but there's so much more. Make for at least a few hours. Even outside there's a lot going on with performing artists. The difference between now and 6 years ago...security. You now have to have your bags checked and I'm sure the line early in the day can get quite long, but we went around 3ish on a Friday so the line was shorter. Afterwards, find a small quiet restaurant in the neighbourhood to rest your weary feet.",Museum tour
"November 1, 2018",This was a fascinating 90+ minute tour of the highlights of the museum. Our guide was a wealth of information and amusing at times. He had a great perspective of history and could explain the part the treasures we saw played in the overall progression. Our tour went longer for those who were interested so our guide could show us more. It was wonderful and well worth the fee through the museum!,Not to be missed
"October 30, 2018","The British Museum is a wonder, with so many outstanding treasures.  The Rosetta  Stone is the first treasure that greets you as you enter.  After tha, t one gallery after another will astounded you with their wonders. The Elgin Marbles Room is truly amazing and the marbles are mounted so as to allow a close up view.  The Egyptian mummies are another highlight, as is the Piltdown Man.  There is far to much to see in one visit, but even a small taste is rewarding.",Beautifully Preserved History

"October 27, 2018","Umpteenth visit to the British Museum; it is always interesting and accommodating. On a rainy Sunday in October, bring an umbrella and be prepared for a lengthy queue to enter. The earlier you can get there the better.","If you have time for only one London attraction, this is it."
"October 24, 2018","What can I say except that it is by far the best museum I've visited in my whole life. And I think it bests even the Cairo Museum of Antiquities.Even if you're not particularly turned on by history, the magnificence of the displays (and the way they're displayed and the information given) are spectacular. (Don't miss the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus!)However, don't depend on the free guide they give if you're looking for just the highlights. There are some notable exclusions. Try looking up online or at Frommer's Easy Guide to London for better information on the key exhibits.If you ARE a history buff, half a day may not be enough. What you can do is to allocate the whole day. They have a sizeable cafe in the museum where you can get fed. Don't expect gourmet food though. Of course, you could bring your own food and eat in the cafe area.Do not miss this. The queue can get pretty long. We were there near the opening time but there were lots of people already there. However, we were in within 15 minutes. The Brits are masters at crowd management. (Something I can't say for Eiffel Tower)",It’s that time of the year!!!

Wherever you go there in every rooms you find something interesting. From young to old. Every generation can find their interest their . This museum is ready for families as well. When we were hungry we could eat downstairs where we bought sandwiches and drink . I really offer to everyone to visit it not once minimum twice .,Wished we had more time

"November 1, 2018",This was a fascinating 90+ minute tour of the highlights of the museum. Our guide was a wealth of information and amusing at times. He had a great perspective of history and could explain the part the treasures we saw played in the overall progression. Our tour went longer for those who were interested so our guide could show us more. It was wonderful and well worth the fee through the museum!,Not to be missed
"October 30, 2018","The British Museum is a wonder, with so many outstanding treasures.  The Rosetta  Stone is the first treasure that greets you as you enter.  After tha, t one gallery after another will astounded you with their wonders. The Elgin Marbles Room is truly amazing and the marbles are mounted so as to allow a close up view.  The Egyptian mummies are another highlight, as is the Piltdown Man.  There is far to much to see in one visit, but even a small taste is rewarding.","Great Place to visit, Free exhibition!"
"August 27, 2018","Great place to visit and explore the Egypt exhibition, seen the Rosetta Stone and plenty of mummies including one of the cleopatra’s ",MUST visit
"August 27, 2018","Breath in, breath out; be ready for CROWDS, at least right now in the summer season.  If you approach your visit calmly and with an understanding that you will be one among many, it is a wonderful place.  My family (12 year old included) spent HOURS here and merely scratched the surface of what it has to offer.  The Rosetta Stone is a highlight and there is something for everyone.  We ate in the Grand Court and the food was just fine; fulfilling sandwiches, yummy puddings.  I would plan (at least now in peak season) 4 hours for a visit.",Great!
"August 26, 2018","What an experience! The Library holds one of 3 existing Magna Cartas, musical scores by Handel, Haydn and Beethoven, and much more. Very exciting place for those who love history.",Too much to see for one visit
"August 26, 2018",this museum is one you will want to visit many time.  Their exhibits are set out well and there are usually special exhibits.,"Amazing museum.. plan to do visit over two days, so much to see!"
"August 23, 2018","The Egyptian and Roman sections are amazing... especially the mummies and of course, Cleopatra... the summer can be tough because there is no air conditioning so go early in the day. ",What culture
"August 22, 2018",First of all free entrance is a signal of culture. Then the museum is friendly also for someone doesn’t buy guide and don’t speak English very well. The stele di Rosetta is amazing.,One of best museums in world
"August 20, 2018","It's free. Its huge. Watch going during peaks times,  it can get extremely busy. Egyptian, Greek and Roman exhibits are fantastic.",Must See London Landmark
"August 17, 2018","Whenever I go to London I try to get by the British Museum.  Their collections are amazing and their presentation allows you to get very close to be able to see the amazing abilities of the ancients.  Of course the Rosetta Stone is there.  I am a Christian and I especially enjoy seeing the artifacts which demonstrate the unique accuracy of the Bible (e.g., Taylor Prism, Cyrus Cylinder, Lachish Ostrica and many other items).  They have great tour books for all interests and very interesting temporary exhibits.  It also has an adequate café to be able to refuel before taking on more of London.  It is just a short walk from the Tottenham Court Road tube stop.",A Must if you're in London
"August 14, 2018","Although free of charge, this attraction alone is worth a trip to London. The museum is grand and there is so much to see. The shops sell books, etc and there is a cafe plus a more posh restaurant located on the upper storey. Unfortunately the Japan exhibit was closed but there was so much else to see that it didn't I didn't feel I missed out. ",Amazing museum
"August 13, 2018","British Museum is a place to visit because of the great and amazing variety of pieces. Organization is good but the division of the age and the objects is a bit confusionary. The structure is stunning, it needs 2 days to visit. Too many people, may be because of the free entrance...","Amazing treasures, fantastic architecture"
"July 20, 2018","Go into the British Museum just for the amazing interior architecture if nothing else. But the Greek, Assyrian, Egyptian artifacts are fantastic.",Fantastic exhibits 
"July 19, 2018",It is truly amazing to see in real lifevthebitemsvyou have only read about. Free access to museum is truly a great thing. We participated in a free your in ancient Egypt. Love the place and want to come back,Such a treasure trove!
"July 19, 2018","While in principle I disagree with the looting of other nations by the British, whenever I visit this place I tend to have second thoughts. They have done such a wonderful job of preservation that in some cases the items in question are probably better preserved & displayed here. In recent decades, there is also acknowledgment of the way some items were acquired. All in all, this Museum alone needs at least 3 whole days if not more. ",Toilet provision a disgrace
"July 18, 2018","I am ashamed as a man and a Londoner to see women queuing for ages to use a loo in our wonderful British Museum. In this day and age!! And, yes, I have written and complained to the organisation and never even received a reply. Perhaps this is elicit a response???",Not sure if summer is the best time to visit
"July 18, 2018","It is one of the best museums you can visit in your lifetime. However, there are some things that you should know before you go. First, not so long time ago, the security of the place was no so complicated. Now you have to pass a security scrutiny. 2. The place does not have a proper air-conditioning, thus summer at 30 degrees surrounded by hordes of tourist might be overwhelming. The place was so packed when I went that I barely could see anything in some of the rooms. If you moved upstairs, the museum is less packed but the heat is more intense. I will only recommend to visit the British Museum in summer if this is your first visit to London and you do not expect to go in the near future. Try to avoid the weekends and if the temperature outside is above the 30 degrees forget it; the heat will be so unbearable that you will be counting the seconds to get out.  Instead go to the Victoria & Albert or other museums less crowded.",Obligatory. 
"July 17, 2018","Great. Just that. Great. Gave our five year old great insight into ancient Egypt and Rome. Choose what to see, take your time and be sure to grab a bite in the cafe. ",Must do
"July 15, 2018","I don’t think I’ve been to London without including a visit to the British Museum. The exhibits don’t change much but there are just so many interesting artifacts to see to resist. The beauty of the museum is that with free admission, we feel we can drop in for an hour or two as our schedule allows. We don’t feel compelled to see all of it each time we visit. Our last hotel was in Leicester Square and we preferred to walk to the museum in the evening as opposed to taking a taxi or the tube. There is just so much to take-in along the way.",Lots to see
"July 15, 2018","Busy museum with lots to see. I liked the Egyptian artefacts the best, worth visiting. There is also a nice restaurant to eat in the museum.","Free, epic!"
"July 13, 2018","Why are you reading this? Head over here immediately! Only negatives are they do ask for donations even though they have boxes within, but you should if you’ve enjoyed it.","huge - even with the crowds, it was incredible"
"July 12, 2018","We arrived early and got the audio guides.  I would recommend them.  The museum is massive, and if you are like me and like to read the descriptions, you could not possibly cover the entire museum in one day.   The audio guides are flexible enough to accommodate different interests, with different suggested tours.  Alternatively, you could just wander, but I recommend following one of the audio 'tours'.  This is a great museum. Don't miss it. ",Everything Under One Roof
"March 23, 2018","I was amazed they had so many cultures, so many time periods, and so many rooms! Massive! You really could stay here all day if you had nothing to do, and just wanted to take it all in. It was cool to watch the Black Panther and say ""I've been there!""",The security is poorly designed it makes you dizzy
"March 18, 2018",The security is poorly designed it makes you dizzy. Why on Earth you have to walk in a zig zag when entering this museum. I purely understand the concept of having a security for the health and safety of individuals but entering in a zigzag way makes you dizzy and will left you ha r no more energy of walking around in the museum. ,Wonderful collection 
"March 14, 2018","Beautiful atrium, nice shop. Wonderful and huge collection to view. I found the museum a bit challenging to navigate-it seems there are rooms and floors that are hidden away or require you to go quite a way to get to the stairs/lift or restrooms ",Dry and blabd
"March 12, 2018","It took me longer to zig zag through there security fences on entering than it did to look around. The person on the info desk appeared put out by the fact I was asking for suggestions, maybe this is what aided me in losing interest, but I just didn’t feel captivated by the artefacts or appreciate their historical significance.",Nice place to spend a wintery day....
"March 11, 2018","You must visit this Museum while in London.  There is so much to explore - Irish, Greek...the world.  It is vast = though there were a lot of people, it wasn't crowded.  The cafe in the museum is lovely as well.  What's really great it is free but if you can, take the time and see the pay displays, they are worth it.",So much to do
"March 11, 2018","Our 7 year old had just watched Night At The Museum 1,2&3 and was desperate to go to the British Museum. She also enjoys this sort of thing normally too so that was just an added bonus. Oh my goodness soooooo much to see and do. We queued at the cloakroom to check in our bag and jackets as we did not want to lug them around all day. We worked out this would have cost us £11 but as we got to the front the lady kindly informed us as we were a family we could use the family room downstairs for a £1 which is returned to to us  at the end! Bonus!! Took luggage there and you get a great big locker plus there are toilets - so no queuing upstairs! We went to the family desk to pick up a tour and a map and we were off, I’m pretty certain we dint see everything and will need to return in the future but what we did see was very well presented and laid out, daughter loved the Egyptian part, plus Easter Island with “DumDum”. Very interesting seeing all of the Roman finds as most seem to be from around Norfolk (home). There were lots of different areas that she had been learning about at school and got to see a lot of pieces and attic acts to support these so definitely great to see. We didn’t take lunch so bought some in the cafe in the main area - although it was quite pricey, it was very tasty, and different, not your big standard cheese or ham sandwich. Salads were tasty. Although next time I would take our own - lots of people did. We spent over 5 hours here and probably could have spent 5 more! Definitely worth a visit - and it’s free so why wouldn’t you! ",Nice learning journey for the children
"March 11, 2018",Visited during the last Dec 2017 school holidays. Huge collection especially the Egyptians sections. So awesome & nice to see the real mummy for the 1st time. ,"Weekends are a madhouse, but you have to go"
"March 4, 2018","So much stuff, so little time.  For the Elgin marbles from the Parthenon alone, this place is a must see.  There is also an amazing display of Egyptian art and artefacts, including so many mummies it will make your head spin.  The Babylonian area is without peer...truly extraordinary.  The covered courtyard itself is worth seeing...truly and architectural masterpiece.  That said, its crumbling and dirty in the corners, and the crowds are truly obnoxious on the weekends, especially if the weather is poor.  And, the ""Asian"" areas give such embarassing short shrift to countless cultures with a weird display of random artifacts in what looks like your grandmother's bookcases.  Strange.  Nevertheless, you must go.",Best museum in London 
"March 3, 2018","Must see for great British and Egyptian history. The exhibits are not interactive though, so it was a little difficult entertaining our toddler and keeping him off the artwork and artifacts. ",Amazing
"March 1, 2018","This was one of the best museums I’ve ever been to! I’ve traveled to some of the most popular museums in the world and this makes my top 3. The ancient Egypt section is great! One of the largest out there. The classical sections for Rome and Greece are very extensive. Entrance is free, loads of shops and a restaurant too. You can truly make a day of it here either solo or with the family.  ",Amazing place with no entry free

"February 23, 2018","The British Museum is a massive and fabulous place to visit with a wide range of exhibits from across the globe. I didn't manage to see every section of the museum, however, I did see quite a bit within a couple of hours. They have a few Egyptian mummies on display, anglo saxon artefacts and everything in between. They also have a very good Asian collection as well as a few great exhibits from Australia and New Zealand. The cafe was packed, so if you want to eat I recommend eating at a nearby cafe/restaurant or bring your own food. ",Spectacular museum
"February 21, 2018","This is a must-go-to place that I have been telling all my friends about. Been there now 3 times and still learn more and more.

Having passed by a few times I could notice long lines to wait to go through security in order to enter the museum.I notice that there is separate ""fast lane"".

"September 24, 2017","It was a wonderful museum if you are into antiquities!  The Rosetta Stone was so awesome to see as the Elgin Marbles.  There is no fee, just a fee for the headsets!  They were worth it.  It was a sunny day so we ate on the plaza outside for lunch.",The Colonial Museum
"September 18, 2017","I heard that the British museum was a great place to visit for all types of history. So why not visit if in the neighbourhood? It is free after all. Well I enjoy history and not just looking at a catalogue of historical artefacts. So what was the issue with the museum? 1. There's no narrative. Just random items plonked in rooms with no real story. Sarcophago dotted about then a room with Assyrian artefacts again just dotted randomly. No context. 2. The narrative that is supplied is one that I believe many people are no longer interested in. Items had under them a homage to the person who ""discovered"" the item and a blurb about them, then an smaller description of the item. I really could not give a monkeys about which colonialist stole this item for the state. It really isn't important unless the item itself isn't important but merely the acquisition of it. If that's the case, then as I say in the title, change the name of the museum! 3. Plenty of merchandising and sponsorships in your face. Yes the museum needs to fund itself but it's a bit OTT.4. Stuffy. Wanted to leave earlier than planned. I could rant about other things about the museum but I'm wasting my typing breath. ",This place is awesome.!
"September 16, 2017","For a history buff there is not better place to visit.  If there was problem with the British Museum it is there is more things to see than you can look at in a day, and the crowds make this problematic.  Get there first thing in the morning.",A must

Very sad to read its collections were moved back to the big, imposing BM building and most of its collection are now no longer displayed :-( . 6 Burlington Garden, the building MoM was house in near Burlington Arcade  (another place I enjoy just strolling through) is really beautiful.

"November 17, 2017","We used the Rick Steves guide book to take a tour through the British Museum.  Also, the tour can be downloaded and listened to as you walk through the museum - excellent source of information and Rick makes history come alive.  We try to have a  flexible schedule in London.  You can never count on the weather, so when it’s raining we tour the museums, when it’s nice we take the walking tours.  Also, try to have a plan for meal time.  Look up restaurants in the area you will be in ahead of time, not when you’re starving.  Or if it’s nice, pick a park or a bench overlooking the Thames and have a picnic.",A Must
"November 16, 2017","When going to London this museum is a must. The collections there were from all over the world. You can see a lot in just one place. The day we went, it was only a short queue to have our bags checked. After one of the staff pointed us to another counter, I had no idea what that was for. The guy at the counter asked me for a donation.  I know I have to give donation but not in this way, I felt like I was forced to donate. At the time I didn’t have anything smaller then £50, so I just emptied my change purse.  When I finished exploring the museum, at the exit I gave more donations (in Canadian currency) of my own free will. Be prepared to donate to this museum, it is worthy.

"November 8, 2017","There was a line for bag check to enter the museum; that moved quickly.  While entrance to the museum is free, there was a charge to enter the special Scythian Gold exhibit, but it was well worth it-- such amazing revelations about the lives of this Siberian nomadic people.",My favourite museum ever
"November 7, 2017","This museum is legendary: it hosts incredible pieces from all around the world, such as from Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, Aztec art, and countless more. There are always modern expositions as well and the souvenirs are wonderful too. I adore this place and hope you will too.Some of the perks are that there is no entry fee, although donations are appreciated (and deserved!), the area around it is nice, and the access to wordly treasures is incomparable in my opinion. The only downside I can think of is the tightened security these days because there is a queue--nor can you excitedly run up the stairs of this beautiful building. Some of the rooms get crowded in peek holiday season, but the queue to enter the museum moves fast.I (lived and) have family in the UK so I have been to London many times--and I visit this museum every during each visit (perhaps 20 times). I consider myself to be a bit of an art and history geek, so I even prefer to visit museums by myself, unless accompanied by somebody even more into it.",An very imposing building
"November 3, 2017","This is one of many beautiful buildings in London. It is free but understandably visitors are asked for a voluntary contribution towards costs. There is the usual bag search before you get into the museum which is conducted efficiently and by friendly staff.  The museum contains many treasures and it is best to plan what you want to see and not ‘over do’ it.  Today, I went to the section on the Americas - incredible. The museum is clean and well staffed by very helpful people. There are the usual food outlets and gift shops. This museum is very worth a visit. ",free but worthy

"July 10, 2017","This was my third visit to the British Museum. On previous visits I had spent most of my time in ancient civilizations: Greece, Rome, and Egypt. Those collections are some of the best in the world and well worth the majority of my time spent on two previous visits. The Rosetta Stone is also worth a visit of its own. This visit, though, I managed to move on to other displays including Britain from 800 BC through Medieval Europe which occupied a good four hours reading display descriptions and viewing artifacts.A few pointers: Admission is free. If you are on a budget, you may want to print out a map ahead of time, although you can pick up a free map, with limited descriptions, inside the Great Court. Guide books and more detailed maps are for sale.The Great Court restaurants can get very busy. There is a pizzeria is the southwest corner (through room 12: Greece 1050-520 BC) that may be less hectic should you opt for dining within the museum.",Excellent!
"July 7, 2017","This is a must see museum if you are visiting London, it has an amazing wealth of items that would interest even people who don't normally like museums. The place looks fabulous. The only downside is that there are a lot of people there, since the tour buses bring tourist there pretty much daily. So you really want to get there a few minutes before they open. I love that their brochure highlights all the must see items/exhibits and gives their exact location within the museum, so if you only have an hour or two to spend there you will see the most important things if you follow their suggestions.

"July 5, 2017","The museum is free to visit, but that does not mean there is not an astonishing amount of things to see inside. Unfortunately I was in a bit of a time crunch and only had two hours to look around, but you certainly can spend an entire day here and still not see it all. It contains a wealth of artifacts, history, and information, and for me it was a very humbling experience to see it all. ",Great family outing!
"July 4, 2017",Wonderful collection of artifacts - kids and adults loved the visit!  The free entry is also much appreciated.,Pleasant surprise with teens
"July 3, 2017","Museum is a nasty word in our family except to me the Mom, but I require each kid choose a museum to visit , every major city we see when we travel so.... one of our kids chose The British Museum. I got the usual as we walked up ""How long so we have to stay? Do we have to do a tour?"" Etc etc. To my great surprise, they found this family interactive audio tour/ game and before I knew it, it was 2 hours later and the museum was closing and they wanted to stay longer! Shocked! We are going back. Very happy. The Greek exhibit is excellent-- especially since we have seen the other half at the Acropolis museum in Athens and they tell a different story about how all the remains ended up in London! Definitely worth a trip with teens, get the family game guide. I thought our 15 year old twins might be too old for it but were not. Since it's free, going twice is not a bad idea if you have the time OR visit for an hour or 2 in morning, go to lunch around the area, then wonder back. ",Wow!
"June 29, 2017","Absolutely loved this museum! Could have spent multiple days here! We only spent about a half day at the museum as we had many other things on our list to see in London. The exhibits are very well done. We explored the Roman and Egyptian sections and were floored by the beauty of the exhibits. The Parthenon and mummies were my favorite. Can't get over the fact that this museum is free of charge! Just a slight wait to get through security and you are in a world of wonder. Easy to get to. Walking distance from the tube station. Highly recommended! Didn't really notice if there was air conditioning or not. It seemed warm inside and we visited on a cool day so dress accordingly, but an absolute must see!",Always amazing

"August 1, 2017","We didn't have a ton of time so we did the highlights tour.  It was perfect.  Only $12 per person and it was a manageable group size (maybe 10-15 people).  It was easy to keep up at ask questions.  We got to see all the ""must sees"" and some other interesting things as well.  The guide was very informative.  We definitely got more out of the museum than if we'd been on our own.  An excellent choice for people who don't have all day to spend at the museum!",For kids: Egypt and Middle East sections
"July 26, 2017","You would probably need several weeks to really see what the museum has to offer, but if you're traveling with kids (ours are 7 and 12), the Egypt and Middle East sections will keep their attention. We saw the two exhibits, along with the mummies upstairs, and a few other things in about an hour. The history is really gripping, and the artworks are stunning, especially for being so many thousands of years old. ","Great Wave,Great Rip Off"
"July 25, 2017","Access via timed tickets,however it appears that museum members can attend any time without booking,fair enough but they also brought several extra friends with them on the same ticket.Once inside  there was a totally static  crocodile,with back packs swinging.The room was totally overcrowded and it was difficult to stand back and admire the splendid works.",Busy spot but great art

Many amazing works of art and it was FREE! Do not skip this museum on your trip to London.",BUCKET LIST MUST!!!  See over & over & over!
"July 24, 2017",Truly a Bucket List place!!!! Wonderful in every way. I could live here in the museum ....and probably would have to just to see everything in one lifetime!! Before you leave do some research and find out what you can't live without seeing. Then study a map of the museum to know just where to go so you don't waste your valuable time here. I promise you will want to come back over and over and over again!!!,So much to see!
"July 20, 2017","You could really spend days at this museum and not see all the wonderful collections! It has a striking inner courtyard that in and of itself requires walking around to admire. Best of all it's free.We went between 11:30-noon and didn't find a long security line at all. There were sometimes several large tour groups that infiltrate the space you'd like to be in, such as around the popular Rosetta Stone (this exhibit is very cool btw!). You have to patiently wait a bit to see it up close.We spent €5 each to get an audio guide that you can punch in the exhibit number and get a brief explanation. And we used Rick Steve's Pocket London guidebook to point out the more interesting artwork in Egypt, Greece and Assyria. His ""tour"" took about 2.5-3 hours, which is about all my kids (ages 13 and 9) could bear in a big museum like this, so we'll have to go back someday!",ancient
"July 18, 2017","A very ancient and astonishing place we were really amazed by the beauty and magnificence. There are free guided tours of each section at specific times throughout the day, which are detailed in the map. Also  from the top down, and they had historical elements and artefacts of almost every country, from Japan at the top right down to Africa and Ancient Egypt at the bottom. Greek, British, Irish, Roman, American...basically ancient history and how people use to live all in one. I really liked the history of money and how it came about from trading blocks of gold to Apple pay and card these days, the pharmaceutical industry impact, and also the sections on time and clocks as well as writing styles from around the world, like hieroglyphics etc. The Egyptian section was amazing; huge sphinx, stone carvings of Pharaoh's, mummification and the Rosetta stone. There is so much in the museum that you could easily spend a couple of hours if not the whole day. ",On of the best.
"July 11, 2017","Best museum in London and it is free.  Can be crowded at times but lots to see.  Rosetta stone, Elgin marbles etc.",Tour London Walks
"July 10, 2017","Terrible tour guide for London Walks. Took much too long to get organized, collect funds and start the tour. Very eccentric guide that took 20 minutes to explain something that should have taken two. After 1 1/2 hours, we had only seen two things in the museum.",simply great
"October 17, 2017","an awesome, impressive museum at all. The objects are lovingly presented and well documented. I recommend to spend the money for the audio guide. This guide is the best I ever had in an exhibition - especially for children who are not english native (available in many languages). ",Autism freindly
"October 15, 2017",Our school took a group of autistic children to complete a topic of the greeks. Amazing treatment great museum staff totally got the childrens needs and were very helpful had an area set out for us.Thank you,Visiting
"October 12, 2017","Our visit was the part of our last day in London. Security was fast and easy, they had the Greek gallery closed but the Sirian exhibition was unreal.",So Iconic - so free of charge. What is not to like?
"October 10, 2017","The British Museum is just wall-to-wall icons. The Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles, mummies galore, phenomenal collections from Greek and Roman antiquity, on and on and on...the Museum offers excellent half-hour ""eye-opener"" tours of selected aspects of their vast collections - well worth tagging along. These are not tours led by bored, pimply-faced adolescents who got a summer job at the museum courtesy of mummy and daddy. the leaders are experts in their fields, and they provide a fantastic level of information. The museum itself is easy to navigate, and because it is free to go there, you don't have to feel like you must see it all in one day There is an excellent cafe in the new atrium, and a reasonably good (although not stellar) gift shop. There is really no point going on about this place - its reputation precedes it. But everything you have heard is true.","So much to browse through, and so little time!"
"October 10, 2017","Half an afternoon was not enough, and unfortunately the guided tour had been booked out already. The audio guides were quite useful. ",Rosetta Stone and High Tea
"October 8, 2017",The Rosetta Stone is the reason we visited this museum.  Fascinating to see up close.  We also enjoyed high tea in the cafe.  Recommend you have a reservation.  It was very tasty and inexpensive.  ,Amazing art for free
"October 7, 2017",I can't believe this is for free. The museum has amazing pieces of art from all corners of the word. Beautiful building. ,Great Museum
"October 4, 2017",One of the tops museums in London. Check out the amazing mummies and the Rosetta Stone. You could spend tons of time here but it’s also worth it for a quick run-through if you’re short on time.  ,A breif visit
"October 2, 2017",A fantastic museum to visit. The collection is so extensive that you can't see all in one visit. Can't imagine it is free!,A visit to kill a few hours
"October 2, 2017","We had a few hours to kill and this did the job very well indeed.  There's no need to go on about the all the stunning exhibits, other than to say that they are stunning.  Well worth a visit.  Oh, and the cafe facility was also very good - particularly in the cake department although I am surprised that these we laid out for folk to cough and sneeze over!",A Glorious Center of Art and Architecture
"April 14, 2017",Rooms full of artifacts and art from all civilizations in the world.  Cafes and shops to accommodate your visit. Make sure you plan to spend a whole day because there is so much to see.,Must See
"April 13, 2017",The Rosetta Stone is amazing! Every person on Earth should see it. The ancient Egyptian art is truly worth a visit to the British Museum and London.,Worth the visit if interested in history
"April 8, 2017","It free, its a wonderful building and contains amazing history.I have always had an interest in Egypt and its history and the British museum has a lot of things to seeThe Rosetta stone is well worth the vist",Amazing!
"March 29, 2017","The  best attractions in London, so many great works, even the Rosetta stone is there! Simply a must-see",Excellent museum in London 
"March 28, 2017",Free entrance. Map for 2 pounds. Audio guide for 6 pounds. One of the best audio guides ever tested. I dedicated almost two hours on Egypt mummies and Greek sculptures. The museum is huge and almost infinite. Rosetta Stone is remarkable. ,Huge and Awesome
"March 27, 2017","London's museums are free of charge to enter.  That by itself is just amazing.  The British Museum did not disappoint.  The Rosetta Stone is the piece everyone knows, but the museum is full of so many other artifacts, artwork, and historical elements.  The staff is not pretentious and are willing to explain or educate if you ask questions.  We did not feel rushed or crowded.  This is a world class museum you should not miss during your trip to wonderful London!",All the World in one museum
"March 20, 2017",This is a must-see every time I'm in London. I think you could visit 100 times and not see it all. The original Rosetta stone is worth a look and the much-disputed Elgin (Acropolis) marbles have to be seen.,Wow!
"March 18, 2017","There is so much to see at this Museum that it can be intimidating. But, get a map, have a tea or coffee break and plan your visit.  I was with a friend and we went our own directions. Concentrate on the areas you like..there is no way to see it all. Just savor what you love...for me it was the Elgin marbles and Egyptian rooms.",Great fun!
"March 17, 2017",We have gone several times and we can't get enough.  We visit London two times a year and every time visit this museum.  Always great exhibits and never enough time to see it all.  So we keep going back.,Leading Global History Museum
"March 13, 2017","Aesthetically really interesting. Great long-term Egyptian exhibit with a lot of really nice travelling exhibits. Lots of great free exhibits from around the world - Iran, US, SE Asia, Ancient History, etc.",Impressive
"January 9, 2017",The whole complex is just breathtaking and the stuff is very friendly and efficient!The Bistro is very recommendable!,Amazing place 
"January 8, 2017",Could have spend a week here but unfortunately wasn't very interesting for my wife.  Make sure you go alone or with someone who appreciates history.Would I recommend....YES Would I return .... YES,Prepare for the crowds
"January 6, 2017","How can you go to London without a stop at the British Museum? Especially  since many of the countries where it's treasures were ""discovered"" have asked for their return. Given our schedule, it was impossible to go anytime but the late afternoon, when it was the most crowded. But I was determined to see the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles, etc. I appreciated the fact that entry was free, and it has delightful gift shops, although it was lacking in sufficient bathrooms. Due to the crowds we only stayed for two hours, but it was exhilarating to see things you have read about.",Worth visiting
"January 2, 2017","The museum is huge, there is so much to see - you will need at least half a day if you want to see a few of the exhibits.  The architecture of the museum is beautiful.","One of the most important museums in the world, a must!"
"January 1, 2017",This museum has collections of every continent and is a must. Try to be early (10 am) and be ready to walk at least 4 hours. I recommend audio guide for knowing more about selected items.,An absolute must see
"December 31, 2016","This is a fantastic museum that deserves at least a day's visit--even then, don't think you can see it all.  This a place you could go back to again and again and not see the same exhibit twice.  We went through the Egyptian, Assyrian, Roman-Greco and British Isle exhibits and were not disappointed.  The Assyrian exhibit was stunning--I almost cried when I went past the sphinxes--it was thrilling to see them.  Equally fascinating were the ""hoard"" exhibits in the British Isles exhibits--look them up, you will be astonished at the craftsmanship of these early peoples.  The exhibits are well laid out with good signage.  Our family did not include any young children, so we can't speak to how they might enjoy the museum but there were a lot of children there the day we went and they seemed to be enjoying the exhibits.  ",Very good
"December 31, 2016","A wonder of the world. Must be seen. It is quite tirying if you want to visit it all, but it is a phantastic experience. ",Easy to spend a whole day here
"December 21, 2016","I'm a huge museum fan and history buff, and I spent my whole day here from open to close. Admission is free, but I chose to rent an audioguide (they offer discounts for students) and I found that really enhanced my visit. The guide offers different tour options, so if you're looking to only spend an hour or two here before moving on, the guide will direct you to the museum's highlights (including the Rosetta Stone and statues from the Parthenon!).",Amazing resource
"December 15, 2016","Summary based on many visits:--amazing resource, extremely strong in some areas--free (donation requested)--some popular exhibits can be so crowded as to be unviewable--camera phones have transformed the experience to something like a rugby scrum--less visited areas are quite goodNow has a preliminary bag check in a sheltered tent, but no big deal. Lighting after sunset in the Great Court isn't very good.Selfie sticks and visitors without a clue are a threat.",Nice
"December 7, 2016","Nice just expected it to be more interesting and the infrastructure was little bit difficult, so we had been going circles.",Must See
"October 4, 2016","The British Museum was on the top of our must see list in London, and after visiting, can say it was wonderful. One could literally spend hours here, and still not see everything, so we decided to focus on what we really wanted to see to ensure our visit was a quality one. Definitely add this to the list of must see in London! ",Simply Over-Crowded; Exhibits Poorly Set Up
"October 4, 2016","I have given up on the British Museum.  It's always jammed; the special exhibits aren't arranged to facilitate good flow of people, so it's impossible to see what's on display - it's like being on the Underground at rush hour.  Really - why bother?",Enjoying the British Museum
"October 3, 2016","Spent a wonderful day in the British Museum.  Amazing collection, especially in ancient artifacts, including the Rosetta Stone  Nice places to stop for a bite to eat, and accessible and well-stocked gift shops.  We got there right when it opened on a Sunday and it got very crowded very fast.  Check on the collection and go to the areas that interest you first.",Great experience
"September 27, 2016","We walked from our hotel and timed our arrival to coincide with the museum opening to beat any crowds. As soon as I entered the building I new o was in for a treat. The ""Lobby"" for lack of a better word was already stunning. The scope of artifacts on display was astounding. Egyptian exhibits was jaw dropping. It's easy to navigate and best of all, it's free. A great way to spend a little or a lot of time depending on what you want to get out of your visit. Anyone with any interest in what the museum has to offer should definitely invest some time and have a look. ",A day of history
"September 24, 2016",We got there as the doors opened and spent most of the day wandering around this great museum. If you like to read all information supplied. Give yourself the whole day in enjoy. ,A must see in London
"September 22, 2016",So much to see and it's all fantastic.  I'm a history nut & i could have spent the entire day looking at all of the exhibits.  I especially love the Egyptian & Roman exhibits.,Everything from Rosetta stone to Vikings
"September 17, 2016",You could spend days here exploring all the exhibits. The middle part is very spacious and gives a good feeling.,Mesmerizing and Everything I thought it Would Be
"September 14, 2016","Having always been interested in Ancient Egyptian history, the British Museum was definitely a place I wanted to see. I easily spent hours here, wandering through the exhibits. Go early if you can to beat the large amounts of tourists, especially if you want to get up close to the Rosetta Stone. ",Amazing ancient treasures in the middle of town
"September 13, 2016","This museum is worth making time for. It is one of the many treasures London has to offer and let's you travel to far away places while remaining in the center of this vibrant city. When we see what is happening to some of the historical treasures of Iraq and Syria, it makes us appreciate even more those forward thinkers who made a move to protect architectural treasures in times of destruction, and preserve them here, for us all to enjoy. I will never look at the trim on a building the same way again...",A must stop
"September 12, 2016","I go here everytime and I'm always amazed. Do yourself a favor and pick up the audio tour when you arrive. It makes a huge difference, but talk about a trip around the world in one building. ",Lives up to its reputation.
"September 2, 2016","Always wanted to see the Rosetta Stone.  So many great things to see.  Well done.  So many sources of info on this, it hardly needs anything added from me.",Free! 
"September 2, 2016",You'd be mad not to take advantage of this free national resource. So much to see. And see close up. You could spend hours in there or even days. ,Rosetta Stone
"September 2, 2016","I went with 1 main purpose to see the Rosetta Stone it was awesome, had a look at the Ancient Egyptian rooms they were spectacular with mummies & cartouches & burial items. The antiques rooms were full of artifacts from around the world, there was an antechamber just for South American stuff. In all an exceptional place to visit",Fantastic collection
"September 1, 2016","British Museum, similar to other large museums, is not a landmark fully appreciated on a single visit.  If you come to terms with this reality, your visits to this museum will be better planned and more enjoyable.  I tend to use British Museum as a transitional destination on each trip to London.  I allot a part of a day and as such plan to see a smaller subset of this collection.  This way, I am driven mad by the volume of artifacts and the urge to try to see everything.  You will see people who think they can absorb thousands of years of human civilization at one visit.  They are rushed and tired and panicked.  Instead, take your time and stroll through one or two galleries.  Read the legends and try to understand the time frame and the geography.  That way you may actually take something away for life from your visit.  ",Sunken Cities: Egypt's Lost Worlds
"August 27, 2016","The British Museum defies review...so this is merely the review of the temporary exhibition  ""Sunken Cities: Egypt's Lost Worlds"" which is on until the 27th of November 2016. The show is about two cities on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt, east of Alexandria, which flourished in Ptolemaic times and gradually sank until they were submerged deeply and forgotten about for centuries. They were discovered in the middle of the last century, and systematically explored by underwater archeologists who contributed their chief findings to this superb exhibition. I was astonished at the scale of finds (monumental statuary)  as well the nature of finds. Since these are not ancient cities by Egyptian standards, and heavily influenced by the Greek culture of the Ptolemies, I was not expecting much in the way of new insights. I was totally mistaken. Many of the monumental works follow the traditions of Egyptian art closely, showing how thoroughly the Ptolemies ""went native"", pretending to be traditional pharaohs. On the other hand, many of the finds show the multi-culturality which was so striking about Alexandria. The artifacts not only show how Greek and Egyptian gods were revered side-by-side, but that new, syncretistic gods and cults emerged and became big, like Serapis, who was worshiped in major temples in these cities. The part of the exhibition about the ""Mysteries of Osiris"" ( as in the ""death and resurrection of"")  is particularly enlightening.I would recommend listening to the audio guide which is excellent in explaining all these aspects.",A history lesson for free!
"August 25, 2016",One of the most wonderful things about London is that almost all the museums are free to visit! The British Museum is my favourite one! The hall is a show of its own and my favourite room is the mummies where you can really feel the energy from all the history!,Food for the brain
"August 24, 2016",Don't forget to visit the British Museum if you have a few hours to spare....your brain will thank you for it!! I went and saw some sketches of Sicily on the top floor and then met some friends to visit the Mediterranean civilisation rooms. All in all an excellent and inspiring visit. ,The World's Best Museum?
"August 23, 2016","Certainly one of the world's great museums, and free!The exhibits and exhibitions are brilliantly curated and the wealth and range of historical and pre-historical artefacts are phenomenal. ",Wonderful place you could never get bored here
"August 10, 2016","What a wonderful place to walk around and look at everything that is on view. You could happily spend many hours walking aroung and I don't think you could ever get bored. So much to see, what an experience ",One of the most comprehensive museums in the world.
"August 9, 2016","The British Museum has one of the best collections of any museums in the world.  It includes objects from nearly all major civilisations.  As a result there is a lot to see and not all can be seen in a single visit.Enter via Great Russell Street or from the back from Montague Place and head towards the Great Court in the centre of the building. From here you can access galleries on four sides or head upstairs to the galleries there.  One of the best known objects in the museum is the Rosetta Stone and can be found just off the West exit from the Great Court.  Further on from this is the Duveen gallery which displays the Parthenon Sculptures.  The frieze occupies most of the space and is the best preserved of the sculptures.  Large Egyptian sculptures occupy the gallery that you enter immediately off the west side of the Great Court.  The Egyptian collection continues on the first floor north wing with artefacts from the Pre-Dynastic period up to the Coptic period.  On the first floor collection are wonderful frescos from the Tomb of Nebamun.  It also has burials and Nubian objects.The Classical section not only includes the Parthenon sculptures but elements from two of the seven wonders of the Ancient World; the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus and the Temple of Artemis.  Beginning with Cycladic art, it continues through Minoan, Classical up to Roman Britain on the first floor.  The objects from Roman Britain include early Christian mosaics.  It further includes Cypriot and Etruscan objects.A highlight of the collection is the Assyrian palace reliefs.  These are extensive and display a variety of scenes.  Long corridors and rooms are dedicated to the reliefs displaying hunting, war and blessings to give a better idea of an Assyrian palace.The museum holds a small but very good selection of Aztec artefacts.  One side gallery displays a large collection of Chinese jades.Their collection of 2 million prints and drawings are displayed on a rotational basis by artist or theme, e.g. witches or Spanish drawings.  A staircase from the print gallery brings you up to the Japanese gallery.  This gallery is wood lined and subtly lit and this presents the objects perfectly.There is a café in the Great Court but this can get busy.  Alternatively, you can go to the café in the South West of the building, which is usually quieter.It is opened daily with late openings on Fridays.  Entrance is free with special exhibitions having a charge.",Traditional museum
"September 12, 2016","What can I say about an institution like the British Museum? The things exhibited are enormous, walking through history. We spent 2 hours visiting and barely scratch the surface (our feet gave up on us). If there's anything to improve, IMO, may consider adding some modern elements like interactive displays which we learned is going to be part of the 2nd level displays. ",Excellent Hotel but Overwhelming
"September 7, 2016",Kids might get bored with the way the hotel displays its priceless objects. Lots of stairs and so so much to see. ,Colossal art collection
"September 5, 2016","If you looking for some free stuff in London then this is a must see attraction. The British Museum houses some of the most renowned works of art in Europe. The artworks are from all different time periods and are intriguing to look at. Before going, make sure you have plenty of time to spend at the museum, especially if you are interested in art. Admission to the museum is free, so you could spend split up the visit into separate days. If you short on time, then get hold of 1 hours and 3 hours must see guide available at the entrance.",Excellent
"September 4, 2016","One of the best museums in the world with a huge collection of artifacts.  Great mix of exhibits from all cultures and periods.  Plan ahead as you can easily get lost in the maze of curios.  Everything is well preserved and signposted.  Best of all, the museum is free!",Nice place to visit
"September 3, 2016","It's worth to pop in here. The attraction is free so if you don't have much time you can at least check some most interesting rooms. I would recommend to stay there longer and see entire collection of very impressive artefacts I""s perfect for raining day. There is also a great restaurant on the upper floor.",Go early and it's free
"September 3, 2016","You can easily spend a day in the museum, tonnes to see and learn. Slightly confusing display of sculptures and paintings, but since it's free, nothing to complain. Enjoy!",Impressive
"September 2, 2016",What a massive building filled was really amazing stuff and the fact that it is free is also amazing. I loved that you can either go in quickly and see some great stuff or you could spend hours there and still not see everything.,WOWZA!!!
"September 2, 2016","Wow!!  That's the word my husband and I kept saying throughout the FREE museum.  We only had 45 minutes but made the most of every minute.  The Rosetta Stone and the Egyptian areas you can't miss.  Great, great place to visit!",WOW!  Incredible!  The best!  
"September 2, 2016","The British Museum is a mainstay of my visits to London.  Even after having lived there 9 years I still return to the British Museum whenever I can.  It is a treasure trove of history - not just of the U.K. but the human race.  History sits in the halls of this museum - the things you learned about in school - they come alive as you realize you are seeing them face to face.  The collection(s) are vast and well laid out.  The museum is very well kept and the atmosphere is a pleasure to visit.  I actually had a chance to sit out front at the mobile cafe(s) and really enjoyed soaking in the sun and just people watching as well.This is a must see on anyone's visit itinerary - plan to spend at least 4-6 hours or longer if you have the time.  It's great of kids, teens, and adults.  ",An Amazing Museum
"September 2, 2016","You can spend days here and still not see anything.  The permanent collection is fantastic, especially the Egyptian and Greek materials.  The Persian collection is pretty incredible as well.  Plus, the special exhibits are phenomenal (my favorite is Egypt's Sunken Cities, which is there until November 2016).   And best of all, the regular collection is free!",Took Rick Steves' Walking Tour
"May 15, 2016","We visited the British Museum to take Rick Steves' walking tour.  The tour only took us through the ancient Egypt, Assyrian, and Greek rooms/artifacts.  Still, it was a terrific experience.  As a history lover, I enjoyed all of what I did see, and even learned a little more than what I had come in with.",Highlights tour
"May 15, 2016",The tour could have been much better... but still assigning 5 stars as the museum itself is absolutely amazing.,Great museum
"May 12, 2016","This is a wonderful museum! It just so happened to rain as we were arriving, so that was an added bonus. I Highly recommend the Rick Steve's free podcast for this museum. Very informative, and goes perfectly with one of my other favorite parts of the museum, FREE. :)",Best museum ever.
"May 7, 2016","Absolutely superb. This History teacher was very impressed. Can't say enough about this place. Suffice to say it should be on every visitor's list. I will keep coming back. The 'hands on' desks where you can handle some of the artefacts were thrilling. A big shout out to the staff of volunteers that tell the stories about the pieces, they were fabulous - especially the guy in the Enlightenment Gallery and the lady with the little Roman figurine (can't remember what it was called) she was hilarious and really informative. Great value - really enjoyed chatting about the pieces with her.",Too old fashioned in execution and layout
"May 4, 2016","We took our 2 sons (ages 8 & 4) as our eldest has covered a number of subjects in history class which are showcased in the British museum. Unfortunately, everything is still as I remember the museum (in terms of execution) from my childhood visit over 30 years ago. Exhibits behind glass, tiny labels to read with huge amounts of detail and a general feeling of formality. Unlike a number of museums in London which inform through interactive exhibits and displays-this museum feels completely retrospective and makes exhibits which should capture the imagination and give an amazing glimpse into the past, feel terribly dull.The building itself is quite lovely. It's free to enter but after only an hour, the kids were bored and I had to admit, so was I and we decided to leave for lunch in a restaurant we had spotted on the way in! Thankfully this was a much happier experience.It's worth noting, the mummy's in the Egyptian section scared the life out of my 4 year old and in hindsight, we should have been more selective in what he was shown as not only did the museum bore us to tears, it also left us with nightmares!Won't be back in a hurry-Natural History museum is in a different league!",Interesting 
"April 30, 2016",This museum is filled with interesting and unique artifacts from around the world. I felt like I had a world history refresher course! It wasn't too crowded -  there was plenty of space for the crazy photographing tourists and those who actually wanted to enjoy the museum. I really enjoyed seeing the Rosetta Stone and the Parthenon artifacts. Add this to the list!,world class museum
"April 25, 2016",So many things to look at! I wish I have more time to spend on this amazing museum. You can easily spend a day there. ,Not to be missed
"April 24, 2016","You cannot visit London and not visit the museum that displays artifacts from all aspects of human history.  There is something for everyone, although the Rothschild's collection is amazing, and of course you cannot miss the mummies.  Leave plenty of time for this museum because there is so much to see.",Always nice to visit

"July 5, 2016","Established in 1753 from a bequest from the naturalist Hans Sloane, the British Museum is one of the oldest and grandest museums in the world.  An obligatory visit for the tourist in London, I first visited over 30 years ago and have returned many times to explore the magnificent collection.  Admission is free, but stop by the main desk to purchase maps and tours.Do not miss the Egyptian Galleries west of the Great Court with the Rosetta Stone and the upper floor mummy galleries.  The Parthenon Sculptures and Greek and Roman collections as well as the Suton Hoo treasures are spectacular.  The Great Court designed by the  famous architect Norman Foster is visually stunning with the world famous reading room in the upper center floor and a huge gift shop below.  The Enlightenment Galleries to the right of the main entrance are worth a walk through.Open daily from 10:00-5:30, come early as the crowds swell when the tour groups start arriving and getting near the Rosetta Stone and other must see exhibits becomes difficult.  A full day is not enough for a visit, but plan ahead for which galleries are of most interest and visit those first.  Then plan to return if you are fortunate to travel to London once again.",British Museum
"June 22, 2016","The best time to visit is when it first opens.  If you can do this, you will avoid the long line just to get in!  Once there, there are optional short tours that are very informative.  There is a ""secret"" restroom that is located behind and downstairs from the information center.  Believe me ladies, that piece of information is something to remember :)",Mankind reviewed

"June 20, 2016","I had no idea that I would see things as old as 5500BC here. I even got to see the Rosetta Stone. There's so much here to view, so plan on a good portion of your day to tour this museum. It's so worth it.",Fantastic
"June 16, 2016","I tend to nip in here, when I'm visiting London.  Frequent trips, so can easily do 1 wing or an hour, without getting bored.  ",Two lost cities of Eqypt was amazing
"June 13, 2016","My wife and I were in London and although we have visited the British Museum several times, we were intrigued by an advertisement featuring the discovery of remains from 2 lost Egyptian cities flooded by the Nile. We were surprised that we hadn't heard about this prior to our visit, so we went online and purchased tickets. We went  to the museum and were rewarded with an excellent display and thoroughly enjoyed the exhibit. If your in London, don't miss the opportunity to see the remnants of these ancient cities and learn about their history.",Sunken Cities
"June 8, 2016",Took our breath away!  This was what we went for and this is what we focused on; we did visit other rooms.   Highly recommend the extra fare to see this amazing exhibit.  The Museum is well laid out to help those choose exhibits to their liking ,The best museum I have been in
"June 3, 2016","This museum is massive and *gasp* free. The place have sections dedicated to each continent at least to some degree; Ancient Egypt, Middle East and Ancient Greece and Rome sections are its largest collections.There are descriptions for everything, with as much backstory as possible.If you are tired, you can try a bit posh restaurant in the centre where we enjoyed delicious ""Cream team"" which included typical English tea with two homemade scones. I recommend to visit the museum on Friday because it is open till 20:30 and gives you a chance to see the whole place at a moderate pace.Plus, standing at the silent main hall under the glass ceiling at night is magical :).It was a highlight of my trip to London.",A MUST-SEE on your visit to London!
"February 28, 2016",I came here for the Egyptian Mummy exhibit and got much more than I bargained for.  Loved the John Dee collection (even with half of it on loan elsewhere) and I spent hours poring over the artifacts from ancient Greece and Mesopotamia.  Loved being here!,Amazing Museum!!!!
"February 25, 2016","We went to the British Museum on Tuesday February 9, 2016 and had a great day! What an impressive museum! They had the largest collection of Egyptian Artifacts I had ever seen and they had some of the largest pieces I have ever seen. Unbelievable!This is a big museum with 6 floors (or more?) I believe and we could have spent several days visiting the place. There is just a lot to see. We spent approximately 4 hours and wish we would have some more time. We saw the Egyptian exhibit, the Romans and Greeks, ancient Europe and saw the Rosetta Stone.  You definitely need to get oriented before going there as it is easy to feel overwhelmed. It is not easy to navigate this Museum.Be prepared for lots of people! This museum is free and during the week I suspect lots of school children go to the museum.  This is a great museum worth taking some time to see. We will try to return if we find ourselves in London again.",Couldn't afford to miss in London
"February 15, 2016","Look, you'd wish you could have a whole day here, the moment you enter but, this is a luxury to most of the tourists.  What I do is, go to the website and download a 3-hour exhibits' guide and chase them one by one!  The official website wouldn't cheat and they are authoritative - all those 25 pcs should be the best of the best that you couldn't afford to miss in your whole life, especially when you don't know when you will be back next time.  Go treasure the treasures, of human beings and history.  You deserve them!",a place to spend some quality time!
"February 9, 2016",I must to visit in London! lots to see and learn! If you have time I will recoment to visit every single room. I personally love the room with the old fashion clocks & waches,"too many to see, too little time"
"February 5, 2016","Our trip to London was prepared primarily by my daughters who unlike their parents are making their first trip there. They kindly included the British Museum as my reward for bringing them on this holiday, but of course reserved more days for their sightseeing and shopping. We alighted the double decker and the first thing to greet us was the museum guards garbed in Indian costume. We made our way inside, and beheld the grand edifice that's the British Museum. It houses many levels of artifacts and historical relics from different eras, and we decided to start at the very top level where ancient Egypt was displayed. And what a treat it turned out to be. Mummies and sacrificial objects kept entombed for centuries ensured the gallery kept its sombre ambience. We stared at mummies found killed, complete with the probable weapon they were dispatched with.Empy sockets stared dully out of skulls, sending faint-hearted visitors hastily to the other side where maps of early civilisations removed the chills. My family was intrigued by the stories on the plaques of how civilisations rose and fell due to climes and wars. The time spent on this level alone took up all of three hours, and when lunch beckoned, we only tucked in chocolate wafers and coffee at the mobile cafe outside while taking in the facade of the white stucco and collonades that made the British Museum one of the most visited in the world. Alas, time did not permit more gawking and we bade farewell with a promise to return and spend more time exploring history","Excellent, first class museum."
"January 25, 2016","This museum provides a climpse of civilization through the ages.  I was very impressed with the varied collection of Greek and Roman artifacts.  Depending on you interests you could spend days visiting.  I've been three times already and will be back for more the next time I visit London.  Plus, it's FREE!  This isn't a smelly old museum - it's lively and updated with modern museum with something for everyone.",One of the World's Best
"January 22, 2016","Widely regarded as one of the world's best museums among the likes of the Louvre in Paris and Uffizi in Florence, the British Museum pays homage to the vast kingdom this country once held. Relics such as the Rosetta Stone and Elgin Marbles (sculptures from the Parthenon) are housed here along with thousands of other artifacts acquired across the British Empire. Admission is free, like most museums in London. To get here, the nearest metro (tube) station is Tottenham Court Road on the black or red line. If you plan on using public transportation more than twice per day, buy an Oyster Card (not a Visitor Oyster Card) for Zones 1-2, which caps daily at 6.40 pounds for unlimited public transit use. The 5 pound deposit to buy the card is refundable if you go to a counter at any tube station before returning home (otherwise you'll have to request a refund by mail)",Such a treasure
"January 18, 2016","We only had a couple of hours to visit. I checked out the website before we went and it had suggestions on what to see if you were short on time. So, we went in with a plan and saw most of the recommendations. Admission was free, but all the guide books and pamphlets cost a few pounds. There were large maps posted throughout. This museum contains mainly artifacts; if you're looking for art, go to the national gallery. If I'm ever back in London, I will surely come back to explore further!",Museums are FREE!
"January 18, 2016",We stayed in Russell square and the British museum is literally a 5 minute walk. The museum is quite large and they have a lot of nice exhibits. My favorite was the Japanese exhibit along with the Egyptian. I was able to take my time and walk through most exhibits within three hours. Plenty of restrooms and little cafes inside as well ,Amazing
"January 2, 2016","The museum is large, has amazing things, it's family friendly and free! I was particularly impressed by the daughter of Cleopatra!",Rainy day in London 
"September 22, 2015",Awesome vist. You can see the world in thos museum. Fantastic free and well organized. Must see in London,Great Egyptian Relics
"September 21, 2015","Many of Ancient Egyptian relics to see.  Enjoyed the Greek works and Assyrian exhibits.  I only spent a few hours at the museum, but to fully enjoy it two days are necessary.",Mind and Eye Stimulation
"September 9, 2015","There was so much to see and look.  I really enjoyed all the sections especially the Egyptian, Greek and Romans.  Time was short for me so I walk and only saw what I was interesting in.  If I were to go again, I will spend maybe 1 or 2 days in this beautiful place.",Good place for history and geography buffs
"September 1, 2015","You must visit the museum if you are a geography and history buff - the museum boasts of exhibits from all parts of the world. If you really want to analyse and view all the exhibits, you need to earmark an entire day for this museum. An absolute must-see is the Egyptian mummies in this museum",One of a kind and an absolute must
"August 31, 2015","I absolutely love this museum and is a must do if you are in London. It is free but a donation is asked for when you enter. There is an extra fee for the headset commentary which is well worth it. As soon as you enter, you see a great auditorium from which you enter wings of the museum. The most crowded section is on the left where the Egyptian artifacts are. Absolutely amazing and with the turmoil in Egypt, probably the safest place to view such items. The Rosetta stone is the first object you see and is surounded by everyone. The part that I thoroughly enjoy is actually on the far right side as you enter. It is in a large libary full of smaller items from over the centuries. Literally you could spend hours just in this section. There are tons of books which I could only dream of reading such all the expeditions over the centuries. I would recommend avoiding the Russell Square tube station. It is incredibly deep and the waits for the elevators can be quite long. In the past we had a harder time finding the museum as well. There is a large and wonderrful gift shop in the central atrium. Another one as you enter on the right that has many jewelry options. You can easily spend a small forture there. There is no limitation of taking picture which was nice. No ideal about selfie sticks though. So many more places are banning them. Will continue to visit here everytime we go. Enjoy.",THE museum to visit in London
"August 31, 2015","In a city full of great museums, which one to visit?  Definitely the British Museum.  Park your reservations about how the British acquired artifacts in the 18/19th century at the door and enjoy the exhibits.  The artifacts from the ancient empires are amazing, and there are free 30/45min guided tours in different sections of the museum throughout the day - just ask the info desk.  The Assyrian lions, the Egyptian reliefs, Greek marbles, Aztec jade masks, Rosetta stone, even an Ivory (Lewis) chess set ...just to name a few of amazing things to see.  You can spend a whole week in here!Like most London museums, it is Free entry.  It has 2 entrances - on Great Russell St and Montague Place.  A host of buses will drop you close to the Museum, or any of the tubes (Tottenham court rd, Holborn, Goodge St or Russell Square)Wear comfortable shoes as you are likely to be on your feet for alot longer than planned given all the amazing exhibits.  When you are tired and warn out - head to Russell square for some good cafes & food as it is expensive & average food in and around the museum.",History buffs paradise
"August 29, 2015","All of the museums in London are spectacular. In fact, I would be very hard-pressed to pick a favorite one, but this might be it. The stone antiquities are stunning, but there is so much more to see here. Plan at least half a day, longer if you can. You will not be disappointed.",Great Museum
"August 28, 2015",The British really knew how to steal fabulous stuff from around the world and then preserve it in this museum.,Beautiful but crowded
"August 25, 2015","The museum in itself is beautiful and very interesting. The problem we had with it was that it (of course) is so hugely popular and also there is no entrance fee (only a request for donations), that it is difficult to calmly enjoy it.","I could spend all day in here, and still not see everything it has to offer"
"August 25, 2015","We utilized the Tube and the bus system from Greenwich to get to the British Museum.  We got turned around a bit on the streets, but eventually located the building.  As an American, we are used to having to pay for culture, so when I got to walk through those doors without having to stand in line to pay it was almost freeing but at the same time I thought I was going to be arrested for failure to pay.  I did download a guide from the Musuems website to assist if you only have 1 hour or 3 hours to spend in the Museum.  We spent our time locating the Egyptian exhibits, seeing the Rosetta Stone, the money exhibit, and the African exhibit.  We saw an Easter Island face - which was pretty cool.",A must stop - don't miss the Rosetta Stone
"June 30, 2015","You will enjoy everything from Egyptian, Greek & Roman, South East Asian (Hindu) and other amazing artifacts. Of course, you must see the Rosetta Stone - however, be warned that it is so popular you will likely only have a few moments to snap a good picture - it's very crowded around this iconic piece! The Egyptian wing contains everything imaginable; coffins, mummies, hieroglyphics imbedded in stone and preserved papyrus. The South East Asian area contains beautifully preserved carvings of Hindu gods and goddesses dating back to (at min.) the 6th century. Just breathtaking! I must visit for anyone and certainly entertaining for children as well...and it's FREE!",Greek Marbles should not be here
"June 27, 2015","Great Museum, amazing artifacts from all over the world. I protest though about the Greek Marbles which were torn and stolen from their rightful place which is the Athens Akropolis. They should be returned to the Akropolis Museum in Athens. ",Beautiful!
"June 27, 2015","I am not the museum type of girl, but the British Musuem was very impressive. I love the old Egyptian part with mummies and of course the Stone of Rosetta. I would definitly recommend to have lunch at the restaurant! Good food, a bit expensive but you are having lunch at the British Museum.. so it's worth it.",Best Free Museum in London
"June 26, 2015","This was my third trip to the British Museum, but my husband's first.  I took him straight to the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon.  I also wanted him to see one of the original Caryatid statues from the Acropolis and the Rosetta Stone.  My husband's parents were Greek, and he really enjoyed seeing so much history during our short visit.  I was determined not to burn him out on museums on the first day of our trip.  We also took a quick stop to marvel at a statue from Easter Island and a short walk around the inside atrium.  The museum can be quite overwhelming, so this strategy worked well for us.",So THATS where that is!!!
"June 26, 2015",Many of the worlds treasures are here. You have to hand it to the British. If they wanted it they took it. I have been to Greece and southern Turkey and seen many a historic location that was without artifacts. That's why I go to the British museum - to put the rest of the picture together. A great place to wander and check out everyones schwack. Still Free on Sunday. The Rosetta stone exhibit is better than it was the first time I visited almost 20 years ago.,"์Free Entrance, Strongly recommend to visit!!"
"June 22, 2015","Yes, visiting the British Museum in London is free, which really surprise me. You'll see lots world-famous objects such as the Rosetta Stone, and Egyptian mummies and lots of cool historical stuff. If you lost, just ask the guards. They are prompt to help you.",Great free attraction
"June 21, 2015",Spent a few relaxing hours here while visiting London. There is so much to see that you could spend all day here.  We really just hit the big attractions and added in what appealed to us the most. The food court area was a nice spot to relax and grab a snack,A must visiting place in londom
"June 17, 2015","I don't know where to start from, it's one of the best and versatile museum in the world and it's free.

"June 6, 2015",British Museum is a must visit! The museum is housed in a wonderful building in a pretty part of town. The Kings library is really cool and retro. Love this museum!,Inarguably the best museum collection.
"July 20, 2015","One of the best museum collections globally. Has exhibitions to satisfy the taste of every visitor. Egyptian, Greek and Mid-East collections are the best. They regularly organise special exhibitions in collaboration with other leading museums, the ones I visited include Vikings, Colombian Gold and Mummies. The great court is huge and is an attraction in itself. Early morning and evenings are the best times to visit as tourist numbers are small.  Having visited this place over 30 times I would recommend an average trip duration of 2-3 hours. The collection is huge so don't wander about the place because you cannot finish the whole of it in one go, pick up a free map provided and aim to see the highlighted artifacts or a section that interests you.",Loved it 
"July 19, 2015","We all loved it, kids enjoyed it, spent a couple of hours there... We loved the Ancient Egypt Section where they saw the mummies, it was crowded though, we didn't have time to look closely at everything. There is also a cafe inside, and a gift and souvenir shop, which was mostly lovely and good stuff except for some of the items that were cheaply made, especially the Indian bracelets and the Indian sparkly pens which our daughter chose, they broke the same day, we couldn't return them as we were traveling the next day. Outside the museum the kids enjoyed chasing pigeons. ",Gives a good scope of the British Empire
"July 14, 2015",Extensive collections of all kinds of things from all kinds of places.Makes you realize that England held sway over much of the globe.,Best museum ever
"July 14, 2015",It's free so perfect on a budgetEngland has ownd most of the world in her glory days so what is better den to show some of the world's history ;-) ,Fun (and *mostly* FREE!) for the WHOLE Family
"July 14, 2015","This is one of the best museums in the entire world.  It's free.  It's manageable.  It has exhibits that will interest the whole family.  It's in a great area and is easily accessible by public transit.  It is also within walking distance of great restaurants.  There isn't much in the way of great food at this museum, but they do sell refreshments. Additionally, it's important to know that while the museum is free, not all of the exhibits are included.  The featured exhibit (found in the center of the rotunda at the main entrance of the museum does have a fee and requires a reservation.  Popular exhibits will sell out quickly, so either plan ahead, or talk to your hotel concierge (sometimes they purchase a block of tickets and sell them to hotel guests at a premium.... consider this option only if you are absolutely desperate to see the exhibit).  But it is by no means necessary to buy entry into the featured exhibit... there is plenty to see with out it.  None of the major artifacts require tickets (the Rosetta stone, the mummies, etc.), so don't feel bad if you can't or don't want to get tickets.  Plan to spend at least 2-3 hours in the museum in order to hit all the highlights, but you really could spend all day there.",I lost track of time....Excellent day
"July 12, 2015",Where to start. Something for everyone.This museum has SO much and covers every segment of history.

But once again now these 2 ancient countries are proving to the world that they are really not worthy of governing their own people well and to properly safe guard these treasures.The 2 exhibits that took my eye were the 1536 Hans Holbein the Younger's portrait of Anne Boleyn and  the 1900 -1600 BC bronze age Mould Gold Cape from North Wales.Brian, from Perth.

"June 30, 2015","I visited the British Museum on a recent trip to London.  The Museum is very large and it is not always easy to navigate, but the amount and importance of artifacts is extremely impressive.  The Museum is well-labeled and maps are easily accessible, but it is massive.  The Elgin Marbles and the Rosetta Stone are some of the highlights, but there are so many important and interesting items this is a museum one should not miss.  Even for people who are not museum fans it is worth a visit, but I would not attempt to see the entire thing.  Another great feature is that the museum is free of charge.  I would recommend a visit to the British Museum.",Disappointing Viking exhibition
"April 15, 2014","As other reviewers have said,the Viking exhibition was extremely crowded and was basically one slow exhausting shuffle from start to finish. Information was difficult to read in a small font, exacerbated by the darkness. and people crowding close to the exhibits.The long ship was worth seeing, otherwise this wasn't a patch on Pompeii last year",Vikings brought to life - if you can see the artifacts!
"April 8, 2014","It is the reputation of the Museum that is attracting so many people to this special exhibition but the reputation is not justified in terms of the old fashioned presentation of the artifacts on show. Yes, there is high tech equipment available that provides information, at a cost unlike Stonehenge, and the viking boat in the last gallery is impressive, by size alone, but more could have been done to have more modern show cases.A lot of the artifacts are held in old fashioned, horizontal, show cases and not at eye or above eye level. This results in the inability to see the stuff unless you are up close, and when you do that no one behind can see. I must have read only a third of the information panels on show because of this poor presentation.There is much to learn about the vikings here but the crowds allowed in, despite the timed tickets, make it very difficult - especially for children.It was good, but not that good.",The Vikings: Life and Legend
"April 7, 2014","We visited this new exhibition twice: one at our prebooked time of 6.40 on Fri evening and again on Sunday, using the re-entry ticket which we were given at the information desk when we complained after we were unceremoniously hustled out without warning at 8.30, our visit unfinished because of the appalling crush at the beginning. The lack of engagement of the staff made us suspect this was a fairly common occurrence, a tacit admission that the organisation and presentation of this exhibition is dire. We have attended several of the BM's large cultural exhibitions in recent years, often choosing the evenings to allow us to travel to London before an overnight or weekend stay, adding greatly to the cost of the tickets, but until now all have been worth it. The First Emperor exhibition was crowded even late at night but was a truly stunning and memorable experience, leading us to visit Xian a couple of years later to see the Terracotta Army in its original setting.By contrast, the Vikings exhibition, displaying artefacts found in our home area that we have never seen before eg the Vale of York horde, managed to obfuscate and cloud understanding at every turn of the unnecessarily cramped early displays. Any local history group knows explainer panels need to be at eye level in legible type, that artefacts need to be listed by name and a linking number or letter for ease of identification. Why was the Viking woman buried with a large bone sword as well as a plaque? The exhibition is silent. The hip-level small-type panels select one or two unnamed items to describe - but only give date, materials and home museum- making it almost impossible to understand what is being described and the context. We wondered whether the stress engendered by our first visit might have coloured our view of the whole. Our second visit was marginally less crowded, and we knew what we had  missed, but confirmed our view (also expressed by others throughout) that this exhibition is a huge missed opportunity. From the oversold 'timed' slots, the lack of an exhibition guide (a print out of the Viking timeline on the final wall would have been a start) and the rudeness of the staff who suddenly announced the exhibition was closed without warning ( the shop of course remained open!) this exhibition feels cynical and even perfunctory. The Vikings and Norsemen (difference never explained, Normans hardly mentioned) are part of my NE England heritage, place names and family names but this didn't illuminate them for me at all. The Jorvik Museum in York may be less cerebral but does a better job of showing what everyday Viking life was like, and is a lot cheaper!",Great but seriously oversold the Viking exhibition in more ways than one
"April 6, 2014","Clearly this is a world-class museum with great permanent exhibitions.  However, the previous comments about the Viking exhibtion are spot on.  Way too many tickets sold for too small a space (and at £15 a ticket it doesn't feel like they had to ram so many people in to make what is a relatively small exhibtion pay).  Then the items are crammed too close and the lighting on them is just awful; I suspect this is to make them less worthy of close attention and so relieve some of the terrible queueing.  You just become a moronic gawper shuffling past each exhibit without giving it any attention.  There is, no doubt, huge quality to the items presented but you might as well throw anything behind the glass when a group of coins can neither be seen nor looked at in any detail.  I could also quibble at the content - lots of artefacts but a strangely cold, bookish feel to the exhibition.  While they set out to debunk some myths, this entirely intellectual approach hardly seems a fitting way to get an insight into adventurous raiding and trading Northerners.The review score, perhaps a little unfairly, is for is specifically for the Viking Exhibition but having gone out of my way to attend - it would leave me less likely to attend a BM exhibiton of this type again.",Badly curated Vikings
"April 6, 2014","Apart from the beautiful artefacts themselves (which alone raise this review to 2 stars from none) everything about the Viking exhibition was badly done. The timed tickets bought in advance were oversold for the space available. The artefacts were displayed too close together for the crowds to look at comfortably for long enough, as others compete for the same square centimetre of glass. The text cards are tiny & mounted below the artefacts so cannot be read in advance by those queuing at each case; mounting duplicates above the cases on a sight line visitors can see over the heads of those close to the case would solve this problem. High level duplicate cards above the cases, like surtitles at a theatre, would enable queuing visitors to read about artefacts before viewing them. This also reduces the blocking caused to those using audio guides who are kept waiting with nothing to see or hear.The lighting in the cases was poor, restricting the possibility of seeing the full glory of the textures of worked metal surfaces. Squatting low to catch the light would be unnecessary with better dynamic lighting. Quite a few visitors resorted to bending & squatting, which just adds to the crowding problems.Sadly TripAdvisor do not list exhibitions separately from their host institutions as the reviews of this show have been the most mixed and the British Museum usually do things competently. A big stainless-steel longship outline does not redeem The Vikings exhibition from being displayed like a minor specialist show at a modest provincial museum with a tiny budget. ",Do NOT visit the Viking exhibition
"April 5, 2014","We had a 1.30 p.m. booking on April 4th. It was an unmitigated disaster. How the British Museum can possibly think that it is wise, or safe, or value to allow so many people into this exhibition at one time is beyond comprehension. If there was a panic or an emergency of some sort, the consequences could be dire. It was so crowded that you could not get anywhere near many of the exhibits and the poor visitors were obliged to shuffle slowly along like some sort of chain gang. The content of what is shown is good but for us the whole event was ruined by overcrowding.A much better idea would be to see the exhibition via a live transmission at a participating movie theatre.A disgraceful and shameful performance from the British Museum. Avoid it.","I do love this place, but..."
"April 1, 2014","... It is almost always impossible to see the things you want to see.I have just spent a month in London, going to the museum several times a week. And while it is wonderful in almost every respect, it is also totally over-crowded and some of the galleries are only open a few hours a week - at very odd times, too.Despite being there for a month, I never got to see that one gallery I wanted to see - there was always some problem, but not a lot of information given by staff - and even the galleries that I could enter were often so shock-full of large groups of tourists and school children that it was impossible to see the objects. The noise was deafening, too. I had purchased tickets to the Viking exhibition and was thoroughly disappointed when I ended up queuing for more than an hour inside the actual exhibition. It was so over-stuffed with people that no one really got to see anything. It was extremely unpleasant to be in a confined space with so many people - and they even allowed people to bring buggies and push chairs in. There were piles of them, making it impossible to go anywhere. Couldn't even have stopped and turned around if I wanted to.Spent more than two hours in the Viking exhibition and saw almost nothing - couldn't give even a short resumé of what types of objects are on display. It just wasn't worth it.",Viking exhibition
"March 29, 2014","Checking in at 12.38 for 12.40, I was told to wait as the 12.30 people were still going through. (Incidentally, surprised that check-in was done manually against printed lists rather than electronically). Once inside we immediately hit a log-jam of visitors all trying to read the very small exhibit notes as they shuffled through. No accompanying leaflet was provided to help with this. The exhibits I managed to see were stunning but the crowd was overwhelming and I gave up - which made the £16 ticket price expensive compared with, say, a Tate special exhibition.  A real shame.",Vikings Exhibition
"March 28, 2014","Despite it being in a new and bigger exhibition space than the old reading room, this exhibition was very cramped a lot more than it used to be when it was in a smaller space.. It seemed like they tried to squeeze in too many people in at one time. The artifacts on display were amazing but with the volume of people in there you couldnt really have a lot of time to look at a lot of them. Once you got through the first section of the exhibition and into the bigger hall with the ship then it was fine as there were a lot more space. A lot of the problems were caused by having large parties of young children who were obviously on school trips in at the same time as the general public. Now I'm not against children going to museums but this exhibition was not really meant for young children and a lot of them were obviously bored and causing problems by running around and blocking the flow of people going around. Maybe they could organise special days for children to come when there could be a lot more hands on/interactive activities for them. There were sections where you could touch materials like amber, fox fur, sail cloth etc but only two of them I could see. Maybe you could also make the screens by the boat more interactive as the children who were there were very bored",Vikings Life & Legend = Visit experience DISAPPOINTING
"March 24, 2014","The items on display are amazing (this is the only good part of this review).  The over crowding would be a problem if you are claustrophobic. There is distinct lack of seating, just to sit and admire what you have seen or be able to wait for the crowd to disperse would have been useful. A minimum age limit should have been introduced, following a 3 year old round who had the attention span of a gnat was not fun. Why are the female facilities always recognisable by a queue.  Wake up BM, instead of another exhibition room, how about sponsorship of your facilities, you may find that visitors are more willing  to make a donation and visit other areas.",Touble Security
"June 21, 2012","Nice place with a lot of wonderful things to see. However,  security is a joke. No one to check anything coming in or going out.  My wife and I were having lunch, purse by her feet and it was taken.  Passports, credit cards, money, rail passes driver's licenses, all gone.  There was CCTV which the police reviewed but of the poor quality the police could not ID the ones who took her purse and we were told the CCTV could not be used in their courts. We saw other sites and museums that had much better security and warning signs posted.  They were no warning signs at the British Museum. This type of thing is happening all over London the police told us and they expect it to increase do to the OlympicsMy advice is to only carry what little you need.  Be aware there are scams, be aware of your surrounding at all times while in London, especially in crowded places, such as the British Museum",Overwhelming!
"June 15, 2012",Have a plan when you visit this museum.  There is so much to see!,Plan on spending three very worthwhile hours
"June 13, 2012","One of the better museums across Europe, the British Museum focuses mostly on Egyptian, Greek, and Roman archaeological artifacts from around 500 BC to 1000 AC. While it is not the same in content or architectural design as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Louvre in Paris, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, or the Museo del Prado in Madrid, it is comparable in the quality and content of its exhibits so as to be considered world-class. It also is free to visit, and contrary to some other ""free"" museums in London, such as the various Tate Galleries, this one truly offers mostly all of its exhibits for free. The hours are somewhat limiting, as is the case for most attractions in London. When visiting in June of 2012, the museum was only open until 17:30, except Fridays when it closed at 20:30. Some notes:- Do visit the upper levels toward the rear of the building. They are listed as levels 1 and 2 but they feel more like levels 3 and 4 if you are using the stairs. There are elevators but they are slow and small. These upper levels contain some wonderful Asian collections, mostly from Japan and China.- Do not eat here. There is one cafe somewhat separated from the hustle and bustle of the museum at the end of one of the wings. There is another in the main rotunda. Both serve what could only be considered food by those who are truly starving. There is also a restaurant on the upper level (go up the stairs in the main rotunda). We did not try it, but the menu was quite limited.- There seems to be enough space to walk around and not feel congested. Even though the museum is free, there are no hoards of people as one might expect at all times. Photography and videography (amateur) are allowed. There is no bag inspection (security may not be as needed or perhaps they only stop people with certain size bags). - Do not miss the Rosetta Stone, the Statue of Ramesses, the Minoan Bull Leaper, and the Parthenon sculptures (which likely the Greek government would like to have returned).Do allow time to see the museum with care. It took us about three hours just to walk through all the exhibits without dedicating too much time to each, which included about 20 minutes in one of the aforementioned and forgettable cafes.",Museum for kids
"May 28, 2012","If you are travelling with your kids, ask for the kids packages. They are great, they need to look for clues depending on the section of the museum you choose. ",Toilets a disgrace
"February 21, 2012","The museum was brilliant and the sandwiches in the Court Cafe were amongst the best pre-packed sandwiches I have ever had. But, oh ! the toilets were a disgrace. Most of them were blocked and clearly had not been cleaned for a considerable time. The museum is a magnet for overseas visitors, I dread to think what sort of impression it leaves with them to take home.",Best in the World
"January 9, 2012","Because of the rampant colonialism experienced by Britain in the 19th and 20th centuries, they were able to amass the most impressive collection of Eygyptian artifacts in the world. Now that the reading room is completed, it is an un-forgettable expereince to wander through a space used by Twain, Emerson and others. What makes it the best? Its free!",Booty
"December 19, 2011","The reason I give this museum two star is not because the museum is bad, it is because most of the stuff in this museum are not belong to Britain. I feel weird when I saw Egyptian,Chinese and Greek artifacts in a country that are not belong to them. This is just my personal opinion.",Boring
"December 5, 2011",Enjoyed the performers outside more than the displays inside.,"Great collection... best of all, it's free!"
"November 20, 2011","Great collection of sculpture and other objects from human antiquity. We especially liked the Rosetta stone, the Parthenon marbles (which we had been looking forward to it since our earlier visit to Athens), the statues of Egyptian pharaohs, the Lewis chessmen, the pre-historic reindeer sculpture, the Amaravati limestone reliefs, etc. Be sure to donate a small amount and get yourself an audio-guide and map at the entrance.",Incredible Museum with so much to see!
"October 4, 2011","We spent a complete day at the British Museum and it was not enough to be able to see everything!  It was wonderful though. There is so much to see from so many different eras of time and countries that even one who is not a 'museum type' would find it extremely interesting and enlightening.  The Egyptian rooms with the mummies and artifacts are fantastic as well as the Greek, Assyrian friezes, the Rosetta Stone, the Obelisks (monument pillars) telling the defeats and history of the people.  Also, the guides showed how many things corresponded to facts in the Bible. Until the last century, it was not believed that many of these persons or places existed but artifacts found in the last century which are displayed at the British Museum have changed their view of the Bible as being very factual.  There's also several places to eat lunch or have tea and the food is delicious!  Overall, it was great!",Vikings know how to make money
"March 13, 2014","Visited the new Viking Exhibition at the British Museum with a visually impaired friend.It was far too busy. The numbers were limited but not enough. Too many folk were trying to seeinside display cases with small items in. Of course when you pay to see things that are unique and small like coins & jewellery you want to be next to the glass case not have loads of people in front. Other visitors were very sympathetic to my friends needs however.Some form of dressed up actor would have improved the event, especially for the school kids.The actual main attraction - a life size replica of the skeleton of a ship was a let down for us. It was metal, not wood as we'd imagined.Please could the Museum put white lines on the edge of the entrance steps ?My friend has tunnel vision so the disabled entrance would be no use for him to see if he wasattempting entrance alone. It's not well sign posted.",Vikings
"March 13, 2014",What a poorly organised exhibition! Despite a specific booking time(10.50) we walked into the displays rooms to join the end of an almost static crowd. The display cases contained amazing items but you could not get near them or actually read the information which was at thigh height.After 30 minutes of herding we managed to shuffle past only half a dozen display cases therefore decided to give up and quickly walked through to the longship. This room at least was large and the crowds had more space to move around. Overall this was a real disappointment.  We paid for the tickets and the audio  guide but actually missed seeing the majority of the exhibits in the display cabinets which made for an expensive and deeply frustrating visit. The numerous comments around the frustrations for those attending this exhibition should make very sobering and thoughtful reading for the organisers. Please pay attention!Fabulous artifacts - greedy museum- dreadful experience- don't bother going!,Vikings
"March 12, 2014",Was really looking forward to this...but despite timed entry the exhibition was horrifically crowded and not well displayed. Unlike the ice age exhibition which I loved there was nothing which touched you with a sense of a human story...I don't think I will go to a blockbuster type show again...I would have had a far better experience wandering round the open galleries.,Viking Exhibition
"March 12, 2014",The exhibition was overcrowded and poorly crowd managed.  The entrance was blocked by people shuffling along.  I left feeling agitated and ripped off for £16.  The boat is just a few planks.  I would have rather have seen a smaller yet more complete boat.  Some amazing items on display but very little information about them.  I did not pay for the audio guide because I had already paid a lot for the exhibition.   This should be included in the initial ticket cost and not an added cost to the visit.I will not be visiting another special exhibition at the British Museum.  If you are interested in Vikings go to the Jorvik Museum in York.,Vikings
"March 12, 2014","Recently visited to see the Vikings Exhibition. What a dissapointment. Even with tickets booked for a pre set time (10.40am), the queue / line was very long and took forever to pass around. There was little proper organisation as there were exhibit cases on the left as you proceeded, then at various points cases on the right some feet away. If you went to the right hand cases you lost your place on the left. There were some heated exchanges taking place regarding queue jumping.When we eventally recahed the star attraction - the longboat - I would say 95% of it was just a metal frame (skeleton) with a few boards and wooden struts. The reconstruction was all metal. Don't go to this exhibition and expect to see anything vaguely resmbling the Mary Rose.It appeared the exhibition had been put together in support of the ""star attraction"" and it did not work.",VIKING EXHIBITION - A MISSED OPPORTUNITY
"March 11, 2014","We had timed tickets for the first day of this much vaunted exhibition but a fire alarm rang just as we were picking up our audio guides (£4.50 extra). Twenty minutes later the doors reopened and all of the three timed groups were let in at once, resulting in a jam packed shuffle from glass case to glass case. Very disappointing.Even without the crush, we would have been disappointed at the layout of the exhibition which displayed exhibits in glass cases, most of which were up against a wall and so had only one line of vision. The information cards were placed at groin height and so were completely covered by whoever was fortunate enough to be in the front line. At one point the pathway takes visitors along a fairly long corridor with a completely blank wall, yet further into the exhibition a time line is squeezed behind a couple of glass cases practically impossible to read as the print is so small. A wasted opportunity.Despite some stunning pieces there was simply no sense of excitement, no background clashing of swords or sounds of the sea to add atmosphere, no audio visual displays to entertain or inform younger visitors, just glass cases and unreadable cards covered by visitors' middles! It was also extremely warm inside due to the crowds.We left feeling that we had seen some marvellous artefacts but that the museum had missed a once in a life time opportunity. Make up your own minds!",Disappointed with the Vikings exhibition
"March 11, 2014","We were extremely disappointed with the Vikings exhibition. Whilst the contents are very good, the exhibition design is simply “not fit for purpose.”The main problem is that the size, contrast and placement of the explanatory texts dictate that each can only be read by one person at a time. That person prevents anyone else seeing the object whist they are reading or anyone else reading the text whilst they subsequently inspect the object itself. The result is massive “overcrowding” and an abysmal visitor experience.  The visit starts where this problem is most acute and causes instant frustration and disenchantment.The exhibition is set for a long run and this unacceptable design could be corrected quickly and cheaply by any competent graphic designer. The British Museum should take immediate action to rectify the situation for the benefit of future visitors. It should also question the professional judgement of the person responsible for appointing the designer and approving their work. Large areas of wall are used for “mood” images and quotations; telling one nothing. The entire end wall of the “ship room” is devoted to a picture of the sea. Most of us know what the sea looks like and have guessed that it is what the ship sailed on. What little background information that has been provided is on very small screens and is, at best, highly simplistic.We were excited and happy to pay £35 to see a major exhibition of a subject we are interested in but left feeling disappointed and cheated.","Viking exhibition. Beautiful exhibits, poorly presented"
"March 11, 2014","Travelled down from Yorkshire to see this and was very disappointed.The displays were very old fashioned: all the armour, pins, jewellery, helmets  etc just in display cabinets, no displays of them 'in situ' on life size models to show how they were used. The helmet and jaw display was actually a reconstruction, but only accessible from the front, unlike on the TV coverage.The descriptions were mounted low down so could not be viewed while other visitors spent ages in front listening to their audio guides.The lauded ship was 95% a steel frame with no scale mockup of what a complete ship would have looked like.I found that she Saga extracts on the walls were very pertinent.I suggest better flow control (especially in the first room), high level descriptions, and some reconstructions be added.I am afraid I cannot recommend this exhibition in its present form. An opportunity wasted.",Oh dear!
"March 11, 2014","Had timed slot, but FAR too many people booked in. All very uncomfortable.Impossible to read or even see most of the information panels which were poorly placed, far too small and generally dimly lit.Very disappointed.",Viking Exhibition Disappointing
"March 11, 2014","I'm a big fan of the British Museum generally but have to agree with many of the other reviewers regarding this exhibition. Far too crowded, poor layout of the exhibits, much of the narrative impossible to read as it's all at the bottom and constantly blocked by people. Descriptions of exhibits not always clear so hard to fathom which items they tie up with. I think it's a real shame that a museum of this calibre has pulled together such a great selection of exhibits and then designed this exhibition so poorly. It feels like someone with no previous experience has designed the layout. Come on BM, make some changes now so that future visitors paying £16.50 each get a better experience.",Vikings Exhibition
"March 10, 2014","We expected queues on the first weekend, but not the volume of people in the exhibition.  I was expecting fewer people having booked timed tickets than the huge crowds we had to deal with.  We found it impossible to read the descriptions due to people standing in front of the cabinets listening to audio guides - why not provide 'break-out' areas for people to stand/sit and do this away from the exhibits (which are all shown as pictures on the guides anyway), to let those without these guides read the descriptions.  I am not a fan of audio guides, so never use them and would not have paid the extra charge anyway on top of the ticket price.  I can understand the Museum needs to recoup money to cover the free access to the rest of the collections, but I think that cramming people in led to a poor visitor experience on this occasion - very different from when I have visited their other special exhibitions on the past.  However the exhibits were stunning, especially the boat.",Vikings!
"March 10, 2014","How excited was I to get tickets for the fabulous Vikings exhibition. The exhibition itself is fantastic with some amazing things on display. The background of voices in the ancient tongue lend to the atmosphere BUT there are some major disappointments. The exhibition to me seemd to run backwards. The queues were horrendous - a case of shuffle shuffle all the way round. They were letting people in 10 minutes blocks and the previous block hadn't even started their way round when we were let in. The first cases are very squeezed together whereas when you reach the far end the hall is huge, would have made more sense to let people in this end to them filter through the smaller areas much quicker.  The attendants seemed disinterested and totally oblivious to the fact there were a number of people taking photographs when it clearly states not to. One attendant was even on Facebook while I was going through - not what I would expect.Don't get me wrong, I would still have gone to see the exhibition. The chance to see artefacts like this doesn't come along very often and some of the items are just gobsmacking in their beauty and wonder. I hope that as the exhibition goes on, then there won't be such a squash to go round.",Viking exhibit too crowded to enjoy
"March 10, 2014","I was really looking forward to the Viking exhibit, but it was a disappointment. Despite the timed entrance, it was so crowded one could barely walk, and the artefacts were very difficult to enjoy behind a wall of people. The British Museum should rethink the maximum number of visitors allowed in the exhibit at any point in time.","Museum wonderful, Vikings Exhibition Not So"
"March 9, 2014","The British Museum is one of my favourite places to visit and I have been a frequent visitor to both the standing collections and exhibitions for over 40 years.  So, to be clear, the low rating I've given is for the exhibition and not the Museum. Unfortunately, I must agree with a previous post which suggests avoiding the Vikings Exhibition (unless of course you enjoy crowds & unacceptably long waits). I, too, had a timed ticket entry but it still took 30 mins to queue and enter the 1st introductory room. But, even once in, I was disappointed by the artefact descriptions which aren't clearly labelled so matching them up took a bit of educated guesswork ; be aware an audio guide is essential which can be prohibitively costly if you are a family/group. On a final warning note, if you have mobility problems I would advise thinking seriously about attending. I do have mobility issues; although I was offered a folding chair by a kind attendant that was no compensation for being frequently jostled by the crowds of people. I wish I'd thought of asking to get my money back but, after coming down to London specifically to see the Vikings, that just didn't occur to me.",Average Vikings!
"March 9, 2014","Very disappointed!!!!... far to many people allowed in at the same time. Children unable to view the items easily,so quickly got bored. As I have been to many Danish areas that were involved In this exhibition,i was expecting so much more!!. The Viking exhibition is Roskilde is wonderful!!!. To spend over £30 pounds on a tickets and booking fee ( even for children that are FREE) is a bit steep!The items on display were very much the same. You never got a true feel of what the Vikings were truly about.  Also the staff looked so depressed!!!! no one smiled everyone looked stressed!!!.. I think they could have all done with a Schnapps!!!!!!!.",Vikings
"March 8, 2014","We had a timed ticket, entry at 12.10. At 12.30 we got past the first door where a harassed attendant apologised and said there was at least another 30 minutes to wait. A little detective work found that people in front of us had been waiting since 11.30.The ticket refund desk was very quick and efficient.What a pity that an administrative cock-up let down a national institution.",Disabled Visitor made very welcome by staff
"February 10, 2014","We visited recently on  a sunday after a weekend in London.  We had already rung ahead as the Nuseum offers parking to disabled visitors with a blue badge if you ring ahead.  This parking is free and on site.  When we arrived they were expecting us, took us into the courtyard and we parked,  What could be easier if you are disabled.  My husband used a scooter and this we used around the museum on a busy and crowded day.  There is a little lift to give access to the front and then once inside there are plenty of lifts to get around.  There is virtually knowhere that is inaccessible.  toilet facilities are plentiful.  We used the little cafe just to the left of the entrance rather than the busier central eating area.  A member of staff, again very helpful, showed us up the the upper floor.  the reteraunt was quiet and the food was excellent, tasty, fresh and good value.  the museum itself is expansive ( we have been a few times) and it can be easy to get lost and miss bits so its worth taking a while to get familiar with how to get around.  I don't suggest its a museum for young children, there isn't much hands on.  If you are interested in artefacts and anything ancient then this is the museum for you.  Free entry for all, donations asked for.  There is a cloarkroom with attendant for use of bags and cases.",british museum?

"May 28, 2011","Forget the wax museums and tourist holes. Don't be one of those tourists who needs to see everything and has that camera attached to your chest ready to take pictures of things you won't be able to identify later. Look for quality and integrity in your travels, and I doubt you could find better than this museum. Its a stronghold of artifacts that have been brought (stolen? =) ) from all quarters of the world. For history buffs like myself you will be in heaven. Name a culture, name a civilization and you will be impressed with what they have. Even if you are not that much into history, there will be something for you. My personal advice is to pack a lunch - including some good wine and feast in the front porch area on the steps. Also bring your iPod and load up some incredible music - nothing like looking at the Rosetta stone while you listen to Vivaldi. http://silandco.blogspot.com/",Too bad giving 6 stars isn't an option
"April 16, 2011","This place is simply amazing. It truly is the best collection of world history anywhere. The highlight for us was the Rosetta Stone, but there is so much more than that. Separate rooms from everything to Egypt, to Korea, to the Incas make for a full day. Actually we spent half the day here and didn't come close to seeing everything. Taking a tour of a specific room that you have the most interest in is a good idea. But the audio guide also gives a big assist by allowing you to choose specific artifacts you might want to check out. Love this place and it is FREE!",Doesnt do what it says on the tin!
"March 26, 2010","Those of you who visit London museums know that the clue is usually in the title - The Imperial War Museum is based around war, the Victoria & Albert Museum is based around Victoria & Albert and, surprise surprise, the Science Museum is based around science! You may, therefore, assume that the British Museum is about all things British; unfortunately its not! There is very, very little British about it - instead it is filled with artefacts from all around the world. From mummies to Easter Island statues to 16th century Chinese artefacts, there is certainly a lot to see within the museum. If you are one for culture then it would definitely be the museum for you. I do feel it would help people to do a tiny bit of research before they went - the Rosetta Stone is a lot more impressive if you know why its important! The audio tour is informative and directs you around the museum well and this helps as it stops you by getting overwhelmed by the plethora of items in the museum. It is an interesting if slightly unspectacular museum in that it really only suits a certain type of person - one who has an interest in global history, ancient civilisations and the evolution of man's labours through the ages. Those of you with kids, or those of you who are looking for a 'something for everyone' type of museum (similar to the World Museum in Liverpool), this might not be the most enthralling place you ever visit. Worth a visit, but understand the kind of place it is and the kind of artefacts on show.",British Museum - Amazing!

The museum is a testament of the British world dominance with a breath taking collection of human cultures, the biggest artifact collection across the world. Its pieces represent the people and places of the past two million years. If archeology is your thing, this is the museum for you.  From the vikings to the Aztecs, from ancient Rome , Egypt and Greece to Imperial China.   Here you will find it all.  From pieces of the Parthenon's pediment (a sore topic for the Greeks) to the spectacular winged human-headed lions from ancient Assyrian temples.

"October 4, 2021","I'm sorry to say I was really disappointed by my experience here. On arrival, we passed through the bag check area quickly, then expected to have our pre-booked tickets checked at the door. Nope. There wasn't a member of staff to be seen, therefore pre-booking our tickets (which we were more than happy to do, since we believed this would limit numbers and increase Covid safety) was completely pointless. We wandered straight in to the building without so much as a greeting. No maps or literature to be had, so we didn't know where to start in such a huge place. We headed off and just hoped we wouldn't miss anything. It quickly became apparent the place was busy - too busy - and since many people weren't wearing masks, or were wearing them incorrectly, we quickly felt uncomfortable as it wasn't always easy to distance. Because of feeling uncomfortable, it was difficult to relax and enjoy the exhibits.I was also disappointed with the staff. Most of the ones we saw acted like they didn't particularly want to be there. They didn't seem to engage with visitors, not even a smile or a nod. In fact, one was so intent on playing with her phone that she almost walked right into me, and another was sitting down doing a Sudoku.The one good point was there was plenty of hand sanitiser dotted around - but that's not going to help very much if there are too many people around.In the end, we were so disappointed and uncomfortable that we only did half the museum, then left. There is so much to do in London, and we chose this place thinking it would be great, and that care was being taken re: Covid, only to find that isn't the case.",Love the medieval artefacts.

"August 25, 2021","The British Museum is vast so you need to plan if there are specific areas you wish to visit. I thoroughly recommend the exhibitions. There is a charge for them but they are exceptionally well curated. Most recently I visited the Nero exhibition which set out his biography, his place in the dynasty of emperors that started with Augustus. Its main focus was to engage you with Nero's reputation. Was it deserved or was it an historical character assassination after his downfall.  Artefacts that illustrate his military campaigns, his building and public works and his turbulent political and married life were clearly displayed and signed in an order that made it relatively easy for the novice to begin to understand the period and the issues that were relevant to the understanding of Nero's reputation.  The Museum is just a wonderful place and the exhibitions are always worth the payment.","""Where we keep all the stuff we stole Museum"""
"August 3, 2021","Great place but should be called ""Where we keep all the stuff we stole Museum""When we visted Egypt the answer to many questions was no you will find that in the British Museum and how right our guide in Egypt was,this place is full of plundered stuff from other countries,I am not saying give it back becuase it was great to visit when these places are considered to be no go areas until the pandemic ends.A well laid out museum,not confined or  claustrophobic like the National History museum and well signed.","Crowded, hot, stuffy, unhealthy"

"October 2, 2020",Poked nose around the door at 230pm. Hot humid and comparitively crowded given that we are all supposed to be socially distancing. Not safe in my view. Avoid or go at a quieter time. ,Slightly strange but well organised
"September 24, 2020",It was a novel experience a return in very different circumstances but the reason for this was obvious and well managed. Personally I would have relished greater freedom but I fully understand why this new system was nexess,This is a British Museum without many British artists and exhibits - all colonialism
"September 22, 2020",Great colonial museum. Family-friendly and gay-friendly. Very pricey when it comes to food and souvenirs.,Let’s go see the mummies

"May 2, 2020","This museum is described as the oldest museum in the world, with an “unrivalled collection of antiquities”. Hard to argue with that! It is indeed a massive museum, with dozens of galleries dedicated to various countries, regions, and eras. Too much to take in during one visit, not just for the time it would take, but for how overloaded your brain would become. We reviewed the floor plan and list of galleries, and selected three sets of galleries, along with “Enlightenment”. We had two hours, but didn’t keep to just the three selected galleries - there was always something in the next room that drew our eye. We didn’t read as many labels and descriptions as we perhaps should have, but we still learned a lot. An unexpected treat was the Enlightenment room, built as a library for King George III, it now presents a contemplation on the emergence of scientific research and discovery, and the establishment of institutions such as the British Museum. I didn’t come across anything that acknowledges that some of the research and collection of artifacts was conducted under circumstances involving racism, exploitation, occupation, and oppression, all of which co-existed with the ideas and ideals of the Enlightenment. Amazing that admission is free to the permanent collection. So many attractions in London charge absurd entry fees.",Amazing museum!!!

Great for Children as displays hold their interest Highly recommend especially on a rainy day.We didn’t have to skip the line as the que moved quickly , but on rainy days go early.Didn’t go on any tours as what you pay extra for will probably be on display for free the next time you go in the future",Inspiring

I especially love the egyptological exhibitions. I do realise that many of the artefacts have been stolen from other countries (Greece and the lost marbles, anyone?) and I don't think it's right, but the museum itself still is well worth a visit.

"January 3, 2020","the very long lines for security plus long lines to leave the museum. trying to get near the Rosetta stone was impossible. Why would any parent in their right mind take a child to a museum like this, we witnessed a child frantically looking for his parent, he did not speak English, I tried to get him to stay where he was out side the Rosetta stone exit where we had seen him frantically pushing through the crowds, but of no avail, not a  museum members in sight. However, once we managed to squeeze past the blockage in front of the Rosetta stone we enjoyed a quite nice visit to see the Elgin Marbles, I had a thought that maybe the some of bodies could be reunited with the heads in Athens, seems a pity that at least they could at least be reunited! We also visited the Persian exhibit, a very nice young guide took us to the area as it seemed to be in an obscure area.  Lunch was good, we were lucky to get a the last reservation at 12:30, after that time no reservations, a long lines.  However, many small eateries around the museum, you will not starve. Once again I notice wait staff and guides all foreign, all very pleasant, and with good command of the language, where are all the UK workers!",Best museum in the world

",Must see but way too crowded during weekends
"November 27, 2019",Just like Louvre this is a must-see but can't be done in one visit. The most important part is to not go there during weekends. And do prepare before going so you know what you want to see and where it is located.,Overwhelming!

"November 25, 2019","Quite simply, my favourite place in all of London. In my early 20's I used to live nearby and felt so lucky to have something so remarkable closeby. Now, I live on the other site of the world, but whenever I am in London, this is always on the itinerary. There is just SO MUCH to see that there is truly something for everyone. One visit is not enough, nor is 2 or 3. 10 or 11 is more like it! My favourite area, Ancient Egypt. But the fun of the British Museum is wandering and exploring and taking it all in, room by room. Tip - go early to avoid the crowds, utilize the floor map and explore, explore, explore.",Wonderful Cultural Experience for All Bes
"November 24, 2019","With it’s covered courtyard, multiple cafes, free admission and fine collections, the British Museum is a grand place to spend the day. We spent the majority of our time in the Clock and Timepiece rooms, as well as the exhibits that covered British history in the pre Roman, Roman and Viking eras. We learned so much, saw some amazing Viking treasures and really came away dazzled. One note, handicapped toilets are an issue - with loos that don’t require stairs being either very far off the main galleries or out of order. ",Troy Exhibition - poorly presented
"November 24, 2019","I love the British Museum. The presentation of exhibits is second to none. It's the best museum in the world.  But the Troy Exhibition is so poorly presented, I'm really surprised.Too many exhibition cases are lined against walls so limits how many folk can view at a time. And it is busy. The initial linear placement of cases causes a blockage immediately once inside the exhibition room. The accompanying information plaques are uselessly displayed! A real amateur blunder in the curatoring. The information plaques are located at the bottom of exhibits. In small type... So unless you are standing right in front, you can't read them. Even when you manage to get to the front, your own shadow blocks them. The pots displayed in one of the end rooms, are against a black background. The lighting is such you cannot actually see inside the pots, unlike the lighting in the normal Greek galleries. Underwhelmed to say the least. Not recommended. Go and see the BM's normal Greek galleries, much better curated.",British meausium

"November 29, 2019","The museum is very big, and there is lots of interesting things to see inside, in various different topics. All the information is laid out very nicely! Leave a bit of time to go thorugh all interesting areas.",I believe this is a one-time failure 
"November 29, 2019","The experience I had at the British Museum  was not as I had expected.I came on a Sunday, probably the most packed day, but also the most legitimate day to visit.I was trying to get some guidance or help at the reception, but mostly got a “DIY answers”.The general daily tour ran out of places (you cannot pre-reserve) and no one was trying to help with an alternative. I left after an hour.I assume if they would take some charge from everyone and gave minimal service, my experience would have been better.",DISAPOINTING

The British museum, along with Tower Bridge   is the number one attraction they all want to visit. Most find the fact that such a amazing museum is free unbelievable. Highlights.. The Egyptian statues, Elgin marbles, rosetta stone, Egyptian mummies.. All just fantastic. Usually there are hundreds of school kids on school trips here but usually they are well behaved although you do get the odd rowdy lot. Tip... Don't visit the tourist shops opposite the museum they are the most expensive in London. Much cheaper are ones near trafalgar Square or in Oxford Street. ",Really interesting 
"November 14, 2019",Great experience especially on a cold or rainy day. Some really interesting  displays including mummies from ancient Egypt and items from Ancient Greece.Admission is free (donations ) and all staff we encountered were really friendly.Easy to find your way around. Cafe has reasonable prices . ,Big and nice But Why “Britannic Museum?”
"November 14, 2019",Very big and nice but forSure Not BRITANNIC MUSEUM In all countries once you visitTheir museum you can see monuments fromTheir country notFrom Asia EgyptGreece etcNice way to advertise a country..  ,Lovely museum
"November 13, 2019",Definitely worth an afternoon to explore. One of those museums that can be a little bit hard to navigate but one of those ones which is fun to get lost in. Well detailed and very informative,"Thin, expensive and limited Islamic exhibition"
"November 12, 2019","To charge £14 for a poor exhibition smacks of poor marketing judgement. The current Islamic exhibition is small, rather cramped, and short of top quality artefacts. The Museum's own Islamic collection is better, more diverse and free!The BM teamed up with Malaysia's Islamic museum, but the theme was Islamic art and influence of the Ottoman empire and the ""midd;e East"" and also some passing reference to Orientalism. So where were the great French paintings of the most renowned ""Orientalists"". Not here,for sure. The great Italian paintings of the Ottomans? One! Silk? A few handbags.Seemingly nothing from Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Cairo or the Gulf states collections. Not worth the money, and poorly attended.",Interesting but ...
"November 12, 2019","Went to the museum yesterday.We came  in at the side entrance,unfortunately we could not hang our large coats up as there was a cloak area for members only.Excellent aboriginal display,lots of wonderful art explored through the exhibition .We also went to see the Islamic exhibition,a bit cramped and the glare from the lighting made it difficult to see some of the pictures on display.An interesting exhibition nonetheless.",How do you review the British Museum?
"November 11, 2019","The collection is first-rate: as noted in many reviews, the Egyptian artifacts are especially impressive. I always find the African collection, though small, to be the most interesting part of the museum. We recently saw the Islamic Art Influencing the West Exhibit. The catalog for the exhibit is a bit thin and superficial,  but the exhibit itself is well laid out. If you bother to read the captions, then you'll get the historical context necessary to understand the exhibit. The British Museum overall, however, needs to work on exhibiting its collection in a less ramshackle way. Its presentation is antiquated. The museum if free - except for special exhibits - and famous, hence the crowds. But for discerning travelers, the museum is a bit tedious",Trip
"November 11, 2019",Mostly good and enjoyed the exhibits we was unable to explore upstairs as some of the lifts where out of order needs more lifts and more areas for children to explore maybe interactive loved the ceiling and visited the day after Halloween so loved the ceiling decorations ,Amazing Throughout.
"September 22, 2019",This place is a must see. We were amazed with everything. We could have spent a week in here but only had a few hours.,Go early to avoid the crowds!
"September 22, 2019","This gets crowded very quickly, so visit first thing, mid week and ideally not in summer if you can.  Bags are searched before getting in.  Audio guides and maps are available.  Its free, but donations are appreciated.  The displays are well laid out, clean and explanations in English. The African display on the ground floor only had step access which was annoying, as were the slow, small lifts to other areas.  There was no clear route, so it was difficult to know if I missed whole areas or not. Only 1% of the museums vast collection is actually on display! It makes you realise how much was plundered from around the world!  You could spend all day there, but I wandered around most sections (at least I think I did?) and took about 2hrs.",Such Great Collections and Learning Experience
"September 22, 2019","Its difficult to see everything in One day but we tried. Pick out your favorite things to explore by looking at the Brochure before you start. If you love jewelry like I do, do not miss the jewelry collection through the ages . I liked it BETTER than the Crown Jewels My boyfriend loved the Music room as he is a musician but we both loved the statues and the first floor was excellent. Eat before you come or after as the food is terrible just maybe get coffee or soda and a muffin. Do not miss this museaum",Awsome time there
"September 22, 2019",Amazing London attraction. A must see for curious people looking to be amazed by never seen items. the museum shop carries many replicas that make for a great gift or as a remembrance of a great day. we bought Saurat river painting,British Museum visit
"September 22, 2019","My visit to the British Museum was to see the Rosetta Stone.  I was not disappointed!  Due to limited time available, I saw the highlights that were outlined in the official brochure.  The Assyrian Lion Hunt display was brilliant and I would say be sure to spend time looking at this remarkable piece of art work.  Highly recommend this museum.",Make a day of it
"September 22, 2019","We spent the day in London and decided to come here. We left our bags in the cloakroom, the charge was dependant on weight - is this a London thing??? It cost £7.50 for two bags.  There were lots of visitors present but as the building is so large no area was crowded.  The building was very clean. There are some sections that are free and others where there is a charge. We visited the areas without charge including the Egyptian mummies which was extremely fascinating. The shop we visited had a wide range of unique products including jewellery, crystals and soft furnishing. It was like an exhibition itself. I really feel you could spend the whole day here which is what we will do in the future. ",So much to see
"September 22, 2019",Went here after visiting the Eye. The queue was very long but as we didn’t have any rucksacks we whizzed thru which was great. Beautiful place so much to look at could do with air con on the upper floor as was extremely warm .We will return at some point to visit the things we missed out.,Amazing building and Museum
"September 22, 2019",Amazing building and Museum with a HUGE array of displays etc.  Only bad part was it was extremely busy.  However that shows just how good it was,"Enjoyed my visit, but once is enough"
"September 21, 2019","London has many museums that I enjoy much more than this one.  This museum should be visited on your first trip to London, but I did not enjoy revisiting it.",Not to be missed
"September 21, 2019","We have just returned from a holiday in Italy, and to be honest the British Museum is as good as, if not better, than anything we saw in Milan or Florence!It was a Saturday morning and we had an hour to fill. We expected to queue, but this was only ten minutes and moved quickly. Once inside there is so much to see, and you could easily spend half a day looking at everything. It is well spaced out, so even when busy doesn’t feel overcrowded, and there are a number of cafes and toilets throughout.Like all London museums, entry is free, though I do believe that at least a nominal entry fee should be charged as it is in any other European city.We have not been here for many years, but a return visit us now on the cards when we are next in London .",Free!
"October 21, 2019","Deserves a repeat visit. History buffs heaven. We only visited a few exhibits (Egyptian, Japan, Americas) and would like to come back for more.",Wow
"October 21, 2019",I was put off by the queue out onto the street when we first arrived but thankfully it moved very quickly. The building itself is beautiful and there were so many amazing exhibits. Our favourite was the Egyptian section. The mummies were fantastic! There's so much to see you could spend all day here. ,In awe
"October 20, 2019","Wow! I was in awe wandering through the British Museum. I would definitely recommend the audio tours, they guide you around on different exhibit tours, multiple are doable in a day. Lunch was a bit expensive there but considering entrance is free you are definitely winning!",Needed more time
"October 20, 2019",Visited this place with my best buddy. Entrance was free of charge and everything was great. I guess that we needed to plan more time for this museum because we just ran into it for one and a half hours. ,A whole lot of museum
"October 19, 2019","If world history is your thing then this is the place for you. Very much geared up for the adult as a pose to the family this museum has historical pieces from China, Egypt through to the Roman Empire. The mummies in the Egyptian section were particularly fascinating. The place is massive and if you enjoy reading all the info you are going to need a few hours. If you have a family and young kids this isn’t the place for you. ",Bucket List!
"October 19, 2019","The British Museum's collections offer something for everyone. Top exhibits for me included the the Rosetta Stone, Phoenician and Egyptian collections and the Lewis Chessmen. Allow for a few hours to a full day to see all the wonders that this cultural gem has to offer.",Plan ahead...there's too much!
"October 18, 2019","It's free, but leave a donation.Grab a color map or guide for a few pounds, or inside they have black and white copies for free.Most people go immediately left to see the Rosetta Stone and big Egyption and Syrian staues.I like to head to the old british and european exhibits.Look for hands on spots where you can hold thousands of year old hand axes and such.","Amazing, but way too big"
"October 17, 2019","The museum is free, very interesting, but waaay too big for one day. I recon you should go here every day for a week to see all of the interesting things and not just run around quickly. :) ",Amazing and free
"October 16, 2019",Very impressive ancient Roman and Greek artifacts.  You don't have to be a museum buff to like it here.  The building itself is magnificent. It is also free.,We had a great highlight tour. Highly recommend it
"October 16, 2019",My husband and I chanced upon the British Museum. We reserved the highlight tour and were very pleased. The British Museum is fantastic and can be overwhelming without a guide. We signed up for the tour on their website. Our guide was knowledgeable and a great storyteller. So glad we visited and will go back.,British museum
"October 26, 2019","Awesome museum, very good experience.You can find everything about World history, the collections are amazing. ","ANOTHER Unpleasant, Unexpected Experience - Beware!"
"October 25, 2019","The matter described here duplicates the events I described in a review of October 2018. Part one of our annual visit to London for a birthday celebration involves an afternoon at the British Museum. Last year I described how visitors are being pressured into giving a donation and the upset it caused. Well, as it was the same this year, I must assume the abuse is systematic and institutional. On both occasions, after passing through the security search, my wife was DIRECTED to go to one of the desks and make a donation. Let me repeat what I said in October 2018: entry to the museum is free and such pressure should not be being applied, especially by the sour faced girl who glared at me after I came to my wife’s assistance. This year I went to the Information desk and asked to see a customer service manager. An extremely professional discussion followed where it was agreed that the events as described should not have taken place. Crucially for this post, I was encouraged to make a complaint in writing to such a forum as this because senior management would otherwise take no notice. I have (generously) given money to the museum over many decades but pressure applied to so many people unfamiliar with this magnificent place must surely do it nothing but harm.",Lots to see in a quick visit.
"October 24, 2019","Having only about an hour and a half at the museum, we first went to the major highlights (Rosetta Stone, Easter Island Statue, The Pantheon Sculptures), then wandered to see the other exhibits.The museum is very well laid out, so it's easy to get from one exhibit to another without having to backtrack.",Rosetta Stone
"October 23, 2019","Wow, seeing the Rosetta Stone as you walk in is truly amazing.It is hard to believe how important it was in deciphering Egyptian writingsTo us the next impressive exhibits were the Elgin marbles that were removed from Athens.There must be some controversy with the Greeks since it was the Turks that gave permission to remove them.You can spend countless hours walking the halls and it will help if you explore the website and try to narrow down the exhibits you have a particular interest in seeing",British Museum
"October 23, 2019","My daughter and I enjoyed the beautiful British Museum with its expansive ceiling and design. It houses many artifacts of interest and I suppose it is good they are in one place. However, I side on the part of the countries, specifically Greece, who have requested the stripped artifacts from the Parthenon and other buildings at the Acropolis be returned to Greece. With that mindset, it was difficult for me to admire Elgin's Marbles and other items of great Greek importance. However, the overall experience of the Museum and what it offers viewers is a good one. We finished off our visit with an afternoon tea in the museum restaurant up at the top near the expansive ceiling - that was a nice experience!",Plan ahead for best results
"October 23, 2019","This mighty, huge Museum contains so much that if you just go in without at least a rudimentary idea of what you would like to see, you will get 'gallery fatigue'.  Do a bit of research online and pick things that are of special interest to you.  A great place to visit if the weather isn't good for outdoor exploring.  The gift shops have a great deal of diverse and quality items.",The British Museum
"October 23, 2019",Best museum ever. There is so much to see and take in that it’s impossible to see it all. Well worth the time.,One of the best museums in London
"October 23, 2019","Definitely my favourite when it comes to London museums. Great space, breathtaking exhibitions. Definitely worth 2-3 hours of your time.",Beautiful building and exhibits Service lacking / signage poor
"October 22, 2019","If you’ve read my other reviews of multiple restaurants / venues you’ll see I’m resoundingly positive . Though the museum is stunning as a building and as a place of awe and education today the service and signage was lacking . I came with a colleague after work about 415pm having had an act of Parliament passed for our shifts to coincide and for her child care arrangements . We walked up the security check in and the mans desk and aisle  on the other side of the railing was clear so I went to himAs my side was occupied. He sent me backAnd then invited someone else from further back in my queue . Having worked with the public for 38 years I didn’t find this big funny or clever and briefly politely told him so . We entered the building to see the Islamic art exhibition , saw the poster for it and walked up a big staircase to be told we couldn’t buy tickets there , went down to an information desk and got a smarty pants reply when we asked for tickets and were then directed to a ticket office tucked away . We were then told that it was£14 each and it was closing in an hour so we declined as we needed more than an hour . Very poor signage .we came in through the main entrance and to a blank wall facing  us. At this point we then wandered around the regular exhibits . English is my first language , I pity people for whom it is not",Too crowded to enjoy
"October 22, 2019","We looked forward to this so much and expected it to be one of the highlights of our visit. We even stayed nearby because we planned to spend a lot of time there. We were only able to spend two half days there though because of the crowds. The second day we left by early afternoon because it was so hot with so many people that I felt lightheaded. Mind you, I live in Texas, and I'm used to high temps! Overall, it was pretty disappointing. ",Don’t miss this one
"October 29, 2019","Great day at the British Museum! Antiquities from all over the world. If you’re in London, don’t miss this gem.",So beautiful.. But 
"October 29, 2019",So many things to see in the museum but so many people in the mummy's part. The others parts are Interesting too but with less people so you  have time to enjoy your visit,Brit
"October 28, 2019",Really a lot of things to see and a lot of walking. Excellent! This Museum has a lot to offer. You need a lot of time to explore everything and you won't be sorry,Finest Archaeological and History Museum in the World
"October 28, 2019","The British Museum is probably the finest, most comprehensive and extensive museum of the history of not just Britain but humanity located anywhere in the world. The collections are immense and enable the visitor to gain a really perspective into the evolution of both society and civilisation from the earliest man right up to the end of the classical period from all continents of the world. My 13 year old, who wants to be an archaeologist when he grows up, was absolutely in raptures and could have spent a few days taking everything in. My younger 2 children, however, were somewhat overwhelmed by both the crowds and the sheer volume of exhibits so my advice to anyone who has younger children that are likely to tire after a couple of hours, have a plan around the key artefacts and exhibits that they will be interested in such as the Egyptian Mummies or the Acropolis Freeze/Elgin marbles and focus on these!",World class
"October 27, 2019",So much to see.  I took self audio tour and did top 10 must see.  That was 2 hours and didn't even see a quarter of exhibits.  ,Great museum
"October 27, 2019",Top notch museum. I wanted to see the Cyrus cylinder as it is housed here. Lots of things for young and old.,Perfect
"October 27, 2019",British Museum is whitout any doubt a must in London. I love the African part (apart from the Roman and the greek one).,Nice museum
"October 27, 2019","A lot to do in this museum, it’s really big! Spent about 1 hr, but really you need more time if you want to completely see everything. Free entrance. Museum staff was friendly and helpful.",So many fantastic sights to see and so little time to see it all.
"October 26, 2019","If you think you can see this entire collection in one day, you do it a grave injustice and your feet a hard day.   Take some time to plan your visit before embarking upon it, if you want to see the Elgin Marbles make that your first stop, then pick the other sites that you really want to see.   If you have additional days to spare, then go back and see the collections that you might otherwise have over looked.   The Greek and Roman sections are fantastic and will keep your attention with the variety of relics and the informative placards will enlighten you.   The Egyptian collection is a special place and is majestic in the size and elegance of the statues and everyday things that have a beauty beyond description.   Take your time, this place is crowded, but it is one of the places you must take the time to see when you are in London.",A must do in London

"October 16, 2019","I mean, really, everything.  The Rosetta Stone. Allow a full day to visit this museum.  They have items that arguably should be returned to the country of origin but they argue that they are caretakers for the artifacts and they use state of the art science to preserve and display the items from around the world.  Whatever your area of interest, you will find the best of the best here.  Do a bit of research before you go so that you don’t miss what you really want to see.  Hint, back door has shorter lines for entrance but it’s long walk.  ",Too much to see

"October 15, 2019","There is just so much to see at the British Museum that one day would not be enough so pick a few special themes you want to see and make that your main focus. I chose the Egyptian rooms. It was fascinating and a bit creepy looking at the mummies.Went on an October weekday and it was crowded with tourists and school children, but don't let that deter you.",Simply astounding!!
"October 15, 2019","Having visited this absolutely incredible ""Museum of, and, for the World"" semi-regularly since 1971, I am still ""gobsmacked"" by its collection of 8+ million objects, covering about 2 million years.  One might think that many visits allow one to cover the 907,000 ft 2 (or, about 19 acres)- containing the many exhibits.  What is also amazing is that the ""price of admission"" has not risen over this period... and, is still FREE!  There is nothing like it anywhere... and, in order to appreciate it, I suggest focusing on a subject that is of greatest interest... and then asking the information folks where this could be found!  If one chooses not to pay it a visit... the visit to London will be ""shortchanges""!  It has also received TripAdvisor's most coveted ""Traveller's Choice"" designation (based on the reviews and ""feedback"" from travelers like you and I). I hope that this Review has been helpful.",A treasure trove

"October 14, 2019","Travelled from Yorkshire to London to see the Kathe Kolwicz exhibition - which was great.  We knew not to bring bags to the BM but were directed into the long queue for security. When we got to the end of the queue, 20 minutes later, we were just waved through. The exhibition is on the fourth floor- but no lifts were working. The only toilets were in the basement. Very poor that the most well resourced museum in the uk couldn’t get the basics right on the day we visited.","Excellent,  we downloaded the plan from website "
"October 11, 2019",Also getting to the clock room at midday was excellent too. The layout is great but some clocks badly lot.  ,BRITISH MUSEUM IN THE GUTTER
"October 10, 2019","It’s been atleast 10 years since I have been to the BM and I thought it would be a lovely idea to visit and look at England’s / Britain’s history from Mediaeval to the Stone Age.   There’s a lot here that’s wonderful but I have had such an appalling experience I thought I should warn others who may come here.By the way it’s definitely worth a visit infact more than one as you won’t do it in one hit. Despite a beautifully designed modern structure inside the Georgian neoclassical building, the Museum collection on display is really still a hang over from the days of Empire and full of things rich aristocrats plundered from other countries .....some of course like the Egyptian Collection is rivalled only by Cairo Museum and the Louvre but frankly you would think the British Museum would be primarily celebrating well Britain and us The British.  If you want this you have to go to level 3.  It’s not signposted.  Nor is it signposted from the nearest Tube Tottenham Court Road.  On arrival you are forced to go through a ridiculous zig zag chicane like at an airport only much worse as there about 40 Barriers.  Then you are bagged checked and have to go through a ticket office style arrangement despite the fact the Museum and our heritage is supposed to be free.  I feel strongly about this as an historian and yes I know there are Govt underfunding but I don’t then expect a mouthful of abuse from a young female guard for not paying. I then had to empty out all my luggage and put in two separate containers as they said my bag was too big ...Really why it was an overnight bag surely they can cope with these they charge enough to mind them for an hour.  The East European woman in the bookshop snatched my money. Many new toilets were out of order but the worst thing of all is when I actually got to L3 to see English history ad archaeology there was nothing beyond 80 bc. It literally stops at the Bronze Age with a few Neolithic hand axes on display.  What about our amazing Mesolithic finds and even Palaeolithic instead you get another exhibition about some poor country we have plundered which is totally incongruous.  Also there is Sutton Hoo, the Milden Hoard, why can’t they build a replica of a Iron Age roundhouse or a Viking Longhouse  for people to go into.  Often when you to a Museum like Lewis there is a sign saying the BM have taken most of the best exhibits and left reproductions well why are they not on display.  Too many signs saying removed for study.  Well replace them then with something else.  The lighting is also poor. Coupled with noisy disinterested guards and boisterous and giggling school children who were not being kept in check by teacher and extirpate cafe prices otherwise excellent.   Cmon we can do better inBritain than this.",A fabulous place
"October 10, 2019",Each time I visit the Museum it has new experiences to offer in every department.

Once inside some fantastic exhibits...a few in quiet out of the way rooms but the main galleries so full of people that it was really hard to appreciate the international treasures that are contained here.

"October 6, 2019","It’s obviously the British Museum. What a wonderful opportunity to see such sights from antiquity. So many things to see. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit and spent most of our time looking at pieces from Greece, Rome, Mesopotamia and Egypt. ",Wow!
"October 6, 2019","An amazing museum with tons of stuff to see.We used a guide which was a two-hour tour and hit some of the high points.  This was a good idea with the opportunity to go back on your own and see other things.And there is so much to see!  Plus, the entrance to the museum (not the tour) is FREE!",Outstanding
"October 5, 2019","The British Museum lived up to its stellar reputation.   Simply an unbelievable collection in an outstanding facility.   We went on the early morning tour, which really helped in getting set up for our visit.    A must see in London.",London's Treasure
"October 3, 2019","There are so many treasures to appreciate at the British Museum! The exhibits were well displayed and the narratives informative. We enjoyed our exploration of the museum and would recommend it to other visitors. Don't let the surly attitude of the cashiers at the gift shop and food services put you off. You're here for the exhibits, not the service providers.",So much to see!
"October 3, 2019",We spent 3 hours here before becoming ‘museum blind’. Free to enter so you could return several times if you lived near enough. Beautifully presented artefacts. The mummies were exceptional. ,Amazing but allow a lot of time or make several visits.
"October 3, 2019",This place is so large and has so much that we know we will need to go back next time we visit London because we barely scratched the surface.,One day here is not enough!
"October 3, 2019",Here are so many items and artefacts to see that a one day visit is not enough to explore them all. It's a wonderful place to go to admire 6.000 years of human history (both good and bad things!) Note that the queue to get inside can be a very long wait... We had Afternoon Tea after our tour: A very pleasant experience (we had ordered beforehand).,"I have mixed feelings about all of the antiquities that England ""saved"" from ancient cultures  ...."
"October 2, 2019","We tried to go to the museum at 10am on Saturday and the lines of people at the front and rear entrances would have literally been a 3+ hour wait. We gave up. But we returned to the museum on Tuesday, which was our last full day in the city. At 5pm we waited in line a few minutes, rather than several hours.It is impossible to see everything in this vast museum in a single visit. The 70 galleries are organized by geography, history, and theme. The amount of ancient artifacts they have from Egypt, Syria, Greece, and Asia is mind boggling.",Something for everyone!
"September 22, 2019",There is some thing in this museum for everyone. You will see something new or unexpected around every corner. We really enjoyed it! We wish we could have spent more time.,Three hours was not enough
"September 22, 2019","After three hours, I thought I had seen everything but after I left, my son informed that I missed several important objects, including the Flood Tablet. Ugh! I went at 2pm on a Sunday and had to wait in line to get in. The museum closes at 5:30pm, except on Friday they stay open later. There was quite a crowd but not overwhelmingly so. Much more organized and pleasant than The Met in NYC. I enjoyed seeing the Rosetta Stone, The Royal Game of Ur, and the Astrolabe. Plenty of shopping with very nice trinkets and gifts. I will return again!",Must see
"September 22, 2019","One of the most beautiful museums I've ever been to. It's free, organized and clean. The Egyptian and Greek collections are impressive. ",Amazing Throughout.
"September 22, 2019",This place is a must see. We were amazed with everything. We could have spent a week in here but only had a few hours.,British Museum visit
"September 22, 2019","My visit to the British Museum was to see the Rosetta Stone.  I was not disappointed!  Due to limited time available, I saw the highlights that were outlined in the official brochure.  The Assyrian Lion Hunt display was brilliant and I would say be sure to spend time looking at this remarkable piece of art work.  Highly recommend this museum.",Make a day of it
"September 22, 2019","We spent the day in London and decided to come here. We left our bags in the cloakroom, the charge was dependant on weight - is this a London thing??? It cost £7.50 for two bags.  There were lots of visitors present but as the building is so large no area was crowded.  The building was very clean. There are some sections that are free and others where there is a charge. We visited the areas without charge including the Egyptian mummies which was extremely fascinating. The shop we visited had a wide range of unique products including jewellery, crystals and soft furnishing. It was like an exhibition itself. I really feel you could spend the whole day here which is what we will do in the future. ",Must visit 
"September 21, 2019",It's very nice and historical but it is very crowded and noisy. Not very comfortable for people on the spectrum There should be some sort of wall isolation to fix that issue ,Always fun
"September 21, 2019","Always something to seeLove strolling around and check everything outSome free history lessons, always good no?",Impressive Collection
"September 20, 2019","Housed vast collection of artefacts collected during the British Empire. I was particularly drawn to the Greek, Roman & Egypt collection. I was also surprised to see a Pompeii section. The internal circular architecture is impressive. ",Don't miss this
"September 20, 2019","We traveled in early September, after the summer rush and before college students arrived in London, so there were no lines and it wasn't over crowded. We spent about 3-1/2 hours there, but you could spend days. It is one of the world's big 4 museums. Don't miss this if you're in London.",Loved it
"September 27, 2019",Wow. Fantastic exhibits. The building itself is an astounding piece of architecture. Love that entrance is free. An iconic piece of London and of civilization. A must see.,"So much to see, too many people"
"September 27, 2019","This is my third visit here and I really enjoyed catching up with some of the exhibits I hadn’t had time to discover on earlier visits. Great presentation but slightly spoiled by large, noisy school groups but good to see young ones appreciating history. Still a must go to place when in London.","Brilliant, Myriad & Infinite collection"
"September 27, 2019","So how does one review a museum -	That goes on and on and on with myriad and infinite collection-	That has collection of things that are thousands and thousands of years old – from mummies to bath tubs-	That has brilliant display techniques in terms of placement, lighting, anecdotes, et al-	That is brilliantly organized among plethora of sections across different floors-	That has huge central area with natural light, book stores and café and what not-	That is totally free, 7 days a week (from 10am to 5.30pm including Sundays)- especially when most attractions in UK cost a fortune. -	That can take up to a day or more to see everything that is on offer -	That is brilliant place to teach your kids a thing or two.Must visit place in London – especially with kids. Take some time to go there – may be 3-4 hours.",Awesome!
"September 26, 2019","Wonderful museum! I think this is my third favorite museum, after Louvre and New York Met. If you really enjoy a place like this then better be ready to spend some hours here, there is so much to see! Lots of details, information, and why not? Adventure and a feeling of nostalgia and wonder just by seeing how great this world and its people are! So much worth the visit! Enjoy!",Always a crowd pleaser
"September 26, 2019","It's a great place. Certainly draws the crowds, well it is the British Museum! Stunning exhibitions.But, there are London museums that provide better signage. ",Incredible History!
"September 26, 2019","I did not really know what this tour was about, but it was on the London Pass so we went.  Wow, how cool was this place!  We were able to see the Royal Jewels and to hear an amazing tour by one of the Beef Eaters.  This is an important piece of British History and is a beautiful place as well.  Make sure to walk along the Thames River and get some shots of the Tower Bridge!",So much to see!
"September 26, 2019","The British Museum is an extensive collection. There is so much to see, we could have spent all day here from open to close in order to see it all, but we had to keep it shorter than that due to our other plans. It is laid out well, with lots of room to maneuver through the exhibits. That was good, because it was very busy. I enjoyed this museum a lot and would definitely return to explore it further when I have another chance.",Bible tour
"September 26, 2019","Incredible artifacts that take you back in time . Well worth a visit, even if you are not a history lover.",Treasures of the world 
"September 26, 2019",It was amazing to see so many fabulous displays. I particularly liked the European and Egyptian displays. I hope they return the Rosetta Stone one day. ,World class but way too hard to manage
"September 25, 2019","This is one of the world's great museums.  One cannot give it a rating less than 5 stars.  So as a museum, 5 STARS.  But it is a real pain to get anything done there.  We visited in September 2019.  It was not terribly crowded but when people think they should take minutes doing a video on an inanimate object, one after another, it becomes way too hard to see anything.  We watched people walking around, up and down stairs, with their phone video going.  They ran into each other and it made the experience way too complicated.  We will go back but never during a time close to tourist season.",british museum
"September 20, 2019","The Rosetta Stone is displayed here, and it was incredible to see the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, Demotic script, and Greek script, something I learned about in middle school. We only had an hour here, so we visited the Greek Parthenon exhibit, and also saw Japanese samurai armor and the Royal Game of Ur. My sister stumbled across exhibits of the Tower of Babel and the Easter Island moai, which I was so bummed I missed.",Need to visit!
"September 20, 2019",Please reserve all day to discover most wonderful pieces of art from ancient Mesoptamia till today. I need to revisit because I haven't got enough tome to see it all. Must see!,"It's the British Museum, for heaven's sake!"
"September 20, 2019","This is one of those places that you need to visit again and again. The treasures (no matter what you think of the acquisition methods) are spectacular.We hit the highlights tour, but found ourselves distracted by the wealth of treasures.Go! They ask only for a donation!",Great Exhibits and a Great Exeprience
"September 20, 2019","We went early on a weekday morning. The security line was not too long and it went pretty smoothly. I was taking my Dad, and wanted to see the objects suggested for a 3 hour visit in the Museum website. Though the room numbers were given, it was pretty difficult to locate the objects in the room. A map with location in the room would be helpful. The crowd in front of the Rosetta Stone was huge, but the other objects were easily viewable. Overall, a great experince.",it's big...
"September 20, 2019","Had the chance to walk around for 1,5 hours after my business visit.Impressive, the huge Greek, Assyrian and Roman arefacts they present. I thought he rooms about early Britain were nice too. Entrance is free, but you are asked for a contribution quite stern... 5 pounds is ok",Amazing!!!!
"September 20, 2019",It’s huge and simply amazing Incredible collection A day is simply not enough Interesting temporary exhibitions as wellVery nice reasonably priced restaurant upstairs Don’t miss it!!!5/5,Great manga exhibit
"September 20, 2019","Liked the special exhibits, they were big and well curated. I loved the. A game Exhibit. Their permanent collection of Egyptian artifacts and caskets is really something. I wish the pricing for exhibits could be combined or was lower. It can get very high if you don’t have special tickets. ",Must Do
"September 19, 2019","This is a must do when in London. Make a day of the British Museum, VA Museum over the road. Easy access by Tube ",All sorts of Stuff 
"September 18, 2019","I’d loved another heap of hours, possibly a whole day to search out so much more than the snippet I saw. Wow. There is so much ancient history we do not have in Oz as we’re such a young country. ",An interesting journey
"September 18, 2019",The museum is very big and it is difficult for someone to see it in one day but it is worthing the time. There is a huge variety of exhibits from different ancient and current civilizations all over the world. It is amazing and worth seeing! ,Awesome
"September 15, 2019","If you enjoy museums, this one is fantastic. So much to see, it was difficult to pack it into one day. The Ancient Egypt section was fascinating, as were the exhibits on Ancient Rome. Many truly mind boggling, overwhelming artefacts to check out. Well worth a visit. Personal highlight was Lindow Man.",Loved this museum
"September 14, 2019",Lots of hidden gems in this huge museum.  You could spend a lot of time here and it is recommended to see all of the amazing artifacts.,"east,egypt, india"
"September 14, 2019","one of the most amazing museums in the world, history in its impressive aspect. huge monoments and importent exhibitions to history seekers and curious persons.",At least a 2-day trip
"September 14, 2019","We went there in a low season, mid September, the crowd was not too bad.  1.  The audio guide, I asked staff there, they whispered it was not necessary if you buy the guide book.  I found the description there with the exhibit explains well.  2.  The place was massive, i do suggest you research a effective route for yourself and priortorize your specific interest.  3. I spent 1.5 day there, I felt like i can spend more time there.  2-day may be necessary.4.  Many restaurants are nearby, you can go in & out.  Have lunch out there. No regret.  One of the places to visit for a lifetime.  ",Loot from my country on display here
"September 14, 2019","I am impressed by the fabulous collection of sculptures from my country here. But I want to know why are these treasures displayed in a British Museum? Why have they not returned these items to the former colonies who are the rightful inheritors of these items. I am sure Greeks, Chinese, Egyptians, Syrians, Iraqis etc etc feel the same way",An absolute must see.
"September 14, 2019","This wonderful collection takes hours to appreciate.  I was thrilled to stand next to the Rosetta Stone.  Too many fabulous things to take in on one visit.  And, allow plenty of time or you'll miss so much.",So much to see!
"September 13, 2019","Because of the British empire, so many different cultures are represented - and some that were not part of the British empire.  Parthenon exhibit particularly interesting as is the Rosetta Stone.",See the highlights in the best museum in the world?
"September 13, 2019",I didn't have much time so this is what I advise if you're in the same situation. Buy the £2 map which has the top 10 items to see in 1 hour! This will not only ensure you see the Rosetta stone and the Elgin marbles but will ensure you go all over the museum to get a taste of what is there so you can spend longer next time. Really you could be there for a week and not see it all! Be aware you have to queue for security. Good places to eat everywhere and a fabulous shop. Enjoy!! ,Amazing artifacts
"September 12, 2019",An absolutely stunning array of items from so many cultures and history. The preservation of items that would have been destroyed in their original location allows all to enjoy the beauty of ancient civilizations.,Just OK.
"September 11, 2019","Like the Smithsonian museums in the US, you can only take so much.  Maybe an audio  or tour guide would have made it more interesting.",British Museum
"September 9, 2019",One of the best places we visited.  Had artifacts from all over the world including mummy's.  Went in the early morning before it got crowded.  There is alot of history there.,"Wonderful place to go and free, my very favourite price!"
"September 9, 2019",I went on a Bible tour where we followed the ancient Assyrians and their drama.  We were a group of around 20 from England Ireland and Holland ages from in the pushchair to over 60.,Allow lots of time.
"September 9, 2019","An excellent place to visit.  I wish we had had more time.  One could spend days here. We did a quick walkthrough the Ancient Egyptian, Ancient Assyrian and Ancient Greece is exhibits. Quite interesting. ",Very Busy
"September 8, 2019","Busy, bustling museum with plenty to see.Might be best to plan ahead and decide what you really want to see.Food and drink like most museums in London is pricey but then entry is free.You will have your own favourite sections in the museums, given its central location and ease of visit, well worth taking a look for both overseas visitors and day trippers alike.",HUGE and amazing
"September 8, 2019",There is seriously not enough time to see everything in that museum. One of the most captivating collections of ancient artifacts from so many civilizations I have ever seen in my life. Do yourself a favor and dedicate a day to it. You will not regret it. ,Just wonderful
"September 7, 2019",Between the amount of rooms to go into and the vast selection was amazing to see. The signs around the museum are very informative. Also the staff can point you to what you want to see when you ask them. Looking forward to another visit there.,So much to see!
"September 7, 2019",Went to the British Museum in June with my mom and teenage daughter. It is so big that you really have to plan for it. We allotted about 2-3 hours and we barely scratched the surface. You can easily make a day of it if you want to but we were already tired from other site seeing. There is the cutest little tea shop directly across the street for a rest and some great afternoon tea. It rained which only made the atmosphere perfect London! Will go back!,Huge
"September 7, 2019",What a huge place. So interesting for history buffs. It covers such a various part of history its amazing. Overwhelming. I would advise to go twice and divide the time because it can be a lot to take in especially for teens. Don't miss it. ,Wonderful 
"September 7, 2019",An amazing place.  We took an Egypt introduction tour and were not disappointed.  Very interesting for the whole family ,Great tour that gave the highlights
"September 7, 2019","The British Museum has huge collections, which while wondering could be overwhelming especially for people with limited time. Our guide, Becky,did a terrific job giving us a high level overview of the history of the museum and then took us through the highlights. Becky was enthusiastic and resourceful. At the end of the tour, we felt that time just flew by and we learned so much. Thank you for a truly wonderful experience, Becky!",Beautiful museum
"September 7, 2019","Beautiful museum! When we first arrived on the premises, we were quite shocked at how long the line extended outside. Although it looked daunting, the line moved very quickly and we were in the museum in no time. In addition, because the museum is so massive, it wasn't too crowded",Where Are We
"September 7, 2019",Great and interesting exhibits if you can find your way around. Mapping unclear and difficult to understand ,History for days
"September 7, 2019",I went on a solo trip to the museum and thoroughly enjoyed myself. I did like the fact that there were chairs you could carry around with you inside the museum. Food was obviously a little bit more pricier but that was expected. The toilets were clean especially since there were multiple tour buses of visitors that came in all at once. There were heaps of tourists but that was expected given that it is Summer holidays. I enjoyed the history and being able to see all of the wonders the ancient world had to offer ,What an awesome museum!
"September 6, 2019",My sister and I visited the British Museum while visiting London. The admission is free but they do take donations. We strolled around for an hour or two. My favorite exhibit (and probably the most famous) was the Rosetta Stone. There is a security check point that takes maybe 20 minutes to get through. I am sure this varies by the day and time. ,Wonderful museum
"September 6, 2019",This was spectacular museum! We hardly saw any of it. Would like to return for more. There were traveling exhibits as well as permanent. ,The museum
"September 6, 2019",Well organized. Nothing to say about Neive points. Don't miss the Rosetta stone and the pantheon area.,Great miseum
"September 6, 2019","Free admission is unbelievable. Great collection with cafes, shops and sitting areas if you’re tired.","Doorway to human history, art and culture!"
"September 5, 2019","Its permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence, having been widely sourced during the era of the British EmpireThe Museum holds the largest collection of Egyptian objects outside Egypt. Highlights include the Rosetta Stone, a 5,000 year old sand-dried mummy, wall paintings from Nebamun’s tomb and sculptures of Ramesses II.",Amazing!
"September 4, 2019",So many things to see at the museum and so little time. I enjoyed looking through the different expositions and learning about their history.,British Pride.
"September 4, 2019",This is pride for British people. Every British should visit this place once in their life. Highly recommend.,Breath taking
"September 4, 2019","The huge space, the main hull  and the big variety of both permanent and temporary exhibition makes you loosing time and continue to wonder around  ",World Wide artifacts of different eras
"September 4, 2019","This museum is very big, so give yourself time probabbly 5 to 6 hours going at a good pace. It has different shops, coffee shops, restaurants and bathrooms through out the building. Sundays is free entrance and you find lots of tourists and locals incoming from the time the museum opens. Very well put with permanent and itinerant exhibits.",One of the Best Museums
"September 4, 2019","The British Museum is one of the best museums I've visited. It is huge so plan no less than half a day so that you don't rush. There is simply a lot to take in. If you're visiting during the high tourist season, go as early in the day as you can to avoid as much of the crowd as you can. Ideally go after the summer season, although I understand there are still crowds, just not as overwhelming. The Museum is on our list when we go back. ",Could spend all day here
"September 4, 2019",There was a line for bag check but moves fast.  There so much to see I didn't cover it all in 3hrs.  I ate there & had an English Tea.  It was good plus as others said I considered it a donation since its free to see unless you want give 5 pound donation but I say save your money and eat there.  I didn't get a map but I should have gotten one because I wonder thru the same areas several times.   I some how missed the center of museum but enjoyed it alot.  Go see it,Absolutely amazing
"September 4, 2019","The British Museum is huge. I didn't have time to look round everything. There was a Roman section with statues of Roman Emperors, an Egyptian section, all different sections from different times in history. The antique jewellry was amazing. The building itself is an arcitectural masterpiece.","AMAZING, do not miss!!!"
"September 4, 2019",Anyone even remotely interested in history should check it out! I mean it’s free! You could spend days here looking at all the artifacts. I would very highly recommend checking it out and spend as much time as you feel compelled to!,All this and it's FREE! Don't miss it.
"September 4, 2019","What an amazing collection of artifacts from almost every part of the world spanning almost all of time. You could spend days here and still not really take it all in.Everything is very well laid out and displayed with great detail, the write ups have a good amount of info without going into too much detail. It's just incredible how much is here, there truly is something for everyone. Though the circumstances of the appropriation of many things is questionable we are lucky that they did as much wouldn't have survived back where they came from and that it is all provided without an entry fee makes the history attainable to anyone who wants to see it.",Amazing artifacts
"September 3, 2019",Other than the fact that many of the most amazing artifacts were stolen from Egypt this place is full of amazing history. I’m sure Egypt is sorry they gave this all away for nothing but it is surely England’s gain.,Amazing Spectacle
"September 3, 2019",Amazing things to look at.  Leave hours to see it all (like 4-5 hours) especially with the crowds. Very eclectic selection AND it's free!!!!Was a little warm for this American in summer but not unbearable.,Really neat interior architecture
"September 3, 2019","So i wasn't necessarily here for the exhibits. I was photographing the interior (just look at the ceiling!) with my brother and came up with some interesting patterns/compositions. Really liked it. I have only heard great reviews about the exhibits, so will have to visit this museum again for that next time.Well worth it.",Amazing
"August 31, 2019","I tried to visit the British Museum at least every other trip to London. Their standing exhibits are nothing short of extraordinary and  rival just about every other antiquities exhibit.  In terms of their ancient Egypt collections I have only seen one other better than this.....I recommend everyone visit the Egyptian museum in Turin, Italy.",It´s good but London has better to offer
"August 30, 2019","Don´t get me wrong, this museum has the best collection of historic artefacts from around the world, but for me it feels like it´s too big and too crowded,",A place for History seekers
"August 30, 2019","There are a variety of things to see here, from Egyptian tombs to Greek artefacts and from Indian pillars to Roman sculptures. I would not suggest this if you have a young kid as our little was bored but the adults in our group enjoyed. There was something for everyone.",Very Nice
"August 30, 2019","Very Nice and Big museum with restaurants and souvenir shops to cafes.Lastly, the museum had a lot of greek and egyptian",Worth the wait!

"August 29, 2019",#1 place to visit in London. So much to see we ran out of time and will make a poiunt of visiting again next time,Worth the line-up
"August 28, 2019","Great museum with historic pieces on display. Sutton Hoo treasure & Pattern welded crucible steel sword found in the boat burial is an unbelievable item considering the steel technology used to make sword wasn’t known in Britain again until 1800’s. The Rosetta Stone, Lewis Chessmen & Fine Artworks make it worth the wait in a queue that stretches out the entry gate & down the footpath outside.",So much to see
"August 28, 2019",This is an amazing museum. Free to enter (they would like a small donation) so a cheap day out. You need to plan what you want to see as there just so many exhibits too review. Something for everyone regardless of age. Recommended,best museum in London
"August 27, 2019","I  enjoyed going to this place, I am planning  to visit this place again during  my few days vacation  in London ",Exquisite!
"August 27, 2019",This is the type of museum that you need a month to see everything. My main focus due to time constraints was the Egyptiania and it did not disappoint!   A truly glorious exhibit!,One of the most comprehensive museums I've ever visited
"September 3, 2019","One of the most comprehensive museums I've ever visited. The museum is huge, you need 4 to 5 hours to explore every section. Their iconic glass dome is beautiful and put some artsy touch to the building.They have Egyptian mummies, modern artifacts, Easter Island's statue, you name it! Avoid weekend and holiday because it can get very crowded.",Loved it!
"September 2, 2019","You need 3 to 4 hours to enjoy this. All I can say is I could have spent 8 hours here. Take your time to ensure you do not miss anything that is on display. The history is outstanding . Very easy to get around, well laid out. ",Amazing 
"September 2, 2019",I am Greek and 50% of the museum has Greek art. You should return the sculptures back to Greece. Also there is art from other countries ,"Amazing exhibits, a must-see in London!"
"September 2, 2019","This was my first visit to the museum and I wish I could have stayed all day. We went mainly to see the Egyptian collection which didn’t disappoint but the other collections were very good as well. Amazing to see the Rosetta Stone in particular, that was the real highlight for me.",Worlds histories artefacts are to be found here
"September 2, 2019",Spacious museum with wonderful artefacts plenty of things on ancient Rome and Egypt but also from the Arabic world and wonder Asian cups made  of shells,Very exciting - as always

"September 1, 2019","It’s a great museum to visit because of their extensive collections, from Greek artifacts to Egyptian mummies. You can spend a whole day here if you visit everything but if they have listed the highlights if you have a very limited time. Best of all, entrance is free! Don’t get discouraged if you see a queue outside, it’s just for security check. ",World class museum
"September 1, 2019","Free admission to a hugely impressive building with fabulous roof to the Great Court.  With so much to see, August is definitely a month to avoid as its incredibly busy, but worth it.

"August 31, 2019","This place is huge and has so much history from mummies to the Rosetta Stone. It offers so much as each one of our kids had something on their list they wanted to see there. We didn’t have the whole day to spend there, but will have to go back next time we’re in London. ",Whole world under one roof!
"August 31, 2019",architecture from outside is impressive enough but inside much better. The representative photo is where you stay at entry. There were a lot of historical pieces also from Anatolia (Turkey) and Persia which of course interested me most. Also ancient Egypt was impressive. What i didn't like was there were too much restaurants inside and the open kitchen created a lot of smell. This can be solved in better way I think.,Brilliant
"August 25, 2019","What a wonderful experience.  Do as many have recommended and be there before the opening (10am). You can get inside the museum proper, get your audio guide and simply wait outside gallery 4 (with others) to race to see the Rosetta Stone. However, the time saved in waiting for an endless line and the lack of crowds just beyond the main attraction are well worth the early arrival.  So many great objects to see and learn about!",British museum
"August 24, 2019","The time spent at the security checks at the entrance can be reduced if you don’t have backpacks or large hand bags . You can purchase a map of the building or pick up one with a voluntary donation inside the entrance. There is a guide to essential exhibits to see if your time is limited ,less than 3 hours,i.e Rosetta Stone etc. Good lighting throughout and explanatory plaques in several languages near exhibits.A wonderful experience without an entrance fee.",Unique exhibits of different cultures under one roof!
"August 24, 2019","Admire magnificent artifacts, travel through centuries and countries. One day is definitely not enough! A must for everyone visiting the UK! The refreshments are an excellent idea and the gift shop offers great variety.",Crowded but worth it. 
"August 24, 2019","I always love the British Museum. I entered through the Montague St entrance, it is less known and faster than the Great Russel St entrance. The wow factor of this museum is a 10! I always start at the top and work my way down. I always take 2 days to enjoy this museum. I did not see everything. The Egyptian mummies are always impressive but the room is always overly warm. I am guessing the artifacts need the temperature and the hordes of people. Be patient so you can fully enjoy the amazing collection.The Japanese Collection was more impressive that I first thought, the Rothschild Collection is just wow. I needed an extra day to fully appreciate it. One aspect of the museum I REALLY appreciate is that when you enter a new room they highlight some of the more well known, important pieces with a picture so you can identify them. Take your time and enjoy this museum.",Free Entry - worth a visit
"August 23, 2019",One of the free things to do in London! It’s worth a visit. There are so many things to learn. They provide free guided tour. Visit their website for timings. I recommend this place while you are in London.,One of the Biggest Collections I have seen
"August 23, 2019","One could spend days at the British Museum. Audio guides are great.  There are some short guided tours.  The one we took on ancient Rome was good and interesting, but very hard to hear the guide.  She was too quiet. Since the museum is free, you might want to consider going more than once.  Loved ancient Rome and Egypt exhibits.  Would have liked to seen more. We did have to wait in line more than 30 min to get in the building.  It gets very busy in the summer, especially when it rains.",A great Collection
"August 23, 2019","One of the top Museums in the world, filled with very good artifacts that tells world history. You have to plan well before your visit and you must do more than one visit. But they will all be worth it. I visited the Munch Prints exhibition and it was incredibly good.",Crash course in Archeology - Development of Mankind
"August 22, 2019","A 5hour + tour that guided us through the earliest humanoid finds in Aftrica,, Europe, Asia and the Middle East and the advancement through Egyptian, Greek and Roman times.. After a brief lunch break we were exposed to early European eras that included the Viking and Saxon presence in early England, Scotland and Ireland with a finale in South America where Axtec and Inca periods were briefly visited.  Our guide was well spoken Irish Archeologist - well worth the long day...(made our PM Pub Visit all the more appreciated!",Interesting Museum
"August 22, 2019","We spend half a day there and be prepared to walk and walk and walk. Best of all, it is free entrance and seek donation if you wish to contribute. Worth while going for it. Be warn of the crowd. ",great museum but a bit too crowded
"August 22, 2019","The British museum is a must see, be prepared for the crowds and heat. While this wasn't our first visit to the museum, it was our shortest. We unfortunately picked a busy summer afternoon, it was really too hot and crowded to enjoy much. We visited the Egyptian collection and then left. ( excellent collection)","One of the ""Jewels in our Crown"""
"August 19, 2019","If you do nothing else while in London, you should visit  even if only to see the Oxus hoard and the Sutton Hoo treasures. There is then about another 200,000 things to wonder at from Egyptian mummies to modern coins - including lots and lots of things ""acquired"" when we English  ruled about 25% of the world. ",Tea and cake
"August 18, 2019","Amazing location but really busy and noisy and a bit expensive for two teas and a brownie (£9), it is central London 5hough 8 suppose and the staff were friendly. ","Mesmerising, treat for history and antique lovers"
"August 18, 2019","If you like museums, this is very best of them. Can easily spend full day here. Egypt section with Mummies is on top of my list.",Elgin Marbles
"August 18, 2019","On a vacation from the US, we stopped in here on a busy Sunday and enjoyed the Elgin Marbles as well as the Rosetta stone! Can't beat the price.",Family break
"August 18, 2019","Due to weather our plans changed so only had a short trip. But luckily we got in quick, had a quick look at the central area then a few lower levels. With not much time a member of staff showed us some of the highlights and talked through these to our kids. Very interesting, kids loved it. Defiantly first on list on next visit. Even the wife wants to go back. ",Unable to visit because of security checking queue
"August 18, 2019",Wanted to visit the British Museum for first time in years but when we arrived the queue to go in must have been over 500m and showing little sign of moving. Need to sort out the security checking.,Family
"August 18, 2019","Amazing place. If you are interested in history, this is the place. You had best be comfortable in crowds though, because this place is extraordinarily busy. Thousands of visitors will be sharing your experience.  Worth it, in my mind 🙂",Interesting but crowded
"August 18, 2019","The crowds were the first thing we noticed. It was summer school vacation so the lines at opening time we're horrendous. Having said that, I was really impressed at the speed with which the people were moved inside. The galleries where the Egyptian statues etc were held was a nightmare mainly due to large numbers of tour groups appearing to be mainly from one world region. They are generally interested only in their own agenda and unlike many others, ignorant of consideration for the rest of the people in the area. The displays are first rate and once you leave the more popular sections there is adequate room for viewing. The museum shop is extremely well stocked and the prices reasonable.The cafeteria is also very good and has reasonable pricing.",Treasures
"August 18, 2019","We came for husband who wanted to see the Sutton Hoo treasures and we weren’t disappointed. It’s pretty amazing. For me they need better ventilation as the rooms were busy, hot and stuffy. Plus the long queue for the ladies down stone smelly stairs was a low point!It would take you days to see everything, so we’ll return in the winter on a quieter day.",Great activity for all ages
"August 18, 2019","We have to keep coming back because we just can’t fit it all in. So much to see which keeps the interest of children, and adults of all ages. It’s a great place for a rainy day in London, it’s free and educational and has exhibits you won’t see anywhere else. We love the Egyptian mummies and the Easter Island statue. There is always something new to discover on every visit. The cafe has a great selection of cakes and drinks although is on the pricy side, especially painful if you have a large family. ",Excellent special exhibitions -- Munch (last days) and Rembrandt -- Good accessibility
"August 11, 2019",This is a substantial museum with a major collection and excellent temporary exhibits.  It is also easy to access for disabled people.  There are reserved parking spaces and a ramp at the entrance.  Lifts to upper floors.,Amazing museum and free
"August 11, 2019","Wow this museum is amazing. Now it’s not as big as the Louvre in Paris, but this will take you at least half a day to look through everything, plus it’s FREE. Clean and if you come in the morning, you can avoid the crowds.",A visit to learn
"August 11, 2019",It was so interesting to visit the museum. You can see and learn a lot. But you need to go to the museum earlier as it takes some time to enter. Keep in mind that it takes a whole day to examine every exhibition,Not worth it
"August 10, 2019","It was the hottest day of the summer in London so we decided to find activities that had air conditioning. The British Museum seemed to be a good choice.  I lasted all of 10 minutes and had to call it a day. Firstly, the museum seemed sort of run down although it was hard to see much given the seemingly hundreds of tour groups traipsing through the museum which was the second problem.  There were so many tour groups that it was impossible to see any of the displays and difficult to walk around the museum. The attractions weren't impressive enough to make it worth dealing with the crowds so I would skip this one. ",Manga exhibition!
"August 10, 2019","Visited the British Museum for the manga exhibition and an exclusive showing of studio Ghibli’s the wind rises! We spent the whole day going round the manga exhibition and exploring the other areas of the museum, took us all day! Such a great day out for families and couples, would definitely recommended going! We did have to pay for the manga exhibition meaning we skipped the security bag queue which was ridiculously long so make sure you arrive early! ",A must see
"August 9, 2019","This is of course amazing, but please consider putting some sort of traffic direction on the Rosetta Stone as they do, for example,  at the Tower for the Crown Jewels; at the moment, it's impossible to view it in any detail without hords of  photo-snapping ****** getting in the way. On that topic, I was gobsmacked to see someone get excited about a stunning piece, but rather than look at it 'in the flesh', they took a photo and then showed that to hs friend and then got excited about the image!! ",Fabulous - but don't go on a rainy day in the tourist season!
"August 9, 2019","I have lost count of the number of times I've spent many hours at a time at the British Museum and there is still more to see. It is a wonderful repository of international history which is truly awesome. However, I would advise avoiding busy times if possible.On my last visit it was a very wet day and I felt the museum was very overcrowded - it was completely impossible to see the Rosetta Stone for example! People posing for photos and the use of selfie-sticks didn't help.The number of visitors also meant huge queues for food, drink and the shop. Nevertheless it is an absolute must for Londoners, UK visitors and overseas visitors. Fabulous!",3rd floor in The British Museum
"August 9, 2019",Ir is so wide show of human history and also contemporary items that one could use days in this venue. I focused this time to 3rd floor only - seeing the times fron ancient Egypt and Mesopotania to European Enlightment. Free entry is making this a very popular venue to visit.,Travel the world and back in time 
"August 9, 2019","I arrived at the museum at 11:30, only an hour and a half after opening and the museum was already packed as you would expect. There was a helpful member of staff at the main entrance towards the back of a rather long entry queue who said it would be quicker to get into the building via the back entrance-this is on Montague Place. It appeared the main reason for queuing was for bag checks though no bags were looked through so everyone just went right in. I would recommend taking a free map of the building and firstly scouting for your preferred areas of interest. You could quite easily spend several days here and still not have seen everything so find what you most want to check out and then look at everything at a leisurely pace. I did not do a tour on this occasion but this may be something I do in the future as I am sure it would allow for more of the museum to be seen in a day. I was here for several hours enjoying the permanent pieces and free exhibits. There were some areas which felt a lot like a sauna. Unfortunately the only option for cool air were some large fans in the corner of rooms and with the amount of people there as you can imagine, especially on a hot day in August it was necessary to take a few breaks standing in front of the fans. My favourite sections were all the rooms about east Asia (so much ceramic), the Middle East including Ancient Egypt and Prints and Drawings. Don’t forget to check out the King’s Library. I enjoyed the free exhibitions about Captain James Cook and his voyages. This closed on 4th August 2019. I would highly recommend the museum to anyone who loves to learn about history, art, different cultures and loves jewellery- there was plenty to see. One tip- take plenty of water.  Another visit in the pipeline to explore more of what was missed. ",Amazing visit!!!
"August 8, 2019",Had such an incredible day with my daughter. We walked our socks off all over the museum and were sad when they actually closed and kicked us out lolThe investigation exhibit was absolutely incredible- we spent 2 hours in there alone. Go into the garden and have a peek at the plants and pond! Beautiful. Food is overpriced which was expected but would recommend packed lunch if you don’t want to spend your pay check on chocolate brownies and lattes!!Can’t wait to go again!,Amazing!
"August 7, 2019",Free museum! Just say yes. If you love mummies and world history this is the museum for you. You could spend an entire day here but I recommend at least 3 hours. Bring water. You can't bring food or drink into the exhibits but you can always refill a bottle at the water fountain. The food is expensive but it was tasty.,Visit the Mummies
"August 7, 2019",Awesome showcase of antiquities from all over the world.This is a real treasure trove! I can spend all day there.,History of the world in 100 objects!
"August 7, 2019","The collection is so vast -- and they do an excellent job of presenting everything.  There is something for everyone (all ages, all interests).  If you get tired of reading, you can do a ""hands on"" experience (the money room offered one of these).  Or, take one of the ""pop up"" tours (given by volunteers) -- check with the information desk near the entrance.  Or, if you have time, do one of the extensive audio tours.  I spent 2 full days here, and could easily spend two weeks without getting tired!  (By the way, entrance is free!!! -- but they do encourage a modest contribution to allay costs..)",It’s a must
"August 7, 2019","If you visit London, The British Museum must definitely be on your to-do list. It’ s amazing how many things from all over the world you can see.",The largest museum in the world
"August 7, 2019",Probably the largest museum in the world. One needs at least a week for visiting the important galleries.,Beautiful museum
"August 7, 2019",The museum is a must when visiting London. We went on a Sunday and the the lines were not too bad. The exhibits are fascinating and well organized. The central area of the museum gets quite crowded so be prepared.,Great Afternoon Outing
"August 7, 2019","Fun looking through the history and art of UK.  The museum was very busy but that was ok.  Staff very helpful, you could disappear inside the museum for days.  So much to see ",Too popular for its own good
"August 7, 2019",So difficult to get in.. what are all these people doing? The displays lack information.. I went to see the Solomon show.. disappointed.. saw more in the main exhibit in the big hall. The Chinese gallery now has removed the fabulous Burmese and Thai and Sri Lankan.. oh I know the excuses.I could go on.. so sad . The BM was 40 years ago a wonder house.not any more,Wonderful collection of artefacts
"August 6, 2019",Spent a couple of hours and probably only covered half the museum. I love history and classics and this was just the job. Lovely ambience but navigating between the exhibits can be a challenge. Recommend taking the map so you know where you want to go. Lovely cafe in the old reading room area.,British museum
"August 6, 2019",We have been to the British museum every time we go toLondon as t is one of our favourites. This time we decided to skip the Elgin marbles and Egyptian section. The regular collection is quite interesting and we had a wonderful time.,Exceptional but not British...
"July 30, 2019",There is no doubt that the British museum is an exceptional one but there is not a variety of exhibitions about Britain's history.  Most of the exhibitions are from Greece and Egypt . In general the museum is big and there is no entrance fee. You can donate an amount of money if you'd like. ,Best Museum
"July 30, 2019",Absolutely amazing museum!  You can't go to London with a stop here!  Treasures from all over the world!,Enjoyed - long overdue
"July 30, 2019","Despite 10 plus visits to London, never had the time to visit the British museum. Nice place to spend 3-4 hours - good central place to view things found in museums of Greece, Egypt and Rome. Suggest you focus on 10 most important items first and if you are not tired of walking approach other exhibits.",History of whole world is in your hands
"July 30, 2019",The museum is huge - it will take a week to see everything - history of whole world is in your hands. The upper floors are narrower and overcrowded. Gift-shops has a great selection of souvenirs and gifts. Admission is free.,Always a delight!
"July 30, 2019","This museum never fails to delight and astonish. We love the written descriptions of each exhibit that are missing in other places such as the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The only failure is the cafes lack any gluten free options and for drinks, there is no such thing as an ice cube in ",Manga Exhibition
"July 30, 2019","After a full day in London, my partner and I ventured to the British Museum to take a look at their manga exhibition and what it has to offer. As an avid manga reader, I was excited to see what they have in store for us. From the start straight to the finish this was jam-packed with everything manga to the origin story of manga to modern-day production and the top mangas at the moment. I will highly recommend this to anyone who reads manga as you can spend a while in here reading all the information they have to offer.",Incredible museum with about a week's worth of stuff!
"July 29, 2019",We did the highlights tour as that was all we had time for. The highlights tour is very recommended--it gives you insider knowledge and appreciation of about 10-12 different items around the museum. I could come back and visit this museum every day for an entire week. Maybe I will have to do just that!,Probably the best museum in the world
"July 29, 2019","This is probably the best museum in the world. It's sheer scale rivals that of the Louvre but it is much easier to get around, much better designed and free for everyone to enter!It's worth noting that the BM (in the past) has been accused of acquiring its collections using less than legal methods, so a moral question remains of whether to support the institution. ",My Favorite Museum 
"July 29, 2019",What a treat: a free Museum of international acclaim.I headed to the Egyptian displays on 2 floors and could have spent a week looking at everything.Do not miss going to the museum.,The history of the Western World under one roof
"July 29, 2019","Loved this museum, massive collections, the Rosetta Stone is a must see, fantastic objects, well presented",I like to visit museum
"July 23, 2019",I would like to visit museum in every country because i love museum of the every country i have visited,"Vast, Yet Managable"
"July 22, 2019","My adult son and I spent a very pleasant late afternoon here, both looking at exhibits and enjoying the cafe. Most memorable is the beautiful enclosed courtyard. As many others must mention, note there is not much indigenous to Britain itself. Still a great collection and worth your time.",Plenty to see
"July 22, 2019","Had a lovely time visiting this museum. They had alot of things to see and I enjoyed it. If visiting, spend the whole day and you can walk around","Go with a plan, and it will be great."
"July 22, 2019","You should definitely figure out what you're interested in at the British Museum before you go. It is a massive museum and you'll be over it after about an hour or two, so pick out the exhibits you want to see and do them first! For example, I wanted to see the Rosetta Stone first. I suggest going at off-peak times because people are everywhere and it is really packed.",Amazingness never ends and jaw-dropping exhibition in every section!
"July 22, 2019","Was staying in a hostel right next to the museum, making it super convenient to visit the place from time to time. Not only that I enjoy the in-door exhibitions a lot, but I was also amazed by the outdoor exhibition activities during the weekend. The only pity was that I never get to finish going through all exhibition rooms... There are simply too many to see!",Make a selection before you go in
"July 22, 2019",With over 8 million pieces it's impossible to see all of it. My advise for a half day visit would be to select one section. I selected the Egyptian section and was surprised at the amount of statues that you can get close to without any glass encasing. Some top pieces are protected but most are very open. Entering the museum was quick even though nowadays there is a security check. The entrance is free. Donations are welcomed. Tip if you want to fast-track; buy a ticket to special exposition and you have a shorter line to get in on busy days.,Just awesome 
"July 22, 2019"," Came primarily to see the Rosetta Stone, but then got absorbed by the Greek, Roman, Egyptian wing as a whole, just wonderful.There was a pamphlet justifying the holding for part of the Freise from the Parthenon as the Greek Govt are claiming it back, and we found their reasoning a little weak and self serving.Only other downside was the huge number of people attending but that is to be expected, just take your time and go with the flow.",Spent a memorable day at the British Museum
"July 22, 2019",Had an amazing day just wondering through the museum. No planning and just a walkthrough. Went to see the special Edvard Munch exhibit and it was so nice to see the SCREAM.,"If you love history, this place is best to find out more"
"July 21, 2019","I am honestly not a mueseum person.Hence , not much comments. Well maintained place. Lot of places to eat inside. Lot of benches to sit and take rest for a while. Guides to explain. Washroom on all floors.Helpful and courteous staff.",Great family day out
"July 21, 2019",Museum quickly got us through security check. For a Sunday it was relatively quiet and we went straight into the specialist exhibitions. Manga - Great stuff we all enjoyed. By 2pm it was busy but the catering served us quickly and food was excellent. Engaged staff who were very helpful. Got tickets to see another exhibition and afterwards went and looked round Japan exhibits. All really interesting. Exhibit rooms nicely cooled on a warm day. Left at closing time having had a great day.,Amazing museum 
"July 20, 2019","We only managed to spend a couple of hours here but could easily spend 2 days! The exhibitions are interesting and informative on a large scale, so much to see especially with the special exhibitions in summer on as well. Highly recommend it but perhaps allow a longer time for the visit. It is very crowded with tourists however still worth visiting.","How can you not make this a ""5"" - well, pick better times to go"
"July 20, 2019","July afternoon 2019 - packed like sardines would be an understatement.  Being a ""rude Yank"", I actually ended up pushing some people out of the way so a guy in a blow command wheel chair could see the Rosetta Stone ...That said, it is a great experience.  However, go very early in the AM, go in January or February, go anytime the crowds are not there.  There is a ""90 minute"" tour for the top 10 highlights so I'd start with that (mapped out on the guide) and then come back to the places of your interest.",Great Historical Museum
"July 19, 2019",We really enjoyed this museum all about London.  We had the London Pass so we received a free catalog booklet which has lots of references of the museum.  It’s easy to get around and nicely done.  If you have time take the kids there as well.   Dry helpful staff.  There’s an eatery there and you can get bottled water for a reasonable price.  ,Stunning collection 
"July 19, 2019",We visited with our daughters. Our focus was primarily Greco-Roman; Egyptian and Mayan. We were not disappointed. Clearly one of the worlds great museums. First it is free although contributions are constantly being solicited. The collections are the best primarily the Egyptian and Greco-Roman. The layout can be overwhelming but the employees are more than ready to help. They also have very knowledgeable volunteers that conduct tours of sections. Just plan accordingly as the schedules vary by section. Certainly one of the reasons to visit London. ,Must see
"July 19, 2019",Such a great museum!  I find this easy to go into and see what I want- or dig deeper in a section.  I think it is laid out so much better than the Louve and other museums.,Stunning building
"July 19, 2019","Was there only for a couple of hours. This places needs more like a couple of days to explore.  Went to the Egyptian section for one of the largest collection of mummies.  My daughter enjoyed that pretty much. Would need to visit this again some time later.  The building itself is stunning and worth a visit just for that.  And the best part is that it is free, which is a big thing in London.",Very impressive and informative.
"July 18, 2019","Much of this we probably wouldn't know, without the british empires conquests! If you want to see it all, use more than 1 day.","Lots to see, clean and free entrance"
"July 17, 2019","So much to see, can spend a few hours there, only a few places is crowded, mostly ok. The place is clean, some halls are a bit warm.",Very Interesting!
"July 17, 2019","Loved walking around this museum! It was wonderful to see the statues, displays and the Rosetta Stone",so much to see...
"July 17, 2019","This is a fabulous museum for those wanting to see things gathered from across the world, in fact its probably too much to see in one day.We spent about 4 hours and only saw a few floors.  There were lots of people making it hard to read some exhibit descriptions but generally it was a good place for families.They say it's free to get in but at the entrance you are specifically directed to a person who asks if you would make a donation and then are also charged about 2.5 pounds for a coloured map where further inside maps are given out for free. However if you have a few kids it's still an excellent way to spend time in London.",Too crowded
"July 16, 2019","The exhibits in the museum are very interesting. Museum is large and it's not even possible to see everything in one visit so it's better to decide what would you like to visit. However, it's very crowded and very hot during the summer inside. I understand it's free so many people are visiting, but it's not possible to enjoy the museum under these circumstances. I think introducing a limit on number of people that can be inside at the same time could help.",Well setup and a lot to see
"July 16, 2019",Allow a good part of the day to see the mesum. If a history buff you could spend a whole week. History from many countries and guide book for 2 ponds is helpful. ,Always A Must Visit
"July 15, 2019",No amount of time will even scratch the surface for viewing their incredible collection;even see the Rosetta Stone. No where like it.,Very impressive 
"July 15, 2019",You’d definitely need more than a day to see everything here.worth the visit.good place to take children too.theres just so much to see.its free but some exhibitions you have to pay a fee for entry.,Rosetta stone and more!!!!
"July 14, 2019","What an amazing collection!!!! Open to all for free. We saw the Rosetta stone which was much larger than we expected,  Egyptian and Greek collections. Didn't have as much time as we would have liked. One of the finest collections in the world. Certainly warrants a second visit.  Our 14 year old son loved the visit.",Amazing Collection
"July 14, 2019","Lots of wonders in this museum. However, in the middle of summer it’s packed and the air conditioning can’t keep up.  I’d love to come back in the winter and spend a few hours. ",Free Visit - wonder exhibits
"July 14, 2019",We went early to avoid crowds and had a lovely time.  Amazing exhibits and overall a wonderful experience.  They had folks walking around in period costumes you could take pictures with as well.  Was a bit hot in some of the rooms but I'd definitely recommend it.,One day is not enough
"July 13, 2019","Where to begin?The British Museum has an unbelievable collection of artifacts from around the world across history. Beyond the big draws of the Roseta Stone and mummies exhibits are displays organized by region and time period. While many exhibits focus on places and time periods, others explore topics such as money beginning with the earliest forms of currency through modern paper money.Admission is free but I highly recommend spending a few pounds for the audio guides. The information really helps to provide a deeper understanding of what you are looking at and provides excellent historical context.",Incredible collection
"July 13, 2019",There are a lot of things to see here!Incredibly this place is free to the public!The exhibits are amazing. The Egyptian collection has a huge amount of artefacts spanning centuries of history.You could easily spend a couple of days in here taking everything in. ,Things you will see nowhere else 
"July 13, 2019","We only had a limited time to visit so we narrowed our tour to Egypt/Assyria/Greek/Roman and found North America on the way out.  The most astonishing thing was an ancient building within the museum - amazing.  Also, the Rosetta Stone is on display.Please note:  it is VERY hot and humid in the museum in July and the crowds are immense!  Lots of folks not in their best behavior!  Wish they could find a way to cool down the exhibit rooms.",Incredible collections
"July 13, 2019",This museum is incredibly large.  Plan your visit ahead of time to know  what rooms to visit.  Wanted to take the introductory free tour but found out it is only offered 2 times per day.,Culture 
"July 13, 2019",As located nearby had a few hours walking around this amazing British institution Arrived around 3 ish still huge crowds both leaving and going in very popular as a group visit Maze of barriers prior to security but guessing for safety and protection Well laid out with decent maps to guide you not every thing is free as some of the exhibits carry a pay entry fee the rest is free with the custom £5 donation Every thing for all ages great to see so many young children being stimulated along with us oldies well worth a visit.,Almost perfect
"July 12, 2019","I thoroughly enjoyed all the exhibits I saw. Unfortunately, they closed some of their exhibits early and I didn’t have the chance to see them.",Fantastic but need some air ventilation in Summer 
"July 12, 2019",Always visit here when I have the chance. Our kids loved it and stayed engaged much longer than I thought they would for a place so big and busy. Love that it’s still free ... I would be prepared to pa an entry fee though if they would consider some air cooling or ventilation higher up in the popular displays. Highly recommend for families with kids of school age. (And others not to be left out) ,It was amazing
"July 12, 2019","No wait and my son loved it, its worth visiting it , and it was and an easy access to get there thanks to Oyster card.",Great free museum
"July 12, 2019","We went here at 10am on a Sunday and joined the small line of people. The museum is huge and so you don’t feel crowded, even with the large amount of people in it. Lots to see and read about. The mummies are especially cool. Would definitely recommend spending a few hours here. The building itself is stunning too. After leaving the main entrance, we were so happy we went through the back entrance as the line at the front was huge. ",Audio guide is a must
"July 12, 2019","This museum houses lots of amazing things, including the Rosetta Stone, some of the Greek Parthenon and an Easter Island statue. However, without the audio guide seeing these attractions kind of fell flat. When we arrived around noon, the audio guides were sold out, so get there early! It is truly amazing that entry is free, so take advantage if you’re at all considering going.",Fantastic museum
"July 11, 2019","The museum is a must see. There are thousands (literally) of things to see from all over the world in one building. I arrived mid day and it was already quite crowded. It might be better to arrive right when it opens. Bring water to drink and a snack depending on how long you plan on staying. There were a variety of of places to get food and drink but seemed fairly expensive. I don't recall seeing any water fountains. There were many staff members that could provide assistance, others who were at stations where you could handle certain items, and periodic short tours within certain exhibit areas. One thing to note is some of the rooms got very warm and stuffy.",Lots of vairety
"July 11, 2019",I really like how many different things you can see in this collection of different periods. I have been there several times and I differently would recommend others to visit but my only complain would be that toilets are always smelly and not that clean.,OK if you are into ancient artifacts

"July 11, 2019",Top quality beetroot and monkfish risotto.Love the big glass ceiling. Blew my mind to find out that each piece of glass is individual. No two are the same!,Fast fee and easy to see.  Daughter loved Rosetta Stone
"July 11, 2019",We arrived at 10:15 on a weekday at the Montague entrance. Waited about 15 minutes behind a couple of groups - moved fast. Great to arrive at that hour - grade straight tonRosetta Stone.  Museum Map is great in pointing out “must sees” if you have 1 hr or 2 hrs. ,Interesting
"July 10, 2019","Loved it. Not completely organized as one would expect (sometimes just a little confusing). Tons of people checking out the Egypt colletion, other parts not so crowded. Beutiful museum, I just wish people took a little more time watching the exibition, reading about it and not be taking soooo many pictures all the tim",Amazing and Free
"July 10, 2019","We were told not to my the British Museum during our first trip to London and it was great advice.  The place is huge and I could easily spend several days in here.  The Lobby is breathtaking.  We had three kids of different ages and each one of them got to do an activity which the other kids enjoyed and was very informative.  The staff members were very friendly with the children and helped them figure the activity they wanted to participate in.  I cannot believe the amount of artifacts and all for the public to enjoy for free.  There are donation boxes and we felt it was worth giving to this institute.  We did go early in the morning and were in without any waiting, however on our way out we did notice that there was a line.  This is a fun place and well worth the visit.  ",Very good
"July 10, 2019","This place is very interesting, however on our visit i think every school in the local area visited too!The exhibits are very good, definitely worth a visit!",Fantastic Museum
"July 10, 2019","From start to finish, an excellent museum to see!  Entrance is free and there are programs you can donate a couple pounds to have.  I found the programs super helpful - there are suggestions of the top highlights to see which guided me and I was able to see them all!  The map is easy to navigate and the museum is so well labelled that I had no difficulty making my way through the museum.  From the Egyptian collection to the Rosetta stone and the Japanese Gallery, there is something for everyone.  A must see when going to London!",One of the Worlds best museums
"July 9, 2019","One of the Worlds best museums, a must see location, fantastic content through multi-periods, very busy in high season.",Interesting
"July 8, 2019","Interesting exhibits at this big, busy museum. We got there for opening time and the crowds were already there so I think it’s busy all day every day.",Must go
"July 7, 2019",This is an incredible museum with so much to see.  We love reading about each thing.  You can spend a long day here.  It is worth taking the time.,One of the world's most important art collections
"July 7, 2019","Aside from the famous Elgin Marbles, Rosetta stone and the Greek vases, this museum has a world-class collection of art from countless other cultures and traditions. The crowds can be overwhelming at times so consider coming during off peak times. It can also be overwhelming since it is so big so it is best not to expect to see everything in your first visit.",Top 3 Museum in World
"July 7, 2019","Loved my FREE visit to the British Museum. If ancient civilizations and antiquities interest you then you will be in heaven here. Greece, Egypt, Middle East, Roman, China, India, etc was well represented. Rosetta Stone, Mummies, Statues of all kinds. I loved this museum that represents the worlds great treasures. Thank you British Museum for saving and showing them to me. WOW",Classical Greek Sculptures
"July 7, 2019",This museum is worth a visit just for the Elgin marbles. There is a lot to see here so grab a map and plan your visit. We spent most of our time visiting the Ancient Greece and Rome and European galleries. Check out both the free and special exhibitions.,The British Museum never disappoints!
"July 7, 2019","We weren't sure if we would visit the museum this time around, but our 13yo granddaughter spied an advertisement in the tube station for a Manga exhibition and thought that sounded awesome -- so off we went. We couldn't believe we ended up spending over four hours at the museum; she was interested in so many displays, from their stunning Egyptian artifacts and mummies to the ceramics from all over Asia. It's a gorgeous museum with something for everyone -- impressive galleries and collections, bright, airy open spaces, gorgeous bookstore, and delicious cream tea with scones when your legs need a rest!",Very quick visit on a busy summer day
"July 7, 2019","Went here on July 1 which was a sweltering hot Saturday. It was very crowded, but the queue to get through bag check was faster than I thought it would be. At least it was in the shade. The museum was packed with people and we sort-of rushed through a lot of it, just hitting the highlights. I suppose the upper floors don't have air conditioning, so it was not the relief from the heat we had hoped it would be. We got to see the main attractions including the mummies (cat mummy is a favorite) and the Rosetta stone and Parthenon marble carvings (AKA Elgin marbles). The gift shops were great, but long queues here, too. Didn't eat there, but wanted to. You needed a reservation for the good restaurant in the middle. All in all, it's an amazing place with the (stolen) treasures of the world, just not a perfect outing on a busy, hot summer day.",Spectacular Museum
"July 6, 2019","Easily one of the greatest museums in the world.  The British Museum holds some incredible art and artifacts.  Even for those who aren't museum fans (eg. my 10 & 13 year old kids) this museum will delight.  Plus, like all museums in London, its completely free!! So you don't have to worry about staying to get your money's worth and seeing every item and exhibit.  We made sure to see the Rosetta Stone, the mummies and the Elgin Marbles along with some of the other art and my kids really enjoyed themselves.  Definitely a must visit for anyone coming to London and a place you can go again and again and never get bored with.",Another great site.
"July 6, 2019",Lots and lots to see. We were lucky to have a private tour guide and she asked what our interests were before we started.We were there over 3 hours and could have gone back again and again.,Fascinating collection
"July 5, 2019",Our family spent 2-3 hours just looking at the ancient civilizations rooms--we could have easily spent the entire day here.  Arrive early (at opening time) to avoid a wait to get in.,An attraction on our London attraction itinerary
"September 12, 2021",Booked on line. No long queues and got on the attraction very quickly. The pods were being cleaned and sanitised before anyone was allowed on. The pod was clean and the views for brilliant. The ride lasted around 45 mins and was worth the price. In a brilliant location and easy to get to,Great Views 
"March 7, 2020","You get some great views of London from both sides of the pod you're in. Considering the amount of people that use the Eye it is quite expensive, the best thing to do is log on to 'Days out London' and get buy one get one free, which makes the trip £30 for 2 people, a lot better than £60 for 2. You also get to see the 4D show, it lasts for about 5 minutes and is well worth it. Would recommend but only 2 4 1.",2 attraction ticket
"March 11, 2020","Wheelchairs are catered for and staff in ticket office were very helpful. Making our way through the roped queue system we found ourselves faced with uphill ramp to get to the pods. 2 members of staff saw us as we started up the ramp. There were some stands and rope providing 2 access routes. However neither were wide enough for the wheelchair. As my husband pushed me and the chair up the ramp I had to lean and try to move each bollard so we could get passed. The 2 staff just watched, smiling at us. Neither had any sense of moving to assist us get to the top. Once at the top my husband and bag were checked. I wasn't!! So if anyone had been watching it's clear how to get a device onto a pod. Everyone needs to be checked. Enjoyed the ride but personally was a bit underwhelmed. ","Good, but is it priced too high? "
"August 19, 2020","Myself and my partner visited London on a mini break and decided we would go on the London Eye. It was my second time being on it so I don’t know if that made it less exciting for me or not but to me it does seem over priced for what you actually receive. You are also put into a pod with other people but I think there is an option to have an exclusive pod at a higher price.For us the cost definitely overshadowed the experience and would really only recommend if there is an option to do it at night, I think this would help with the wow factor and help justify the price, on a standard day it was lacking something for us. Staff were very helpful and pleasant, and good covid 19 protocols in place.","Excellent view, but expensive"
"January 3, 2020","Great view and experience in the cabin- there is plenty of time to look around and take pictures.The 4D cinema 4 minute movie is also great and worth doing (quick to do).However... victim of its own success, look at the picture of the standard queue (even if part is the passing foot traffic). I couldn’t face it and we took fast track, where there was also a wait, but its okay (less than 10 min roughly when we were there). And most of all, fast track or not, its very expensive! Around 80 pounds for two for a total of 25 minutes capsule time (fast track).On balance, it’s one of those things to do as part of the London tourist trail that you can’t get elsewhere. It’s down to what you are ready to pay..",Eye got a bargain...
"November 17, 2020",On my visit to Madame Tussauds I was given the opportunity to buy a reduced price ticket for the London Eye. The ticket was only £4 so was an absolute bargain. I visited during October half term. I was early for my pre-booked slot but was able to make my visit earlier. The queue wait was only about 10 minutes. Due to social distancing there were only very small groups in the capsules which meant there were lots of opportunities to take great photographs. I visited due to the bargain ticket but I do feel that there are better places to get views of London now. I particularly like the Sky Garden which is completely free. ,Great view - expensive and a long queue
"October 4, 2020","One of the main attraction in London, and you should definitely view it. However, I recommend booking a slot online in advance, so you are able to skip the queue. It offers a variety of premium options, that may also be of interest. Overall it is a pleasant experience, with an amazing view. Although it states that the ride is 45 minutes is it 20-25 mins in total.",a must do
"July 1, 2020","would highly recommend doing this. isn't too expensive, your on it for a decent amount of time so not too short but not so long it gets boring. can get fab pics, would deffo recommend going just before the sun sets so you get daytime and nighttime pictures. ",All experience
"August 25, 2021",Very good experience all in all. The pre booked ticket allows you to join the line and there were no issues with that. Staff very friendly and helpful. The queue was very long but was constantly moving so it didn’t feel like we were there very long before we were getting into the pod. The pod was rather busy and getting to the best spots to see stuff was a bit challenging at times. The adults in the party had a great time and the kids started out with enjoying it but after 25mins of looking at everything they soon burnt out. I’d advise just bringing a little toy for young kids just in case. All in all a good experience,The most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom
"July 2, 2020","The London Eye on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. It is an observation wheel that offers amazing views of the city from above.  It is also the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom and over 3 million people visit it every year. But this time it was completely empty and the area deserted due to the coronavirus lockdown. I have to say that it is definitely worth visiting. During this unusual time, you have time to stop and enjoy the beauty of what surrounds you. Especially if you are lucky to be there when the sun is shining.",Nice view but nothing special
"June 3, 2020","I visited the London Eye with my boyfriend, as it was his first time in London and we had purchased the London Explorer Pass, which we could use for plenty of sights in London. We got very excited, as I had never entered the London Eye either. However, we had to wait in a really long queue (it can be endless, especially at the weekend or on special days) which was quite annoying. The view is impressive, indeed, but I think the whole thing is a bit overrated (and overpriced). If you are willing to pay for it, maybe you should pay a little more, so that you get a skip-the-line ticket.",Vibrant atmosphere and thrilling rides
"November 29, 2023","The views are breathtaking and the experience is unforgettable. The wheel itself is an impressive feat of engineering, with its 32 capsules and a diameter of 120 metres. It's a great way to take in the sights of London in a unique way. The light show is especially spectacular at night, making it a great way to end a day of sightseeing in the city.","A trip highlight, all thanks to great customer service. "
"September 13, 2021","We purchased tickets for the pub pod experience but stupidly, I had gotten my dates confused and had booked the previous weekend. I somehow did not realise this until we attempted to enter the VIP area and the attendant, Drew, kindly informed me of my mistake.It was at this point that I was resigned to losing our tickets and felt that was a fair punishment for making such a mistake.Of his volition, Drew said not to worry and he went to double check with his manager if there were any free spaces available on our selected experience which thankfully there was.I would like to highlight how impressed we were with Drew's customer service as he had no need to do what he did for us.The pub pod experience itself was really fun and it was made more enjoyable by our host Arnie who managed to make 16 drinks in 30 minutes and still found time to make jokes and take pictures. ",WOW
"December 20, 2020","I went into London with my friends and decided to see the London eye and I don’t regret it. The views we’re STUNNING and it slowed me to get a new perspective in London as a city. At night, the London Eye is lit up into different colours and it was breathtakingly beautiful. It made me proud to be a Londoner.I would recommend this to anyone( even people who are scared of heights).",Pub pod - great!
"June 27, 2021","We did the Pub Pod pop up with Beefeater Gin. Great experience with 2 drinks across the rotation. Our host AJ was very welcoming, friendly and great fun to have on the trip! The decoration of the pod as a pub with seats, plants and a dart board was very fun",Sightseeing 
"January 1, 2020","Bought the fast track  from the adjacent  booth - quicker than the main office (plenty of queues) wish we’d booked a package. Well directed and on the eye in 5 mins beating the queues, so well worth it on a Cold Sunday. Would be good if there were maps on board to pick out landmarks.  Good security checks. Don’t like having to have my photo taken twice however.  ",Not worth the money
"February 23, 2020","You definitely don't need a fast pass as the queue times aren't massive. We were there at half term and waited around 10 minutes to get on. They search you before you get on, which is definitely the right thing to do. However, there needs to be a nicer, more humane way of doing it. A certain security guard was horrible, his attitude was disgusting and the way he was treating people just wasn't on. It completely ruined the whole experience for me and my family. The actual ride itself is good. The views over london are fantastic, and my kids loved it. But it is a total rip off, and I definitely would not do it again.",Easy iconic London experience
"April 4, 2023",We had a great experience with the London eye. Booking online was easy and its allowed to change your time booking if your plans change. We were very lucky that the day we went we had clear blue skys so very good views. We booked Tuesday at 11.15am and despite it being half term only had to que for 13mins before getting on. Process is very efficient. We were on the eye for 25mins.,Inconsistent pooling of people in pods.
"February 18, 2020","I got rammed into a pod with some 25 other folks. The next few pods had 7-12 people in each so photos were hard to take.The queues weren't too bad. They have a fast pass if you want to pay more to wait a shorter period of time.I combined my ticket with a river tour and enjoyed that immensely.It felt like a cash grab to do green screen touristy photos, but to each their own for memories.I would do this again in nicer weather but only if someone came with me. It feels uneventful as a solo traveler.I also live in a city where there are lots of skyscrapers. So I would have access to many different city vantage points.",Happy 20th Year London Eye
"March 17, 2020","Pleased we did this attraction well worth the views although at times our pod was quiet, enjoyed it very much. Queues were well organised and kept moving well, pods cleaned between each set of people. Cannot believe it's 20 years old.",Awesome experience 
"February 22, 2020","Never thought I'd get onto this as I hate heights bit my ten year old convinced me to so we did. Absolutely incredible views, went on at half 5 so was perfect so seeing the sunset and the views of the London lights.. Was very spacious and there was no wobbling or anything so it didn't make me nervous about the height. It's worth it. ",Ridiculously Overpriced
"July 7, 2021","Passing the Eye whilst strolling along South Bank we decided to give the Eye a go. The ticket office during the day was closed and the only way to obtain a ticket was using the booking system on-line. Adult prices were a whopping £31 each. The queue was not that long in numbers but it was slow in boarding. The ""kids"" that decided who got on board didn't seem to follow a fixed Covid friendly numbers game so some cabins had 3, some 6 but mine 12 or possibly more. Sometimes a cabin passed with no-one admitted. As for the experience - worth it if you haven't already been up the free Sky Gardens but it really hurts the wallet to pay these supercharged ticket prices. Even if they charged £10 a ticket that might be high for what you get.",Skip
"May 25, 2023","Visited with a fast pass that included any time of day entrance.  While that definitely saved us time, the actual experience was not enjoyable. You are crammed in with other people and when one of them is screaming to get off as employees watch the doors close, you wonder what they are possibly thinking.  So because they ignored the screaming woman we all had to experience the London Eye while she had a full blown panic attack the entire time.",Amazing service considering we were so late!!
"August 2, 2021","We had booked for the London Eye for 1.45pm, after struggling to find parking in London, we didn’t get to the Eye till around 5.15pm. We thought we’d try our luck, expecting to be turned away as we were so late. Spoke to a lady and she said that we were able to still get on! My little girls were so happy and so were we, especially as it’s so expensive. The lady reassured us, and then within 5 minutes came back with some London Eye Binoculars for the little ones. Such lovely customer service, she literally went above and beyond!",Better than expected! 
"February 11, 2020","The missus has been on about visiting the London Eye for years, so we had the opportunity and went. As we arrived, so did about 100 French kids and I nearly binned it, however, a staff member took us both aside and moved us into the fast track queue so we didn’t have to be with screaming 10 year olds which I though was a very nice thing to do. Really appreciated that gesture, so kudos to the staff. Views were better than I expected too! All in all, a decent trip and recommended. ",Amazing time on the London Eye and River Cruise
"August 16, 2022","We had a lovely time on the joint London Eye/River Cruise experiences. Both were always going to be great, but what lifted it even further was the wonderfully informative and humorous commentary by Elliot on our cruise (Saturday 13th August). We thoroughly enjoyed our day.",If you want views a trip to Tate Modern is better
"March 1, 2020",It really isn’t worth it for the money. Better off going to Tate Modern level 10 Viewing Platform for a great view of London skyline and it’s free entry. You could couple this with a river boat ride,Fantastic views
"January 7, 2020","Visited as a family of 2 adults, 9yr and 13 yr old. We got there just after 10 on a Saturday and luckily there was barely a queue. We walked past a few hours later and we couldn’t believe the queues.I think you can have up to 25 in one capsule but we had about 12 and felt that that was just about enough. The views are spectacular! What I liked was that you can sit or walk around the capsule which makes the 30 mins literally flyby.Yes it’s a bit pricy but I would definitely recommend it. I’m hoping I can persuade the family to visit again at night.The only negative was that no one informed us of the 4d experience, I only stumbled across this when looking for a toilet. ",Loved the views
"March 22, 2023","We had a great time on our London Eye Champagne Experience. Arnie, the VIP concierge was super helpful in explaining what we were to expect in the capsule, helping us bypass the long line, and explaining what we were seeing throughout the beautiful city and it’s views. Those views! Cannot imagine a better place to get pictures and a 360 degree vista of London. We were in the capsule with approx 12 people and enjoyed the champagne and conversation. Arnie even gave me hints on how to take portrait photos on my iPhone and on how to edit them. I believe that all those aboard enjoyed themselves and the champagne experience. My only complaint is that we only had enough champagne for one glass per person which seems to be a company policy. Other than that, it was a wonderful experience and we highly recommend this tour.",Total rip off! Not worth it at all!
"April 30, 2023",Really not worth the money. A maximum of £15 might have been ok. Totally underwhelming and feel robbed!! We paid for the fast track to avoid queues but that wasn’t worth it…the standard ticket queue was only twice the length of ours. Would NOT recommend this attraction in London with all the things there are to do in London!,VIP London Eye
"November 14, 2023","My husband and I had a great experience! Our ticket time was at 3:45 pm. Check-in was easy at the VIP Ticket office, the staff was friendly, and the office wasn't busy. We checked in early and were asked to wait upstairs in the Eye Lounge Bar. We each had a drink (that we paid for), and then our host, Rheanon, received us and personally escorted us onto our London Eye pod, bypassing the standard admission line (with the 3 other people who also booked this experience). On the pod, we each had a delicious glass of Pommery champagne and enjoyed the city sights, it was very romantic. We chatted with Rheanon, she was so kind and bubbly. She was gracious enough to take pictures of us with the sunset and Big Ben in the background (they turned out great). The view was so beautiful! It was my first time in London, and I'm so glad we did this! I definitely recommend this experience to everyone. ",London Eye Champagne Experience
"November 13, 2023","I have been on on the Eye several times. We had a Champagne Flight, Rheanon made today’s visit the best yet, friendly, happy and full on interesting information.",Great family trip to London

"September 27, 2020","As a Londoner, I take anyone who visits on the London Eye.  I've been so many times now, but still don't tire of it.  Worth doing anything you can to pre-book and beat the queues however, because it can be a bit of a long wait....",Amazing views
"August 6, 2021","Fantastic views all around London, would highly recommend this experience.  Get there a bit earlier for your time slots and queues can get quite big during busy times.  Well organised and the handrails on each pod are cleaned before the next group get in.",Great Views of London
"August 15, 2021",We pre booked online before visiting and picked an early slot as know it gets busy later in the morning and afternoon.Glad we did have a 11:00 slot as by midday there was quite a queue.Was an amazing experience especially as it was a clear day.We had my elderly parents with us and the staff were very attentive and supportive in getting them on and off the capsules.,Must see attraction 
"September 6, 2021","The whole family loved the London eye. Spectacular views of London. Was a little expensive to pay on the door, but if you book in advance or hunt around the internet for deals you can make substantial savings. We pod £55 for a family of four.",You have to visit without doubt
"October 21, 2022","We have booked standard tickets and we were lucky because the queue was not long, hence we get in quickly. We do not believe that is worthy to spend money for fast track. The speed was acceptable , hence we spent about 30 minutes on the air . The view was incredible even the short showers. My children were really enjoying picturing London from top. The height is long for some of us a bit scary but it’s worthy to do it",Quick London trip
"June 19, 2021",Booked for 11 so to be in the first turn of the wheel - didn't seem to over pack the pods (10 ) so you had enough space to move around . Fabulous views and was helped with it being a clear day so you could see everything. Recommend,Memorable experience 
"October 22, 2022","We had taken Champagne experience on 21st October 2022 evening.Dan was our host for the evening. He was fun, kept everyone engaged and had jolly good sense of humorWe would recommend this to anyone wanting to experience London eye ",View of London
"March 16, 2020","Cool view of London! It goes around slow enough (but not too slow) that you’d be able to take photo from different angles. They do put groups of people in the tube at once, so you’ll be with other people. It’s cool to have such an encompassing view of London ",Fantastic experience!!!
"September 4, 2021","Wedding anniversary gift on trip to London and was the perfect gift to remember everything we’ve been missing about this beautiful city.Great service from start to finish, not as busy as we expected but great weather only added to the beautiful views. Would definitely recommend A special thank you to Stephanie who made our experience that extra bit special ",AMAZING!
"February 2, 2020",Second time on the London eye but this time at night and it didn’t disappoint. The view is incredible and even though the que was long it went down very fast. The booth was fairly full but still managed to see everything and enjoy the experience. You get your bags checked which I think is essential when visiting a tourist attraction especially in London. I was with 2 young children and they thoroughly enjoyed it too. Great experience and one I Highly recommend. To me it is a key thing to experience if you are visiting London. Definitely a highlight of my trip!,Great evening 
"November 11, 2023",Amazing experience. Gisela at the entrance - thank you for being so kind and friendly! My friend and I hadn’t planned to do this tonight but I’m glad we went up the London eye tonight :),Amazing
"November 11, 2023",It was amazing one of the best experiences of my life. I had so much fun with my family. The view was astonishing. I was so in shock I thought that I would be to scared because of how high it was but It was great. Really recommend it if you are looking for a family outing. Was also not to expensive. We went as a package deal to Madame Tussaud’s aswell that day it was a package deal.,Great
"October 19, 2023",I know people disagree on whether the London Eye is worth it or not. We visited with teenagers and they would very much have the experience - and they were thrilled and thereby I’m happy. Wouldn’t go there next time visiting London as it’s kind of a ‘do it once’-thing. But it was a great visit. Visited at 8PM and there were no people. Great,Pub pod
"June 10, 2022","We did the pub pod today and it was amazing. The staff made us feel like real VIP’s and we were lucky enough to have the pod to ourselves. We’ve done the eye before but doing this was something else. I’d highly recommend it and can’t thank the hosts enough for all they did, especially making my husband feel at home as he’s a little scared of heights",Great experience!
"October 29, 2022",The London Eye was a fantastic experience. We were so impressed with how well organised it was. The wait time was 10 mins from start to finish and that was in peak half term time! We had our 5 year old with us and he just loved it too. Plenty of room in the capsule to move around and get great views. My only issue is the cost of the photos. We loved our photo but The packages were so pricey.,A must do!!!!
"January 30, 2020","We absolutely enjoyed the London Eye. Family of 4, 2 adults & 1 teen, 1 tween. Make sure you get there early during opening times or you'll be lined up forever! Although the line does move.There were about 15 of us in one gondola which made it easy to move around & take pics.  There's also an option to watch the Virtual Tour, we did it & found it amazing! Great memories!!",Pub pod is a must!
"March 25, 2022","After previously going on the with a standard ticket I wanted to take my guests on a slightly different experience. After the champagne experience was fully booked a member of staff suggested we tried the ""Pub Pod"". (Which we had never heard of, thought was not really advertised and hard to find) We definitely were not disappointed. In our pod was just us four and couple. Pretty much a private pod! Our Server, or in this case pub landlord, Sam made our experience one to remember. He was friendly, informative and had a good sense of humour.  We drank whiskey, payed some games, and we won some limited edition merchandise.  It was so good we wanted to do two rotations. This experience is a real must if you want an almost private pod with a few drinks and great customer service. Thank you Sam, we really felt like VIP's.",Good with friends
"August 31, 2021",If you are from London its a good way to see the whole city as on a good day you can see from Stratford to Heathrow. I definetly feel the more people you know you have in a capsule the better as its a more enjoyable experience. The only down side is the price of the tickets. ,Kids love it
"January 19, 2020","For me, as I’ve been a few times the novelty has worn off.... after all its static, the view doesn’t change.... just time of day or weather buts it’s definitely a crowd pleaser for when it’s your first time. The children always love it so that’s a big plus...",Lastminute.con
"July 10, 2021",I have never been on the London Eye but I would like to but unfortunately today in the newspaper I noticed it is sponsored by one of the worst and dishonest travel company I have ever had the displeasure to have had dealings with. Please read about them especially on trustpilot and other travel sites. At one point they were goingvto be taken to Court by the government. How they have the nerve to sponsor anyone when they owe people millions in cancelled flights. They are a dusgracecto the travel industry.  Hence the London Eye will have to wait for me until they disappear as sponsors. Sorry but rant over. Nothing personal re tge London Eye itself.,Weekend Tourists
"February 26, 2020","First stop after flight into London city. Easy to self book, quick thru security and a great ride in the view pods. A good experience and clean environment. Would visit again but take the deal on 2 or more attractions, £40 for this isn't cheap. ",Good experience but pod seemed like too many people
"August 15, 2023","The queue was extremely long, but as my sons have a nimbus card we were allowed to use the accessibility line which really helped. The staff members we met were all friendly, helpful and polite. I do think they put too many people into a pod, (but can understand why) as wasn't able to move freely round as everyone was crowded in the same area and my children couldn't always see out.  However it was a good experience and they enjoyed going so high up.",Do At Least Once
"September 18, 2022","On a clear day, this is a really fun way to see London from ""up top."" Given the cost, don't bother when it's terrifically cloudy. Also try to book online even at the last minute. We booked 15 minutes before going in and skipped the ""fast track"" charge. Do buy the guide that shows you what you're looking at, otherwise, you aren't getting the full experience.","Good experience, pretty pricey and overcrowded"
"February 25, 2023","We visited around 4.30pm. The views from the pod are amazing, it takes around 30 minutes and personally found it a little underwhelming. There were around 22/23 people in our pod, which made it difficult to get images. People kind of settled in a spot and didn't move. It was a good experience, unlikely to do it again.  ",Really lovely visit
"October 29, 2020","Our 6 year old daughter had been asking to go for sometime and she was not disappointed. We booked a 5pm boarding and arrived just after, we walked straight through the checks and boarded quite quickly. Everything was very Covid friendly! The skyline was all lit up and we had a clear day which meant you could see a lot. Toilet facilities etc inside the booking hall were very clean and more than enough available. Staff were friendly and chatty with our daughter. ",Big wheel
"January 15, 2020","Second time we’ve been out, we have Merlin premium so we can fast track which is good. We ended up in a pod with a family who liked to take photos, my god, they were so loud and Instagrammable it just ruined the whole experience. Great views over London, was very annoyed at the end when it tells you to stand in the photo zone my daughter did and this group of plastic Kardashians clapped their hands at her and told her to move, I was in a gap behind and made sure I had the most awful face 😂 hope I ruined your picture because I couldn’t be cropped out. It’s a good thing to do in London just hope your get nice people in your pod. ",Always a good experience 
"August 30, 2020",Been on here a few times over the years but has been a long time and our youngest had never been on. The queue was short as I imagine it’s hit by coronavirus. Very impressed with the speedy cleaning between use and the fact that the pods were not rammed as they can be. If you haven’t been on this is a fab attraction to see right across London. I’d definitely recommend you go on. Even if you hate heights like me! ,Ok
"March 13, 2023","Treated my 6 year old to a weekend in London for her birthday. She couldn't wait to get on the London eye. Ended up being a tad disappointed because the capsule we were in was full of adults who hogged the one end (the main view over London) I get that everyone wants to see the view but there's plenty of time for the wheel to spin around for everyone to get a good view and move around. Unfortunately we were unlucky that day and those who were on with us wouldn't let the children onboard get to the main part... Even despite asking politely. So we ended up spending most of our time watching some 20 year old and her boyfriend create their romantic tiktoc or Instagram content.Anyway Would i still recommend it if visiting London... yes absolutely. Hope when we're back in December with the rest of the family, that we can get a better look.",Make sure you book 
"January 7, 2020","Expensive, long queues but one of the must-do things when visiting London. Great views in the sunshine or at sunset but pretty grim if it's a miserable rainy day. Go to Alexandra Palace instead.. Great views across London, free and you can go ice skating there too. ",Another great ferris wheel journey
"September 18, 2021","Came here with a friend on 241 tickets on merlinfun.comThe staff were welcoming and helpful, the weather was good with a bit of cloud  its situated right next to the London Thames and it takes around half an hour.The views and photo opportunities are amazing and its well worth a visit with other activities nearby like shrek adventure , sea life centre, London dungeon and can have a good walk alongside the river ThamesJust a shame big Ben is covered in scaffolding at the moment.Well worth a visit at this time and I have been to a ferris wheel in Paris and Vegas ",A must see!
"December 17, 2023","A must do/see! London eye was such a cool experience! Book in advance and choose the flex pass for a few more pounds. We rode the London Eye at night and the view was amazing! I’m sure you can see more during the daytime , but the lit up London view was pretty magical! Heads up - you’re probably going to want to buy everything at the London Eye gift shop. But if you walk just across the way to the other gift shop (literally, right across) you will save some money and have more souvenir options.",Nice Experience 
"January 30, 2020","I wasn't sure how I felt about going on the Eye of London, but I don't regret doing it. It literally does what it says, gives you an eye of London. We had the opportunity to visit it on a nice sunny day. It is perfect for pictures, and aerial sight seeing. I bought fast track tickets, which I recommend as it helps you to skip the line. They fit about 10 to 25 people in a pod; mine only had 10. I honestly think more than 10, would be too much, especially since they put you with random strangers. The staff was friendly and helpful. They do check your bags before you get on, so be aware of that. No alcohol is allowed on either. Would I recommend? YesWould I go back? If I was with a different group whose never been on ot before.",Brilliant VIP experience!
"May 2, 2023","I booked the VIP champagne experience for myself and my husband and once the coronation was announced we were upgraded to the coronation capsule! We got to sit on the throne and wear the crown in the capsule while taking in breathtaking panoramic views of London. The standout was our host Arnie - he was amazing! A great sense of humour, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and a brilliant photographer. He made sure everyone was included and had brilliant memories to take away with them. I absolutely recommend this experience to anyone visiting London.",Wonderful Attraction!
"March 3, 2020","Everything went smoothly. We arrived about 45 minutes earlier and were told to join the queue 30 minutes prior to our ticket time. We did so and were directed to our capsule, which had a bunch of lovely tourists whom took turns to take one another's photographs. We loved every minute. Just a bit disappointed that the Big Ben was scaffolded. The 4D cinema afterwards was an added bonus, the kids had a blast with the special effects. I highly recommend.",Amazing Service
"September 26, 2020",Had booked as a package deal but couldn’t book online for an extra experience at the time so we’re advised to go to customer service on the day to upgrade.Annoyingly that was not the case on arrival as fully booked ( gutted ) but the manager did arrange for a private pod at no extra cost!!! So kind and much appreciated and all the staff from start to finish were so so friendly especially  as we had a nervous passenger lol.The views were amazing and even though really high winds the pod felt safe. Only issue was the half and hour seemed like 5 minutes!!!!!!Can’t wait to return for a trip at a different time of day.Highly recommend and many thanks to all the staff - great experience- we loved it!!!!,😤
"February 11, 2020","Great attraction for a family with kids.We had to give us the tickets we pre-booked for the Big Bass tour attraction and didn't give, that's why we lost an attraction.You are being photographed without your knowledge and at the exit trying to sell you expensive products.",One of the best views
"March 13, 2023","The whole experience takes about 30 minutes. I viewed the city from the Shard, Skyview Garden, and the London Eye.  The due to the location, the London eye provided the best views of London's attractions.",London Eye VIP
"December 17, 2023",We booked a VIP experience and it was really fabulous.We were booked straight in and shown to the Eye Lounge for half an hour before the ride. Charlie our guide was really friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We were able to purchase a drink prior to the ride in the lounge and were served by a lovely young man behind the bar.All staff had impeccable manners.We were taken to the front of the queue to board and had a wonderful half an hour on the Eye. The champagne was poured and Charlie gave us lots of facts about the skyline of London.We shared the cabin with ten others but h th eye wa comment of room and everyone gave each other the option to look through the windows of the different views. Charlie also took photos as requested.Would definitely rate this experience and do it again.,Good lockdown visit
"November 21, 2021",Went over lockdown - had a really good time with a pod to our self. If there was 20 people in one I think it wouldn't be a great experience. Takes you to a good height and is great to see around the area from that perspective.,Couldn’t see much
"December 10, 2023",My wife and I went whilst on our honeymoon. It was raining outside which wasn’t the best (I know that’s no one’s fault)  but what ruined it was the condensation on the inside. By the time we got to the top we couldn’t see. In my eyes it was a waste of £90.As you can see by the photo. No one was that interested because they couldn’t see out.,Ivan Van Der Westhuzien - employee of the year
"April 8, 2023",Birthday treat to the London Eye today. Had a standard ticket and whilst waiting in the queue the fabulous Ivan Van Der Westhuzien greeted us took us to the fast track queue! He was vibrant and we really enjoyed chatting with him.,First post Covid Trip
"August 10, 2020","We've been on the Eye 4 times and every time it has been great, This was our first visit after social distancing. The staff were superb in everything they did and our party of 6 were provided with a pod on our own. Each pod is thoroughly cleaned between rotations. Great experience. Thanks",Aerial views of Beautiful London 
"October 1, 2023",Amazing!  Weather was perfect.  Great views of London. Fast service not too crowded.  Highly recommend.  ,London Eye is great!
"October 1, 2023",This is a must do when in London. View across the London skyline is beautiful. Takes about 20-30 minutes to make a complete rotation.,"While taking photo from ground make it more perfect, overall experience is amazing "
"September 30, 2023","Very beautiful, memorable moments. My family enjoyed the beauty of London. We are planning to come again with our friends ",Excellent!!

"September 29, 2023",view is nice but staff was really rude and unfriendly. it’s a fun way to see london but the way staff treated and talked to guests was so off putting.,Memorable 
"September 28, 2023",Took two grandsons they asked to goEnjoyed the whole experience  worth every penny and made lovely memories and moments to remember,London eye
"September 28, 2023","The London Eye was a wonderful location to visit, A definite highlight of London. Lines didn’t take too long and it was an enjoyable ride along with around 15 others. Went during sunset and as it got darker the better so I’d recommend going from sunset to dark.Great place to visit!",Breath taking 
"September 28, 2023","Amazing, staff were very friendly and helpful. We had a booked timeslot and arrived a lot earlier which didn't matter we didn't have to wait until our booked time which was a relief. The qué moved quickly and when it was our turn to step into the capsule the staff helped my mum who struggles to walk without having to ask them. The views from the eye are amazing and are a must stop if you are visiting London. ",Nice View of London
"September 17, 2023","Opportunity to get a 360-degree view of the city. Wonderful views of all the iconic buildings and architecture. For those afraid of heights, it feels stable and was not at all scary to me (very afraid of heights).","Average, not a must as a tourist "
"September 17, 2023",This was nice but I prefer to be on the ground taking pictures.  I have better shots of London from walking. It is nice to go if you have time but plan other things to explore London. ,We had booked before going to London arrived early so went to customer service to change time did this no trouble at all
"September 16, 2023",Really enjoyed the experience.my advice is to go on an early ride even if you've booked a late slot easy to change at customer service ,View all of London 
"September 15, 2023","What an experience, I'm not great with heights at all, but being in the London Eye cab, I felt very safe. About 10 other people get in with you, and their is a round bench in the middle plus hand rails all around. The view is spectacular, and the weather was warm and sunshine, so we could see everything below. Everyone must try it.",As good as you would expect
"September 14, 2023","Amazing time for a family to pass by, Amazing views of the city and the waiting times arent as trrible as you would think. One time thing, definetly not the attraction you reoeat, but worth while if visiting London.",Fantastic View From Top Of The Eye
"September 14, 2023","Booked the London Eye following the River Cruise wasn’t disappointed the queue was only 10 minutes long and the team/staff had everything under control and kept people moving, only 10 people in our pod, the sky was blue we had a clear view over London it was lovely thoroughly enjoyed, last time on The Eye was three years ago and will definitely be going again. Would book prior to save queuing also  good discounts if you book prior.  5*",London River Cruise A Must
"September 14, 2023","Had the first river Thames cruise at 10.45AM Thursday morning the sun was shining and the cruise lasted 45 minutes the compare was very knowledgeable and kept us up-dated excellent to detail. The whole cruise from start to finish was excellent it’s a must if visiting London , we booked it as a joint with the London Eye therefore much cheaper for the two. Will definitely go again could have sat there cruising all day. 5*",The Eye
"September 14, 2023","You need to include this experience in your visit plan.We got out ticket from last minute.com at a reasonable cost, booked for 1545 but got on early.Our pod only had 8 people in it.  It was cool and comfortable.The view from The Eye was amazing and London is huge.","Great view, must see"
"September 12, 2023","It's a great view and definitely recommended. Seems a bit pricy for what it is, but still worthwhile.",An excellent experience 
"September 11, 2023","We bought the upgraded tickets.  Whilst this was expensive, it was well worthwhile.The experience was excellent.  We chose a clear day and the view was excellent.  We could see all the London landmarks.",Cupid pod
"December 13, 2023","What a fantastic experience, all made by our amazing host Camilla. This was a special occasion and a surprise. It literally couldn’t have gone any better and Camilla played along brilliant. Also taking some amazing pictures and a video we will treasure forever. It’s expensive but worth every penny if it’s a special occasion",A must do  experience
"February 4, 2022","London Eye Champagne pod . Hosted by Claudia was Brilliant, both in knowledge and attention to detail. This was part of our wedding anniversary and will live long in the memory.

"January 5, 2022","Went to London Eye today for 11am slot. Arrived at 10.45, and was still queuing to get on at 11.15. Staff were standing around chatting, and queue was not moving at all. Experience itself was fab. The views were spectacular, helped by the lovely bright sunshine today. I’m usually scared of heights but didn’t feel afraid in this at all. ","Perfect attraction, for adults and children"
"November 8, 2022","You have to climb at least once in your life. Tickets are around £39 per pardon but well worth it. I went in September and did not expect a long queue. Spectacular views across London. I have vertigo and it didn't scare me, it goes very slowly. I recommend it. Spacious cabins. Too bad Big Ben was under repair.",Great views of the city
"November 22, 2022",Great views of the city. We did it at night so was great to see London lit up. Bit pricey to go on a big wheel but it’s one of those experiences that you will remember. I would visit again during the day to see more landmarks and a different perspective.,Great attraction for all ages!
"October 5, 2020","The London Eye is a fascinating place to go if you are by tourism at London City . The view from the top is amazing and you can see the Big Bang and many other interesting places from there. This is a good tour because it's attractive for all ages, adults, teenagers, kids... One thing that I think is important to say about this ride is that near the entry of the London Eye  there are some places to buy ice cream and that's really nice , but there are not other restaurants there , so you need to plan to go to another place to eat or have lunch.  However it's a fantastic place and I really wanted everybody to have an opportunity to go visit there . I went there in June 2018 with my family, and we saw the sunset, it was amazing!",Truly a disappointment.
"January 27, 2020",So expensive and so over-valued experience. Boring journey up and down seeing a lot of ugly buildings from the top (as they never were planned to be seen by their architectors). No particularly nice views in any direction.Truly disappointment.Impressive structure though.,A must do if you're in London!
"January 9, 2020",I've visited london many times but had never been on the london eye. My friend convinced me to do it and in the end I'm glad I did. The views are really good you can literally see every part of London. For someone who is not a big fan of heights it was even a really good experience for me! Even though the queues look massive they dont actually take that long to go down. Be warned though as when you get on the wheel doesn't stop each time. Definitely worth doing though! ,Well worth it
"March 13, 2020",This is something you should do when in London. There is plenty time to get a good look around the city when on here. Some great views. Only waited about 10-15 mins to get on and was definitely worth the wait. It’s high and noisy when windy but it’s worth the views. You will enjoy. ,Average experience 
"April 23, 2023","If you are doing this you should go here on your first day and as early as possible as the lines get really long. I'd say the London eye is overrated, but that is because I had already taken photos of the landmarks while on ground. It is a great place to take photos but after a while the photos start to look repetitive. If you are tired it is a good thing to do as there is a bench in the pod where you can sit for 30 minutes. I would recommend going here, however I personally don't feel the need to go back.",Arnie for the VIP experience win
"March 18, 2023","We booked the VIP experience earlier this week. Unfortunately, it was the same day as an underground strike. Because of all the traffic , we were 7 minutes late and missed our 3:30 time. When we arrived Arnie was generous enough to rebook us on the next experience at 4:30. He went with us and made everyone feel comfortable and welcomed!it was a very nice experience. We were up there for 30 minutes and saw all the major sights around while enjoying champagne. Thanks Arnie!","Excellent experience , a must do in London"
"October 2, 2023","Easy access, very nice experience, beautiful views.. we had a very good time, reached before time with pre booked tickets. Could access from the faster line and were allowed to enter before time which saved us a lot of time. The pace was good and the sights were spectacular. Number of people per pod was also optimum. ",London eye
"February 19, 2023",Went on this today and it was well worth the money. We went late in the day and was only in the que for about 10 minutes total. The views of London in the earl evening was awesome.  Plenty of room to move around the pod to take photos. Staff was very helpful and nice.  The pods were very clean and inspected after each group departed ,Expense but good view
"October 3, 2023",Expensive but good view of the city.  It moves so slowly you can’t tell you are moving.  We did it on the first day of our trip and it gave a nice view of the city.  I think slightly overpriced for a 25-30 min ride.,Part of the landscape.
"August 10, 2020","Just has to be done if you are sight seeing in London. Que is usually massive. Would always book on line and pay for fast track to make things easier, or go later in the evenings.Beautiful views of the city.",Wheely high!
"March 4, 2020","Only gave this 5 because my husband was so pleased to be here! The view was stunning to be fair 😀. The staff were very helpful to me, as I walk with two crutches. They made getting on and off easy for me.  They also clean all surfaces between parties and check under the seats for ?bombs. ",18th birthday present
"November 8, 2022","18th birthday experience for my son who has autism, I got the Access card before travelling to London which was very useful and meant we could skip the queues.  Bought the river cruise and eye tickets together and with a carer ticket it brought the price down a bit.We all enjoyed the experience and my son can now stop nagging me to take him! We also did the cable car at Greenwhich, cheap and also a fun experience :)",Ok
"January 11, 2020","Don’t expect earth-shattering views, but was good for our 1st visit to London. And online ticketing was so easy too. The car gets quite full so expect to have to “fight” your way to a good viewing spot. For my son it was a great time to spend with his UK mates, so worth the spend.",OK if you can get 2 for 1 deal
"March 4, 2020",Slightly underwhelmed by this. Seemed to be a wee bit shorter of an experience than I thought it would be. Views are good - just make sure it ain't too crowed.  Wouldn't go if you have to pay full fare.,No need to panic - it’s smooth as silk
"January 30, 2020","No need to panic - it’s smooth as silk.  Fabulous views over the north and south of the river, panoramic photo opportunities and memories you will never forget.  Excellent time of the year to go as there are no queues.",STILL AMAZING
"July 19, 2021",We've done the London Eye a number of times and it never gets boring.  London is an amazing city and looks even better from the height of the Eye itself.  Book in advance and avoid the queues.,View to London upperair

"July 26, 2022",We finished our London stay by booking the pub pod on the London Eye.  It was so much fun.  Not overcrowded.  A couple of fun drinks and of course a great view.  Sam was our bartender/guide and he just made sure all of us had fun.  He took pictures and made sure we had our drinks.   All the staff we met were friendly and helpful.  Although it isn't cheap it was well worth it.  Thanks so much Sam.,Overcame my fear - well nearly
"February 14, 2020",Waited years to go on the eye. I was brave and did it. Really enjoyed it. The views were phenomenal.Access was well organised.The 4D cinema experience was a good added extra too. ,Great view of London
"April 24, 2020",Fantastic ride at sunset. Great view. Saw House of Parliament. Depending on the day the queue is long but worth it . Nice surrounding area for a stroll. China is nearby can reach there by foot . West end is also nearby. ,Jameson’s Pub Experience
"April 3, 2022","My husband and I purchased the Pub Experience with Jameson’s. This was absolutely great! Our tour guide was called AJ, and he was fantastic. AJ really made the trip fun, informative and his cocktails were lovely! I would really recommend.",Lovely views
"August 3, 2021",This was a lovely way to see London. Lovely views and photo opportunities. Wouldn't visit again as once you've done it you've done it. Definitely worth a visit if never done before.,Great views
"February 29, 2020","Great views over the London skyline, but only if you get a good day.  Yay but staff are efficient getting you through security and onto the pods. Small kids might get bored, and remember there are no toilets on board!!!",Great tourist attraction 
"February 12, 2020",Had a fantastic time at the london eye with my 11 year old. He loved it! We did decide to pay for the que jump as we would have been waiting a long while in the cold.. but I think even if I had to wait I wouldnt have been disappointed.. great views and would reccomend to anyone visiting london!,A revisit after 20 years
"August 10, 2020","Still a fantastic attraction and even better as there are no queues courtesy of an awful disease. The views were fantastic as ever and we were blessed with fantastic cleat weather. The first, the biggest and still the best.",Go early in the morning to beat the crowds
"March 30, 2023",A wonderful way to take London in and appreciate the views of all of London's spectacular sites. The staff is friendly and we felt very safe the whole time.  The ticket booth is across the path from the eye so don't stand in line until you have your ticket.,Overall good
"August 22, 2022",Albeit a little expensive was really pleased we went on this attraction.  Was quite busy even with booking in advance but that was expected during summer holidays.  Got over my fear of heights !!!   Found green screen photo was rushed and not good quality and couldn't find our photo which was taken during the ride.  ,Finally got to see this in person - very nice!
"February 12, 2020",My wife and I spent our 10th wedding anniversary in London (first time). One of the bucket list items she wanted to do was to ride the London Eye to take in all the sights. We purchased the VIP experience package. The package included 2 free drinks before the ride as well as a fast pass to the London Eye itself - we bypassed a long line and had less than a 5 minute wait. We had our own private host (Adriana was excellent!) and there only 6 of us total in the pod. It holds up to 28 people! The ride lasted about 30 minutes and we were treated with champagne and a visual tour of the London skyline. Great time! ,Amazing attraction
"January 3, 2020","I have been with my fiancee over the london eye. The staff was professional, helpful and kind.We really enjoyed the attraction and we loved the 4d experience.On the dark side the eye's windows needed a good polish( that ruined on bit of the experience).Anyway we definitively advise it to everyone who wants to have a romantic/family experience on top of london",View of London
"April 6, 2023","If you want to see the sheer mass of London, then this ride is a must. The line went fast.. Was able to get a ticked just a few yards from the Eye. Carry your binoculars! There is alot to see, but far off!.",Worthwhile Wheel Ride
"October 15, 2023","We found the London Eye to be a very worthwhile endeavor during our stay in London. From above, the views are stunning, it gives you a better idea for the lay of the land, and it moves slow enough; which makes it not at all scary.  My only criticism is... I wish less people were in each pod that goes round.  Other than that, great views!!",1st trip! 
"September 23, 2023","Ist time on the eye, fast queuing system, around 10 people in capsule, Air con, plenty of room. Around 20 mins trip, great views of London.Recommended if you haven't done it. ",Great views of London
"March 1, 2020",We have been on the London Eye a few times and always good to do during the day and also evening when you see all the lights and London by night.It never gets boring and is great to see the London skyline change every few years.Not a cheap 15 minutes but worth it.,Great time
"February 8, 2020",Came on a day out to London for my friends birthday and was my first time on the London eye and it was a great experience we went on a Monday so.wasnt busy we got on the eye more or less straight away the staff were friendly.Going on the London eye was everything I expected and more and I'm looking forward to my next visit.,London Eye champagne room
"April 6, 2022","Went to London eye for a champagne room ride and we got the best tour guide ever, Arnie. He was so charismatic and knowledgeable, he really made the experience for us. So glad we went and I am especially glad we got Arnie, he was the best",Important Fact
"December 9, 2002","Riding the eye gives you a scenic view of London.  Parliament and Big Ben in particular.  It takes approximately 1/2 an hour to complete the rotation.  Very Important Fact!:  When they tell you to go to either side of your cubicle to take your picture...make sure you FACE OUT...there is NO camera ""in"" the cubicle.  Face the side where you will soon pass a sprial staircase. This is where the camera is.  We found this out the hardway, when after smiling at nothing for a minute...the camera went off 2 minutes later and took a picture of our backsides  :)Also..we went at night before closing. No lines!!!!  Great View!!!  Enjoy!!",No refunds!!!
"April 4, 2018","Our flight was canceled due to a snowstorm so we weren't able to fly out until the next day.  We had bought this ticket ahead of time for our first day in London but we arrived a day late due to the storm so we were unable to make it.  Since we knew we weren't going to make it, we called trip advisor and asked if we could change the date.  They said no and that all sales are final.  I'd understand if we were trying to cancel it but we only wanted to move it to two days later, they would still be getting their money. And it wasn't our fault our flight was canceled. We ended up just buying a ticket when we were there because it was still something we wanted to do.  However, do not buy this voucher if you aren't positive you will be able to make it because you will lose your money!!!",The 4D Experience was very good!
"May 1, 2012","We booked online, but had to collect our tickets. To collect our tickets there was about a 30 - 40 minute queue.  But we also got free entry into their 4D experience!  This was a fantastic little presentation showing the eye and London and just made me really appreciate where I was. We were curious as to why it was 4D? We of course expected the 3D glasses and things to pop out at you!  Well, I won't spoil the surprise of why its called 4D, but it was really awesome :)The trip up the eye itself was pretty good. About 20 minutes wait to jump into one of the pods.  There is a quick bag search before you get on. Then you just quickly get on it. I was expecting a bit more narration whilst inside the pod. But infact there really wasn't any.  There are some terminals you can use to have a look at what the sights are that you are seeing. But other than that, its pretty much up to yourself to just look out and enjoy.It was really nice to see that they don't stuff the pods too. These pods are big, and there was plenty of opportunity to walk around, take a seat without feeling like there was too many people in there. The views, as expected are pretty spectacular looking all over London. Gives you a better feeling of the geometry of the place. Looking at Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and Waterloo at the same time is not something you feel like you can do, when you explore london via the underground!",Disabled traveller discount
"September 6, 2010","It isn't advertised, but when buying tickets ask for a disabled traveller, and the carer goes free, plus you get free fast tracked too. Normal fast track price is £27 each, normal ticket £18 each.Normal price for 2 fast tracked tickets £54Total paid for fast tracked disabled over 60 and carer = £14  RESULT !!",Amazing
"August 31, 2023",Amazing view and feeling. Would highly recommend going . London is one the best cities in the world. Dont miss it!!!!!!!,Very Nice
"February 16, 2014",London Eye Trip is like being at the top of London. Its just superb. River Cruise was also great. Weather was sunny and so the overall experience was very nice.,Must do!
"June 25, 2005","On our recent trip to London, we debated over taking a trip on the London Eye. My husband thought it wasn't worth the 12.50 pounds for the half hour ride. However, the rest of our group wanted to go, so we did. It was well worth it! The views from this colossal ferris wheel are amazing. I actually thought about going again at night, so I could get the full Peter Pan ""Off to Neverland!"" effect! I would recommend going on a clear day or at night when the city is all lit up. For those who are scared:this is not a high speed thrill ride. You can hardly tell you are moving. There is no swinging action. I felt completely safe. You definitely should go! It was beautiful. Make sure you take your camera!",Expensive but it’s London. 
"December 28, 2019",We opted for the fast track tickets. From arrival to embarkation was 25 mins and this was peak time at Christmas. Great views and we caught the sunset. ,Breathtaking views--BUT reserve in advance!
"September 2, 2007","Once you are able to board your pod in the London eye, it is a wonderful 30-minute experience!  Amazing views of the Houses of Parliament, Thames River, St. Paul's, etc.  To make the most of the experience, we recommend that you try to minimize your time in line and in the ticketing/boarding area--very badly organized, crowded and chaotic!  Tips:  You can book tickets online up to 2 hours in advance of your ""flight.""  You need to be there at least a half hour before your flight time to pick up tickets.  The ""fast track"" ticket options avoid the lines, but are much more expensive.  A good mid-price choice we found was to choose the ""guided"" flight, where you have a staff member in your capsule who explains the sights.  It is a few more pounds per person, but you get to wait in a separate boarding area and are escorted right to boarding without waiting in the really long line forever.  The ticketing area is very confusing, crowded and loud, and the traffic flow inside is terribly planned.  If you have reserved tickets online with a credit card, we found that you can pick them up/have them printed out simply by inserting your credit card into one of the machines directly inside the doorway to the right.  No sign or person will tell you this, but if you have a ""guided"" flight, you can then go to the back entrance of the ticketing office, where there is a waiting lounge for guided flights.  The movement of the wheel is very slow, and did not bother someone in our party who was afraid of heights.  There is a bench in each pod and they are air-conditioned.  At the end of your flight, they offer to take your picture--for 10 pounds, you get a photo of your party in your pod, and a photo fridge magnet & key chain.  Yeah, touristy and like Disneyland, but unique.  Be sure to get close to the glass and spread out so you can see everyone, and smile--the guides do tell you in advance, but don't bunch up!!!Outside on the riverfront between the Eye and Waterloo station, there are many street performers on the weekend if the weather is nice, who are glad to pose for photos with people or kids.  There is also a small cafe selling drinks and snacks while you are waiting.  If you have regular flight tickets--be forewarned--this is one of the most popular attractions in London and the lines are LONG!  If you have kids in tow, just be prepared for the wait.",Book the Discovery Flight! Well worth the money
"August 16, 2005","I booked a discovery flight on the BA London Eye website, which at GBP 13.50 costs one pound more than the normal ticket. The only small disadvantage of this is you have to fix the date and time (six times a day, every hour from 11.30 to 16.30) beforehand. Once you have your e-ticket, you can show up just 10-15 minutes before the flight and bypass the long queue in front of the ticket office and go to the innermost counter to get your proper ticket. Then you'll be escorted to the capsule (no queue here either) by your guide who will point out famous landmarks and give you some interesting London history. At the time we went, there were 13 people having booked this flight. Even though they can accommodate upto 15 people for a discovery flight, they devided us into two capsules. As such, in our capsule, there were our family of four, a mom and her daughter, and the guide. Towards the end of the flight, there will be two cameras to capture you from outside. Our guide instructed each family to go the each end of the capsule where the cameras would be zooming and as a result we had a wonderful photo of only our family in the capsule.I highly recommend this for a worthwhile London Eye visit, especially if you plan to go during summer or public holidays.",Birthday Surprise. wonderful experience
"March 30, 2023",What a fabulous day. Dennis from Iconic  whom we met in the gift shop was a wonderful kind man. As it was a birthday present he went out of his way to make sure we were looked after and spoilt. Well done to him and the rest of the staff for making this trip so memorable. Thank you,Well worth it
"September 24, 2023","My family, including two teenage daughters, did this on our first day in London and loved it. Great views over the city. An opportunity to see lots of the familiar landmarks and a nice pace too. Wasn’t sure if I should splash out on this but it was well worth it. Recommended.","Must do, must do in London. What a view."
"August 29, 2023",We didn't have to queue for too long as pre-booked. Staff were kind and helpful. It was busy but ok. The view from the eye is pretty amazing and this is one of those must do attractions in the United Kingdom. I find the price pretty good for what it is.,Great experience with brilliant views.
"July 11, 2022",My friends and I did the pub experience for my 50th birthday.  We had a great time which was make extra special by Dan who really looked after us.Would certainly recommend it if your in London.The views were spectacular and there were information sheets which pointed out the landmarks.,Nice ride
"April 11, 2023","I purchase the flexible fast track and was great!No huge line to wait and easy access, the employees try to make people faster and in a very amicable way.The views are great, nice place to take pictures!",Touristy but a fun must do 
"July 31, 2020",It’s definitely what one would consider a tourist trap. But if you are vacationing in London I think it is a must do! The little museum for it was cute. And the views are definitely spectacular. The shard is also good for views as well. I’m a sucker for a view so both were nice ,Yes it's a tourist trap but it's worth it
"October 26, 2023",I was a little skeptical of this one since it seems like such a tourist trap - but it was really cool! Great views of the city and a very smooth ride. One of our party is generally scared of heights but she was fine on the Eye. We got some great photos despite the rain. I also appreciate the customer service - we had accidentally bought an extra ticket that wasn't used and they refunded it for us. Thank you!,Helpful staff and an iconic attraction
"January 1, 2023","Our Christmas holiday started with visit to this iconic attraction. Even though we visited London Eye previously, it is the first time in night light. Very much enjoyed our visit. Very helpful staff at the ticket counter!",Welcome back
"September 11, 2020",Excellent visit. No queues went straight on board. Due to fewer visitors we had a pod to ourselves which made the visit so special. The staff seemed genuinely pleased to be welcoming visitors back on the Eye. Sunny day so we had brilliant views.,Nice view!!
"May 18, 2022",First time in Westminster and we tried this outstanding wheel Today. Perfect for a tourist like me! Astonishing view of the city. Nothing else to say. A memorable experience. I would definitely recommend it!,Great views across London / Capsule crowded - Worth a visit once
"August 19, 2023","Second visit on the London Eye, with the first being over 10 years ago. 11am Saturday morning in August - despite it being a standard ticket, the line to get into the capsule was around 15 mins. The entry into the capsule was seamless despite being with a 5 year old. Unfortunately, too many packed into each capsule which meant it was somewhat crowded inside. Once others have taken their positions at the far end, it is difficult to manoeuvre around for the best views, particularly with a child such that they can see clearly. The photograph taken inside the capsule is usually blurry and of limited quality. The photograph prior to entry is somewhat better and amended to make it look like its taken from within. The charges for the prints are expensive and they don't create the magnets or keyrings - just give you prints and expect you to insert yourself. Great views across London if a clear blue sky. Worth a visit once - no sickness. Our ride did get stuck due to an issue but thankfully it was right at the top and so we had the best views. Quite slow and so certainly no anxiety or sense of movement.","Amazing views, potential for long lines"
"August 19, 2023","The view from the eye is second to none in London so if you are looking for a panorama this is it.  The parliament buildings are right next door and its a tremendous view as you move up to the top.  For those hesitant on the heights, the tubes you ride in rotate slowly as the wheel turns so you are always on the same plane horizontally, almost like building in a building that just happens to change scenery.  Only issue becomes when the wheel has to stop do to an issue with people getting on or off and the tube rocks back and forth slightly.   We went at 7:45pm to avoid the lines and went through fairly quickly, but during the day the lines can be lengthy",Long queue
"August 18, 2023",For a family day out I wasn’t expecting to queue for offer an hour to get on this experience of the london eye. When you have younger kids it’s hard to keep them occupied. The food a drinks available are certainly not cheap and kind of brings the mood down as it takes so long. For me the ire was ok but I think with the long wait it spoilt the experience. ,Great views of the city
"August 18, 2023",Great way to see London from a different perspective. Half hour is plenty to get all the pics and selfies anyone needs. Keeps the little ones entertained too.,LONDON EYE
"August 18, 2023","Upon arriving in London, one of the things I wanted to do was to be able to go to the London Eye. Tickets were purchased at the physical store, where the gentleman who handled the service helped us in the best possible way. The experience of being able to ride a giant wheel was very pleasant. You can see all of downtown London as well as Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace. The trip takes an average of 30 minutes and can be done in a relaxed way. The downside was the time in the queue.",Unforgettable day
"August 18, 2023","I spent a very nice day with my family at the London Eye,London Eye River Cruise and Sea life London aquarium. It was an unforgettable experience for us adults and my children.Many thanks Olga for you serving on slash cart, the whether was nice and we enjoyed all attractions you recommend as well.",Great activity for all the family 
"August 18, 2023","The boat trip was really good value for money. Very informative, Jordan, our tour guide was very good indeed. It was lovely to learn lots about London from the river. ",Good as a one off experience!
"August 18, 2023","Views were excellent from the eye, customer service was very friendly (and boy were they working hard at peak school holiday time!), queues moved efficiently and the pod was very comfortable to ride in. Only reason for a 3* review is the price which I feel is very excessive. £40 per adult for approx 30 mins on the eye, with official photos only starting from £20 each at the end of the ride. Not good value for money but an enjoyable experience to tick off whilst you’re in London.",Worth the Ticket Price
"August 17, 2023","Wow, the London Eye really measures up. We purchased the ""fast track ticket"" so we could skip the lines and were able to quickly access one of the cars on the wheel, and we had a blast! The views are simply spectacular, giving you a literal ""birds eye view"" of London that you cannot get anywhere else. I would highly recommend a visit here while in London.",Eye love London!
"August 17, 2023",Fab experience.  Lovely views of some brilliant landmarks and informative recorded guide. Photo's are way too expensive starting at £20 for 1 photo! This is a definite 'must do' in London.,"With the colorful lights in night, London Eye is incomparable"
"June 13, 2019","London Eye: 'London Eye' is a huge hammock located on the banks of the River Thames, whose height is 135 meters and the diameter is 120 meters. It was built at the time when the world was going to enter the 21st century in 2000 so that the new century can be welcomed with enthusiasm. Even after 12 years of entry into the 21st century, there is a lot of crowd of people wishing to take a walk on 'London Eye'  'London Eye' is like a big swing but in this, there are oval bins of transparent substances in which tourists sit  When the swing runs, the viewers are visible to go and see far away. With the colorful lights in the night, the shade of 'London Eye' becomes incomparable.",Vertigo sufferers do not attempt
"February 26, 2011",I decided to brave this as I really wanted to be able to say I did it with my family and didnt want to let them down . OOOOO it was awful I felt very ill although I was able to stop myself t from having a full panic attack !! The pods are a great size and if it wasnt for the seating area in the middle I probably would of attempted to jump out I was that scared ! The queue was over an hour long but I will say if it wasnt for my fear I do think it would be a very good thing to do :) The views are awesome ( so I heared people saying ) !!!,No vertigo
"May 19, 2006","I had some very serious doubts about taking a 'flight' on the London Eye. The reason for this is my fear of heights. But I am glad that I did: as you are in a totaly enclosed environment you don't get ANY vertigo.I opted for a flight with a guide, that I booked via the internet: it's not very expensive and you don't need to stand in a queue (your flight time is specified on your ticket and there is a dedicated waiting room). The explanations of the guide make it a very worthwile experience.",A world-class attraction.  Don't miss it.
"January 23, 2006","The Eye is a wonderful experience.  Each car on the wheel is an enclosed gondola, as in a ski lift, with a comfortable and stylish wooden bench in the center.  The cars are never too full, so you always have the choice of either sitting or moving about the car.  It takes half an hour to make the full circuit, and the views are breathtaking.I went in January, and there was no need to book ahead. We waited in line for about 15 minutes to buy a ticket, and no more than 5 minutes to board our car.  In fact, we were glad we didn't book ahead because the weather was terrible at the time we had originally planned for our flight.  We came back later on a sunny afternoon and had a wonderful experience.  At times of heavier tourist traffic it may be advisable to book ahead, but then in the warmer months it's less likely that the weather will be bad.  Use the weather forecast or whatever you can to plan your trip, but make sure not to miss the Eye.",Second visit
"August 5, 2018",Excellent and unforgettable experience with best view of London.  I been there family but my family loved so much so we had to pay there another visit.,Cupid Capsule not worth the money!
"December 21, 2013","Attended in December 2013 for a romantic view of london. The views are simply breathtaking, cant fault that! The service was pretty good, priority boarding and chaperone for the duration. The major let down was the capsule itself. I expected it to be decorated to create a lovely romantic atmosphere, it didn't have so much as a rose in it! The capsule was the same as all the others so it appears I paid in excess of £300 for an empty capsule!",Wow!!!
"March 20, 2006","On a clear day the views were breathtaking, it was London at it's best.We went for my brother's birthday so paid extra for the ""champagne flight"", no queues, only 6 of us in the pod and alcohol to calm my nerves!! It was just over £100 for the 4 of us which initially I thought was a bit expensive but after the trip I thought it was well worth it, an experience not to be missed.Also, if it's a warm day take time to sit by the river, listen to the buskers and watch the world (and the eye) go by, it makes you realise what a fantastic city London is.",Just Amazing!
"June 30, 2005","It is all you see in pictures and more.Just go! Please don't miss it if you're in London. The London Eye is money well spent. Enjoyed a lot, shoot a lot of photos and saw the city like I never did and ever would!GO!!",The London Eye
"October 25, 2004","I chose to see The London Eye in the evening. We caught the 9.00 train from Salisbury’s Platform 4. Went through Andover, Crewkern, Basingstoke Wimbledon, and Vauxhall & Clapham Junction. We stopped at Waterloo (named after the famous battle) where Euro-Star is, & walked along South Bank to the Millennium Bridge, there was a chilly wind off the river. Saw “Damage” the pop group filming for their latest video, they were on skateboards & a group of girls had to run screaming towards them. It was quite loud, as we were standing beneath a rail line, trains going over every 10mins. Went up Fleet St where all the media like The Mirror used to be. There is a big building with pillars made of sandstone, I’m not sure if this is where the printing offices used to be. We came to Covent Garden which I was quite amazed at; I thought Covent Garden was a park like Regents or Victoria. The London Transport Museum is in Covent Garden, we watched an entertainer juggle knives over a boy who was lying down on the floor. He also did tricks with a unicycle & fire; there were quite a number of people watching him. There is a merry-go-round at Covent Garden & lots of little shops, & a restaurant; there is also a enclosed roof so it’s good for when it rains. We stopped off at Starbucks café on the way to the Eye; you can have a free mint with your drink or a mince pie & drink for £1.25. There’s always a queue to get on the Eye, they test your baggage before you get on lest you try & blow it up. Once on the light’s dim so you can see the whole of London under nightfall, there is a wood slatted seat in the centre to sit on if you get tired. The cars move really slowly & stop to let wheelchairs on & off. Saw The Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, Post Office Tower all lit up, you can also see where the river bends round the corners. When we got off we walked through an avenue of trees lit up with blue lights, The Eye is a truly must to see; lets hope the government don’t decide to pull it down.",Captivating views
"March 19, 2022","You really can’t beat the views available once you get to the top the views all around are amazing from Horseguards Parade & Buckingham Palace to Battersea, we were so lucky as the weather was incredible with bright blue skies, the pods weren’t crammed with tourists, handrails had a quick wipe between guests, my only reservation was the cost I felt it was expensive for the 30minute jaunt at £33.50 & £25 would be more realistic, anyway I’ve done it now & so pleased I did for the memories, images & birds eye view we got, 10/10.",Great views
"July 11, 2005","We went July/05.  I booked the ticket online and just picked them up the day of the flight.  I avoided the lineups.  I also booked the early flights, there are far less people early in the morning than later in the morning or afternoon.  We only had 7 people in our capsule, which is great because you can move about freely!",Well worth the money
"July 8, 2005","The London Eye gives a really unique view of London and is well worth the time and effort.As a previous reviewer said, dont be put off by the large queue as they sell tickets at a frantic rate and this queue soon goes down even at peak times. Also as each capsule can take up to 30 people, boarding also moves at a fair pace.The best thing about the Eye is that not only can you see a large percentage of the City but you also get a real appreciation of the history as the aerial view shows the 'rings' of development over the ages.I have done the Eye during the day and it is excellent but for me the best way to see it is at sunset.  I would recommend checking the sunset time for the day and then booking a flight that starts 15 mins before.  That way you get dusk photos on the way up, sunset at the top and night shots on the way down .. you cant beat it!  We had some excellent photos but unfortunately I dont have them digitally to add to this review.",HOTEL CHOCOLAT TASTING EXPERIENCE REVIEW
"October 13, 2015","Words will not be able to express the value for money nor how truly amazing this London attraction was, but I will give it a try. Out of all the places I seen and all the tours I went on while in the capital city, this had to have been my favorite.For a mere 50₤ (that's approximately 77USD), you will receive a box of chocolates to take home with you, priority boarding, two complete revolutions on the London Eye, all the champagne you can drink (even though the online description says 2 glasses, they kept pouring us all we wanted), about 15 different types of chocolates and truffles onboard to sample, and a personal chocolatier to teach you all there is to know about chocolate.As far as the price, if you compare the costs for the different types of tickets you will see how much of a bargain this is. An online booking discount saves you anywhere from 15 to 20% on tickets depending on the tour you choose. The prices I quote are with that discount. A standard ticket costs 19₤ (about 29USD). That includes one complete revolution (1 revolution = 30 minutes) with no priority boarding. No onboard goodies either. Fast Track tickets cost 29₤ (about 43USD). Same as standard tickets, but here you get priority boarding. Champagne Experience tickets also cost 29₤ (about 43USD). Same as Fast Track tickets, but here you get 1 glass of wine to enjoy while on the ride. For 21₤ more (about 31USD), the Hotel Chocolat Tasting Experience tickets include everything in the Champagne Experience, but the chocolate experience tickets include more wine, an extra revolution (that's one hour as opposed to the regular 30 minutes), chocolates chocolates and more chocolates. Even a box of chocolates to take home! That extra cost alone covers the additional revolution if you were buying tickets separately! For the extra money you are not only getting that extra revolution, but you are getting so much more in return. Well worth the extra money! There is limited space on the specialty tickets, so try to book well in advance. Now as far as the memories you will forever be able to keep, when you arrive at the London Eye you will proceed to the Priority Desk for collection of your tickets. This building is located to the left of the general admission booth. They will give you a Hotel Chocolat goodie bag while they are printing your tickets. Then, you will wait in a private area located inside the café until your tour begins. When that time does arrive, a London Eye staff member will greet you in the café and take you on your journey. You will go around the huge lines directly up to a capsule bypassing everyone else. As you go around two complete revolutions, you will learn about chocolates, samples chocolates, enjoy some champagne, all while taking in the breathtaking London skyline. It's something you will cherish forever.In Paris, I will never forget the Eiffel Tower. Rome, the Colosseum. Budapest, the baths. But in London, it unquestionably will be the time I had on the London Eye!! I highly recommend it (even if you don't go on the chocolate tour).",Shambles!!!
"July 14, 2011","As we were visiting friends near london we decided to visit the london eye, BIG MISTAKE!  All I can say is that it was an utter shambles.  when we first arrived the queue was huge but as it was early we decided to give it a go.  30 mins later it broke down, not one of the many staff said a thing but another visitor gave us a number we could ring later in the day to see if it was up and running.We continued with our day and after ringing we returned at 3pm.  One of the staff told us it would be a 35 min wait so we were quite happy with that.  2 and a half hours later we actually got on the eye!!!!  The queuing system was a shambles and the staff who were supposed to be controlling it could not of cared less.  It really was awful and an embarassment to anyone english.  The ride itself was ok but ruined by the marathon wait.  Never again!!",Go see the view from St. Paul's instead
"January 5, 2007","We thought about seeing the London Eye in Aug.'06, but the long lines (2, in fact -- one to buy tickets; one to get on the Eye) and the high price dissuaded us. One can get a far better view of London (and a larger overall view), by going to St. Paul's Cathedral. Admission to the cathedral is about 1/4 the price. After viewing the interior and the Whispering Gallery, one can take stairs up inside the dome to 2 different exterior levels.One caveat is that one has to climb a lot of stairs, but the views are fabulous, and well worth the effort. Unlike the Eye, where one can only see a small part of London from across the Thames from Parliament, from atop St. Paul's, one can see the whole sweep of London. Being in the centre of the old City of London, one can see all of the original city, with views across the Thames to the Tate Modern and the Globe.This is a real bargain!",Buy the timed entry ticket
"September 16, 2006","The queues can be horribly long at times so be aware of that before you go.  You can purchase a ""timed"" ticket which lets you show up at a specified time and bypass the horribly long ""standard"" line.  Yes, the timed ticket is a little more expensive,  but if you have access to the internet you can buy your tickets directly from their website and save 10%. The eye is built on the banks of the Thames right at the Marriott County Hall Hotel which can be rather overpriced.  There are some good deals to be had on the weekend rates.  Savvy and budget travelers will probably want to stay in the Premier Travel Inn London County Hall...same building as the Marriott but at 1/2 the price!  hint:  there is an internet cafe directly across the street from the entrance door to the Premier Travel Inn County Hall where you can purchase your timed tickets at 10% savings.",Good thing to do
"January 21, 2006","I booked my flight before I left for England. I had heard from friends that doing it at night was awesome. So I went with that. When I went on a Monday evening in January it was pretty empty. My capsule was just me and a couple. Anyway at 6PM the views of the city all lit up were amazing. I would do this it doesn't take much time 30 minutes plus some waiting if it's busy and it's not too expensive, only about 12 pounds. I would pass on the panoramic guidebook though as it's pretty useless. It costs 3 pounds and you can pick out the buildings that it tells you about.",Bargain prices this time of year
"August 14, 2005","At the moment, a certain website that contains the words last and minute are doing a great deal.  Yesterday, I went on the London Eye and also the London Eye Riverboat Cruise for a grand sum of just over £11.  The cruise is 40mins and comfortable and interesting.  Really don't think I need to comment on the London Eye!  Book it ASAP!",Birds Eye View
"September 20, 2003","The only disappointing thing about this ""Wheel of London"" or ""London Wheel"" as it used to be called and is now known as ""The London Eye"" is that it truly does not seem to fit with the scenery around it. But then again, neither do any of the modern buildings that have replaced some of the more beautful classical ones. The wheel at least does have a history here and has been around in some shape or form for over 100 years. It is a part of the city's history and it has an incredible view of the city from it. You can see all the historical landmarks from one central location. Some of the best pictures you will be able to take of the city will be from your 40 minute turn around the wheel. It's definitely well worth it and I would recommend it to anyone who is visiting London.",Saddly no champagne
"October 17, 2021","We were set on the champagne experience, however when we walked up to the Visitor Center at 11 AM on a weekday to buy tickets from the terminal there, it appeared that the only time slots at 3 and 4 PM  were all filled up. We bought standard tickets, still pricey, and waited in slow moving line for about 30 minutes. Before you board your pod, the crew checks it for any gross dirt or objects left behind, sweeps if necessary, but they do not spray or wipe anything. We had about 10 people in our pod, some were sitting on the bench in the center, most were standing and admiring the view for 30 minutes. We were lucky to have a clear day so it was exciting to see the Buckingham Palace and such from the Eye. Restrooms are available at the Visitor Center and Fish and Chips restaurant is nearby.",Get the fast track ticket!
"April 15, 2013","It was worth the extra money not to wait the long line, since I was there on a nice day. As for the ride itself, you can see a bunch of London's attractions from the Eye itself. I am thrilled by heights so I had a lot of fun. I had a friend who is terrified of heights and he still had a lot of fun, would recommend it ;)",Private capsule - expensive but worth it!
"November 30, 2011","I decided to push the boat out and hire a private capsule for my boyfriend's birthday as he had never been on the London Eye before and I wanted it to be special (well, he did take me to Rome as a surprise for Valentine's day!). It was very expensive but I thought it was worth it to see the look on his face!You can book the exact time you want so I found a website that listed the times of sunrise and sunset and made sure we were on the Eye as the sun was setting :-)You are not allowed to be alone in the capsule so have a ""host"", who pours you champagne (this only applies to private capsules obviously) and offers you chocolates. They can point out landmarks but can also be discreet and not get in your way. It is very handy too to have someone else in the capsule to take your photo!The views are great, the only disappointment I guess is that the trip is so short. We were so busy taking photos it would have been nice to be able to go around again to take in the views! Also we were sipping a glass of champagne and it was only as we were about to 'land' that the host told us we were not allowed to take the bottle with us (something to do with laws regarding carrying open bottles of alcohol on the street); if I had known that I would have drunk more of it as we were going round but I was more interested in taking photos! Still, it was a once-in-a-lifetime event and a wonderful experience.",Amazing View
"July 12, 2011",Riding the London Eye is a wonderful and unique experience! If you ever get the chance to experience it you will truly get a sense of where everything is in London and how amazing it is! You get to see everything from Parliament and Big Ben to Buckingham Palace out in the distance!,Enthusiastic Guide
"May 19, 2011","For a 40 minute tour, we heard a lot of info, and were also entertained throughout, thanks to a brilliant guide.  The other crew were also excellent.  Bought this as an add-on to the Eye, but it was definitely a more worthwhile experience.",Convenience
"May 21, 2018",A very time saving idea that lets you enjoy London's best skyline without spending so much time in line especially if you have a very limited time and you a lot more of places to see.,Amazing
"April 17, 2018","It was really nice to see london and the amazing view of it at the top of London eye. I've been with my wife in our honeymoon, it was recommended to us that we have to sea the spectacular view from the eye. And I'm pleased that I did it. ",No refund policy unacceptable
"September 10, 2017","The booking for our party included 2 elderly people - one in a wheelchair. The staff were very kind to the wheelchair user, however  the other elderly person in the party was unwell and unable to attend. I asked if there was a refund procedure for the ONE unused ticket but was told no refunds could be given. It was suggested that a request for the visit to be rebooked for another date MIGHT be considered. I can see no earthly reason for the ""no refund"" poilcy as the booking did not prevent anyone else from taking a flight on the Eye.  I simply put it  down to corporate greed. I have visited the Eye on 3 occasions with various groups, but this experience has given me a somewhat jaundiced view so I would not consider another visit on principle.",It was Okay
"March 3, 2017","Nothing too fancy or unforgettable to brag about. If you have been up the Paris Eiffel Tower, this will pale in comparison. The ride took about 45 mins, be sure to go to the toilet before boarding the cabin or you will end up torturing your bladder till the end of the ride before you can head to the toilet (About 5-7mins walk). Nevertheless, it is worth going for first timers but not for seasoned travellers who have experienced many of these sites.",OK
"March 8, 2016",I was a little disappointed. I felt I preferred the views from the nearby excellent Westminster Park Plaza hotel!!!,Nice View
"October 15, 2015",Great view... The weather was the best I've seen in all my trips to London. You get a good view of London from the Eye especially when the sun is shinning.Worth taking the ride.,A delightful eyeful
"August 30, 2015",The London Eye at night was worth the queue - especially at this Christmas time with lights from all over the capital giving it that magical feel.,Lovely view......short lineup
"December 17, 2014","We took a ride on the London Eye on Friday May 13th..............approx 12:45.p.m......contrary to all we had heard about wait times, we must have been very lucky because we were in our observation car only 5 or so minutes after we lined up, and we did not have fast track tickets...........we inquired abt them but they cost 10 gbp per person extra ...........I'm glad we didn't get them ! The ride took 30 minutes ,almost to the second, and the views were really good, although I doubt I would go again.....................there is a bench in the middle of the observation car, and it cannot accommodate everyone if the car is full, so the tip is to sit in the middle of the bench in the spot that has a small air filtration unit in front of it........................because the unit is against the window no one will stand there and block your view, and the unit is only a couple of feet high so it will not block your view either, nor will it blow air on you....................it was an enjoyable experience.....we are glad we went",Disappointing: not more than 20 minutes!
"February 3, 2009","Visiting England and London last week end, my son and I went to London Eye Saturday, expecting to be blown away. There was a huge queue for buying the tickets and then another one to reach the capsule. But as you fit 25 people in one capsule, the flow seems continuous. Nevertheless, we were worried about missing another commitment we had afterwards. That’s why I checked my watch just before entering the wheel. 20 minutes later, the tour was already finished! We enjoyed it as it is a really nice attraction, but the duration is far away from the 30 minutes they advertize. We went to the ticket office, asking why it was so short. There, a PR responsible person told us that we enjoyed so much the tour that the time seemed flying for us! As I was not 100% satisfied with this answer, he asked me if I wanted to fill-in a claim form for the management. I do not want to make a fuss, I just wanted to share this poor experience with you.  Please avoid going to the London Eye during peak periods!",Total waste of time and money
"April 28, 2008","I had booked online and was told that the maximum waiting time would be 30 minutes. We arrived to a vedry long queue on a very rainy day! We, therefore, decided to pay the extra to get the fast-track tickets (about double) which entailed a wait for around 20 minutes in a queue while people in the other ""normal"" line were getting drenched in the rain.Finally in the ""pod"" we were totally underwhelmed! The views are nice, even though it was raining, but, frankly, not at all worth all the hassle and certainly not the money. Save your punds for a nice meal in Chinatown!",Great view of London
"August 24, 2007","We have been on a 3 day holiday in London in first week of July as a stop over to the airport after a week in Devon, we had not much time to visit alot of attractions so we will definitely return one day, but we visited one of the most popular sights, the London Eye is a must if the day is sunny and the views are clear.  We enjoyed it, the price for it is a bit above average but it's worthed at the end.  Nice views, if you have not much time to see attractions at least can have a glimpse of them from the London Eye.",Pick a clear day and Prepare for a long wait
"June 11, 2007",A friend and I bought our tickets online to this much hyped up tourist attraction in Mid April. We saved about £4 per ticket by buying a package with Madame Tussauds's front of the line passes. The total was £31.50 (per person) . They asked us to report 30 mins before time.The lines were very long and we had wait about an hour before the actual ride. If you are a seasoned traveller this might not be the highlight your trip. But if you've never been on a plane before or as below the age of 11 you will love the ride. Just make sure you check the weather before.. go on a clear day for better views.,Fun experience
"February 21, 2007","It's a good experience. Come on guys, it's the world's tallest observation wheel. In my opinion, just the engineering aspect of the whole thing made it worth the 30-minute trip.We had Oyster, so the second ticket was free if I remember it right. I definitely wouldn't call it a tourist trap. Anyways, to us it was a very memorable experience.Also, if you show up early enough, there's no line, although it does form pretty quickly during the day. We showed up about 10:15 - 10:30am and didn't have to wait in line. Just bought the tickets (right there in the office nearby) and proceeded to the wheel. There were 3 or 4 other people in the same capsule, so nobody got in each other's way. Those capsules are huge, at least a lot larger than I thought.",Excellant Hotel Chocolat Tasting Experience
"February 18, 2014","My daughter and I visited London for the weekend and decided to treat ourselves with a ""Hotel Chocolat"" Tasting Experience Package, it was beyond good, our expert Lisa was knowledgeable, personable and made the whole experience so memorable. We tried many different types of chocolate on our 1 hour (2 revolutions) trip in a private capsule, learning about how chocolate is made and the chocolate tasting was accompanied by glasses of Prosecco served by two delightful London Eye Hostesses. The whole experience was seamless and most professional, the weather was glorious and that just added to the whole thing. There were tasting guides and 360degree maps in our information pack.We were given a box of chocolates (14 assorted) to come home with and there was a non-alcoholic alternative to the fizzy for those that wished. It was Lisa's birthday on the day and she so obviously enjoys her job so much even that did not prevent her working on her special day. I would recommend this to anyone that loves chocolate, it was well worth the money. 5*, thank you :)","Book a time slot, then have to queue for 1.5 hours"
"July 10, 2013","The London Eye is nothing short of an organisational joke.  You book a specific time slot, and then you still have to queue for 1.5 hours to get on.  You finally get on half an hour after your allotted time, and the staff seem to think that it's normal.It's also quite expensive (circa £18).  Go up The Monument instead, it's much better.",brilliant
"January 21, 2007","we as a family loved the london eye so much that we went on twice , once in the day and at night . we bought the tickets at the eye kiosk and then walked straight on both times . this was half term when it was very busy (feb). we also went on again with frends in july and then again just walked straight on (it was late 19:30 ) the last flight . when we go back to london we would proberly go again !",Discrimination
"November 27, 2014","Booked tickets to take my disabled mum on the eye. Asked when I booked if there were facilities for disabled visitors and was told yes. This was a total lie, when we turned and asked for help we were told that we just had to stand in line with everyony else. My mum was treated like a second class citzen, shame on you Merlin Entertainments.",So disappointing
"October 22, 2014","I had booked a chocolate tasting experience on the London Eye for my husbands birthday and paid directly over the internet.  Unfortunately when we arrived we were told there was a technical fault and the London Eye would be shut for the foreseeable future. We had our money refunded, which was great, however, as we had travelled to London especially for the trip on the London Eye we were very disappointed. We were informed that we could not claim anything back for the money spent travelling to London, nor were we entitled to any sort of compensation. Not even  10% off a future booking or even a cup of tea in the cafe!!!!!!I have exchanged 3 e mails with the customer relations team and have been told in no uncertain terms that they will do nothing to encourage me to re book the experience. I'm left feeling that they are simply a money grabbing company, who care very little about their customers. Would it really be so difficult to give a goodwill gesture following a huge disappointment?? Be warned - if the eye is closed and you've pre booked, you will be treated appallingly by the staff. Don't waste your money - go somewhere else instead. The company which runs the London Eye just doesn't care.",Breath-taking!  This is one thing one must do when visiting London!
"July 17, 2011","This is like the ferris wheel for grown-ups, except you will feel like a kid all over again!  You will have amazing views all around.  A 360deg map is provided which points out all the main points of interests, which is kind of cool how they did that.  Don't let the long line up discourage, it goes fairly quickly.  Tip: there is a camera at one point of the ride that takes a photo of the pod, if you or your party are standing at that particular window you can have your photo taken and be able to purchase it at the end as a souvenir.  Enjoy!",Buy the combined  London Eye & return river trip to TheTower
"March 22, 2011",The river trip lasted 40 mins and was accompanied by a non stop commentary from a guide with detailed knowledge and a sense of humour. You see plenty from the river that you would not easily see otherwise.The London Eye ticket is discounted by 10% if you book for both & you get priority access to boarding The Eye which can save a very long wait. You can choose to go on either attraction first.Note:- Take a street map with you into the Eye as you will be able to identify far more & there is more to see if you stand on the far side of the pod as you enter.,Great view. River cruise excellent.
"March 22, 2011",Did the combined London Eye and Thames river cruise. Cruise the hightlight with 45 mins on the water from the Palace of Westminister to under Tower Bridge and back. Excellent commentary with good mix of information and humour.The views from the eye were excellent especially as was about sunset. Queues relatively short and the bubbles not over full. Could do with reducing the cold air flow into them though.The 4D experience done afterwards although short is very good and woudl recommend staying around for it.,Overpriced and overrated
"June 15, 2010","I have been to London about a dozen times but had not done the London Eye. I was there last month and decided to give it a go.  What a waste of time and money!The ride only lasts about 25 minutes, and you are only at the top for a few minutes. The rest of the time is spent ascending and descending  when the view is not nearly as  impressive. You have to wait in two lines--one to purchase the tickets and one to get on the ride. You can pay extra for a fast-track ticket, but I'm glad I didn't do that. Be sure to view the 4D movie beforehand, though. I liked it better than the ride itself.Despite these complaints, I am going to reluctantly recommend it. Why? Because it's one of those touristy things that most people enjoy, particularly if they are first-time visitors. As for me, I wish I had simply taken another boat ride down the Thames.",Very Boring!
"January 4, 2009",This attraction is expensive and just plain boring. It goes so slow that you don't need the whole hour to view London from there. You've seen it all in the first five minutes and for the rest of the time just sat bored stiff! I definitely do not recommend this attraction for people with young children unless you have something for them to do whilst your on it.,Pricy but fabulous!
"July 11, 2006","Although a bit pricy, I thoroughly enjoyed the London eye.  Last time I was in London it was closed (during a wet winter) so I have wanted to go on it for 3 years.  It's certainly worth doing for the amazing view.  If you want a cheaper option to see the amazing London skyline walk up the 311 steps of the Monument for two pound.   Maybe not as spectacular as the London eye but still has great views (as you can walk right around the observation desk seeing a 360 view).I also enjoyed the london eye river cruise (I purchased this online with my london eye flight ticket).  It was fabulous to relax in the sunshine and sail past all those famous monuments.",No great thrills here!
"June 5, 2006",This is NOT a must do for London. In 10 minutes I was bored. You see the tops of the city buildings and that's about it. It was a waste of time and money for me.,It's no world wonder
"January 28, 2006","This pricey ride is not work the buzz.  It's certainly not a must see.  You go up on this big wheel ONCE for $20.00 I would understand if you see something special while you're up that high, but you don't.  London is a great city, but chances are the weather is too rainy or foggy to see anything more exciting than some clouds from up high.  Skip this and run right to Westminster Abby!",A Truly Amazing Experience!
"January 20, 2006",Im afraid of heights but riding on the London Eye was the highlight of my first trip to England. I highly recommend it.,Do Not Miss This!
"January 13, 2006","A must for anyone to see in London. It is worth the wait. We had a clear day and saw so much.  There is a wooden bench to sit onduring your ""flight"".  It moves very slowly so you do not have a feeling of motion until you look at the horizon.  You should get oneof the booklets at the store at the base so you know what to look for and what you are looking at.",A must do while in London
"October 31, 2005","This is a must ""to do"" while in London.  The view was spectacular, we went in September when the weather was clear.  Like other reviewers I didn't have very high expectations, I've been on ferris wheels before and been in many tall buildings with great views (Empire State Building, Sears Tower, Eiffel Tower, etc.)  and this was the most pleasant of all.  You don't have to try and fight your way to get a glimpse, only to have someone push you along.  The speed is such that you don't even realize your moving, but not too slow that you feel like you've been on it for hours.  The 30ish minutes that it took, seemed like much less as my husband and I were finding building and sight that we had discovered during our week and snapping pictures.  A really great and worth while ride.  It may seem a little costly, but the moments and memories are definately worth it.",The only time go to on the Eye ...
"September 21, 2005","Arrive when it is still light, and time your flight so the lights come on as you make your flight.  Magical.",Superb view of London
"July 30, 2004","The London Eye was a big hit with the entire family (teenagers included!). The view is superb and you can pretty easily identify London's famous sights. We purchased tickets on the London Eye internet site prior to leaving U.S. and picked them up from ticket machine at the Eye. This was incredibly convenient and prevented standing in an enormous line to obtain tickets. The basic ride was fine--although if you have money to spare the champagne flight would be fun! We rode at 7:00 PM, had less than 5 minute wait after we obtained tickets from machine. Riding at night with city lit up would be pretty but harder to identify major sights. Definitely recommend the experience!","Nice view, paid a bit too much."
"December 25, 2023","It was nice to skip the line, and the view was nice but with how short the line was the fast track wasn’t that much needed. Could’ve saved a couple of pounds.",Fun Package!
"September 25, 2023","Amazing views and fun way to get them by riding on the London Eye!  The pods looked very cool.  There is a little bench in the center if you start feeling sick/tired and want to sit down - as you near the top (depending on wind I suppose) the pod did start to sway a bit.  Afterwards, the river cruise was fun; we had a great guide, Kit, who pointed out some very cool landmarks and buildings.",Immense view of London...
"February 10, 2020","We've visited London on many occasion, but this time it was with Wifey and our daughter <3 The London  Eye and it was amazing to experience. It is very very highly recommended ;-) and something you have to do when you are in London.You have an utterly amazing whole view of London, that is only separated by the Thames River =D For those who have a fear of heights, please try it, without any fear :-)",Long queue even with fixed time slot
"May 31, 2019",We had a timeslot but had to wait 45-60 min in queue before we arrived at the entrance. This is not okay why not improve this with fixed timeslot for ticket holders.Once inside was the ride okay.,Very confusing set up
"November 11, 2018","We were walking by the Eye and the lines weren't very long so we decided to give it a go. We were sent to ticketing. Because of poor signage it took a bit to find the building. We got in line for Fast Track tickets. After 20 minutes in line it was finally our turn. The ""Fast Track"" ticket we could buy was for 2 hours later. What's fast about that? Needs better signage, clearer information. We wouldn't have waited in line if we knew tickets were not immediately available.",Great View of London
"July 21, 2015","We purchased the speed pass for just a little up charge. It's definitely worth the extra expense. During busy times, do yourself a favor and spring for the speed pass.",If you get a 2 for 1 you will save!
"March 20, 2015","If you are using transit get a 2 for 1 booklet in the tube station. This will save you a ton of money on things like the london eye. It was a lovely ride and view of the city. Go first thing in the morning to avoid long line ups, it opens at 10 am.",Big Wheel flight of London
"February 20, 2015",It goes so high it feels like you are in a small plane. No other aerial views of London like it. We did a 30 mins trip up at sunset and it was gob smacking beautiful. You can easily get yourself there on the Underground and just walk over the Themes by the Big Ben. Watch out for the London taxis. Be careful of the street vendors don't show wads of money or their prices change.,"The eye is great, the service isn't"
"November 18, 2014","We went for the Champagne Experience, which is basically just the regular but with priority boarding and champagne.As part of this you are promised priority boarding and they tout their new '4D Experience'.I'll start with the '4D Experience'. It's a ridculous advertisment for EDF Energy and is quite cringeworthy. Actually getting into this was difficult, we missed this by a second and were rudely shouted at that we'd have to wait a few minutes. We literally got to the door and it closed. This wasn't a great start.When we eventually got in, we realized what a waste of time it was queuing for this and we might as well have just went to the McDonalds across the corner. It's a poorly done 3D film with the typical 3D gimmick, in this case it was a flying bird that sticks out with the 3D. Eventually it sprays foam at you. Reminds me of the same subpar experience with is available at The Dymanic Earth in Edinburgh. Basically, this /definitely/ should not be something they advertise on the tickets.Next I'll move on to the 'priority boarding'. Our trip was at 8pm and we were told to make sure we were at the 'priority queuing area' 15 minutes before the trip.This queuing area consists of a squashed barriered area next to the 'priority checkin'. After waiting around 20 minutes from the time we were told to be there I can tell you that this is anything but priority. I do know how to queue, I am British, however this was too much, especially when you've paid that little extra to not queue.When we actually got on the eye, it was great. The host was knowledgable and took photos of us and the champagne was decent. However, it still gets a one star review as this I would argue that this particular stage is not difficult for a business. How they sell this and the service inside the place is terrible.Basically if you are thinking of going on the London Eye, don't buy any priority stuff with the expectation you'll not have to queue and save your time -- don't go to the 4D experience.",Discusting service
"September 1, 2014","I purchased tickets for me and my partner on 19th august, the money was taken from my account and i recieved a confirmation email thanking me for my purchace and to pick my tickets up from the London eye office on the 30th august. When i went to collect these i was told i hadnt baught any tickets, after showing the staff my confirmation email i was left 45 minutes whilst she disapeared, a woman came back with her to tell me my tickets was there but there was a fault with their system so we would have to re-buy tickets evan though i had already paid for them. We had traveled almost 4 hours to visit the London eye and didnt evan get to go on it as the staff was arguing with us for so long we no longer had any time left. To make things worse this was a surprise for my partners birthday as hes always wanted to visit this attraction, but we was turned away with no help or answers as to why we couldnt have our baught tickets and had to return home upset and disapointed. We was also told that the customer services wasnt open on a saturday so they couldnt help us either.Waste of time and money!",Expensive experience
"June 28, 2014",Good experience but expensive.. long queues but didn't take too long to get onto the eye.. maybe look for 2 for 1 vouchers,Shame on you EDF and London Eye
"January 18, 2014","Friends of mine from Greece came to visit in London for 6 days over the new year (2014) and booked and paid for tickets online via the timeout website. As they were travelling they didn't have a printer to print out the vouchers but they were given a reference email from the site confirming the booking for the given date.We arrived and went to the collections line. we queued for 20 minutes and once at the counter, they told us they couldn't accept the booking with the reference from anyone else's website except theirs and we would have to forward the confirmation email to their email which they gave us. However, the 3G signal in that area is awful so my friend had trouble sending the email. So we re-joined the line and whilst in it, he managed to send the confirmation emails to them. So, after another 40 minutes of queuing (the line was getting longer) we arrived at the counter. The staff member said they had received the emails but for some reason when they clicked on the links for the vouchers, nothing happened. So, we'd done everything they asked and then they told us they wouldn't honour the tickets and if we wanted to go on it, we'd have to pay again. When we complained about this, they simply said ""if you had bought them from our own site, you wouldn't have this problem"". Well, that may be so EDF/London Eye, but YOU authorise other agents to take our money from THEIR sites so you SHOULD honour those tickets. They made no attempt to call ""Encore"" (the company that sells the tickets via the timeout website) and only gave us the option to pay again.Needless to say we weren't going to pay another £55 for 3 tickets (its excessively expensive for 30 minutes anyway). they gave us a ""voucher refusal"" form and said we would have to seek a refund from the people we booked with. Even though everything has been sent off, my friends are STILL waiting for their refund (in late January) with not even a response. EDF/London EYE - firstly you should always honour tickets issued by your agents and secondly if your agents are dodgy (as clearly Encore are for not even responding to the refund request), you should cut ties with them. If you aren't willing to honour tickets issued by other websites, then make your own site the only place to buy them - stop being so greedy!.its an appalling reflection on EDF , the London Eye and damaging to the reputation of the great city of London for the many tourists that come here.Finally, don't waste your money on this attraction or the greedy company behind it - if you walk along the south bank, there are many more interesting things to see that are for free. Shame on you EDF and London Eye!",LONDON EYE - NOTHING SPECIAL IN MY OPINION
"January 8, 2014",We recently took a trip on the London Eye:When we arrived the queue looked VERY long and we were apprehensive about there possibly being a very long wait - this was not the case we could not believe how quickly the queue was moving - we waited about 25 minutes from joining the queue to boarding the Pod.As there were about 15 people who boarded in front of us we could not get to the end of the capsule / `pod` riverside where the best views are - the first people to board will naturally immediately go to that area of the Pod - they will have great views of the Houses of Parliament / Big Ben and the Thames - those who are not in that position will NOT !It may be because I have experienced the view from tall buildings in both London and elsewhere in the World and I used to do sport parachuting as a hobby [views from thousands of feet up] - but I did not think much of the limited views of London that we experienced from our position in the pod.The organisers would probably state that you should ask people to rotate around the pod - the people on our pod were holding onto the handrail with a `vice like grip` - not because they were frightened of the heights - but to prevent themselves being moved from `Their position` !Some people did try to take photos between / above them - any moving was fiercely resisted by maintain their grip on the handrail !It is not possible to ensure that your party will be the first to board a particular pod as this is done with the London Eye still moving - staff marshal people off each pod as it arrives at ground level and it then moves along a few metres to where people have been held in position to `Rush On` - again while the pod is still moving.IF You are very lucky and find yourselves at the front of the line waiting for the next pod - Great - rush onto it and go straight to the riverside end where you will see some good views of London - although apart from the nearby buildings of note you would not know what you are seeing further away.Any view to the south is not really worth seeing - e.g. Crystal Palace Transmitter tower - ?Although the pods are very stable there was some slight movement near the top of the rotation because of some strong winds - one of my Family members found out for the first time that they do not like heights just after the pod started to go up and they had to sit down for nearly all of the rotation / trip.In our pod there were mainly tourists - probably this was the case in all of the pods after all of the years that the London Eye has been operating - I did not get the impression that they were overly impressed with the `ride`.We had complimentary tickets and I am pleased that we experienced it but I would not have felt that it was money well spent if I had paid approximately £100.00 for 5 tickets.Chris,Disappointing - watch out for combitickets
"April 30, 2013","I bought a combi ticket for The London Eye - Madame Tussaud's - The London Dungeon.I bought it through the website of the London Eye.I found the London Eye itself disappointing. It looks great, has a great location but I got a better view of London from the Tower Bridge and the top of St-Paul's cathedral. Also, the picture that is taken during the attraction only contained the backs of people.I also felt cheated with the combiticket. We decided to visit Madame Tussaud's and The London Dungeon on our last day of vacation (tickets valid for a month). Madame Tussaud's was great, we had an excellent time but dissappointment came when visiting the London Dungeon.We had foreseen 2,5 hours to visit the attraction and then we still had over an hour to get to the eurostar.There was a queue and after about 30 minutes, we were able to enter the building. On their website, it states (quote) : ""The tours last approximately 90 minutes no matter what time you enter."". Well, I find that to be misleading. When you 'enter' the building, you still have to queue for 50 minutes and after that, you still need 90 minutes for the show. So in fact you don't need 90 minutes after you 'enter' but 140 minutes. So, we talked to the people of the attraction, told them that we would miss our train and they were very friendly and helpfull and showed some real concern, they suggested that we would return to the London Eye (because we purchased the combiticket there) and simply ask for a refund (or extend the validity of the ticket,...). No complaints there.When we returned to the London Eye ticket office, however, they couldn't have cared less. The person at the counter refused to do anything about it (""it is a combiticket, no refund"") and showed absolutely no interest whatsoever (he constantly looked the other way while is was talking).When I pointed out that the people of the London Dungeon made the suggestion to come back to the ticket office, he stated that, although they sold combitickets, they remained separate firms and that he didn't care what they had sad.Bad service.",Fabulous
"January 12, 2013","We went on the London Eye at 4pm on a Staurday afternoon.  Short queue to buy tickets, followed by a short queue/wait of about 5 minutes to get on.It was just starting to get dark so during the 30 minute ride the Eye lit up with blue lights and lights switched on across the city so it was very pretty.We only had 10 people in our capsule, but as this was my 4th time on the Eye, i know they flll them up at busy times.Our children, age 8 & 6, loved it, especially the computer screens showing interesting points/buildings. The Eye moves very slowly so you dont feel any movement. If you are travelling into London by train look out for the ""buy 1 get 1 free"" booklets at your local train station.  We grabbed one of these and use the vouchers for the Eye.",A must do on a day out! Tanith our tour guide was the best!
"July 7, 2023",This was the best river tour! I had such a lovely time seeing all the sights and enjoying the sunshine! Even as a Londoner myself I learnt so much I didn’t know about the city! Tanith our lovely tour guide was AMAZING! She was so funny and so informative! Really made the whole tour a fab thing to do on a day out! Thank you Tanith you were brilliant! And thank you to the whole crew for a great tour from start to finish! X,Missed Opportunity and Missing Features
"July 6, 2023","I would consider this of dubious value. Yes, you get a nice ferris wheel ride to see London from a high altitude. What is missing is any identification of what you're seeing, which is a tremendous missed opportunity on their part, in my opinion. There should be some identification in the car of what buildings / highlights are in what part of the tableau below. There is something you can download to your phone while there that may provide some of that, but I found it impossible to do that. It might be worthwhile to attempt to download that before arriving at the site.In addition, they advertise the following: ""Enhance your visit with an immersive 4D experience that delves into the history of this iconic attraction."" This is not in existence, and apparently hasn't been for some time, if ever. Nobody seemed to know anything about it. Whether the Fast Track tickets (roughly $19/person extra) are worth it would depend on the crowds at the time of your visit, and your tolerance for waiting. I would guess it cost us $95 extra and saved about 15 minutes of waiting time",Must do activity when visiting London especially for the first time
"July 5, 2023",Fantastic experience. A must-do for any visitor who wants to get a 360° view of London. The ride is great even for those afraid of heights since each pod accommodates 12-15 people and you can sit on the bench in the middle if you are afraid of heights.,Great overall perspective!
"July 5, 2023",Literally one of the top attractions in London. A great way to get a Birds Eye overview as you soar about the London panorama.  It was a fabulous introduction for my young grandchildren. And I never tire of the view!,Worth a look
"July 5, 2023","It was ok, we went when it was really quiet and there were only two other people in the cart which was good (however, they could have been put on the next one and we could have had it to ourselves, as we were still wearing masks at the time), views are good but having been in the news building and shard was slightly less exciting.Great if you've never seen London from a height, and works out well if you buy a merlin multi pass. (Was before sept 22 but my post didn't post)",Great Trip
"July 4, 2023","Very good trip, the queue was huge but rather organised which is a bonus! From start to finish it took 1hr, which wasn’t too bad! The photo area at the end is pretty much a free for all - could do with a rethink!",Average
"July 4, 2023","We visited on 2nd July 23. We ordered tickets online on the same day a couple of hours prior to our ride. When we arrived the queueing system was chaotic. Our tickets said standard entry, so we got into that queue, then after waiting for a while we were sent to the fast track queue. From thereon the line moved steadily. At one point we were photographed in front of a green screen. The ride itself took around 30 minutes and gave us really good panoramic views of that area of London. The big downside was whilst on the ride there were several opportunities to have your picture taken by automated cameras. The photo points were all designed to try and get customers to pay for several photos or a minimum of one. We didn't like the pictures of our group, but hadn't planned on buying it anyway, but the price wasn't displayed anyway. At £38 each the ride didn't represent value for money, especially when compared with the Sky Garden which has better views and is free.",Fabulous thank you Simon
"July 4, 2023","Fantastic tour, made brilliant by Simon the tour guide. His knowledge was extensive even as to which bridges were in films etc and about actors as well as the history of all the he sights along the route .Also want to wish him luck for his next job ,as this was his last day. Very luck we were on his last tour as it was exceptional.He will make a fabulous mad hatter.!",Must to visit if you have just 1 day for London to check
"July 4, 2023","Register first as you come, or better before you go. There is already time wait list till you can go to queue. I have used ""wait time"" to visit sea life museum.",Well worth it
"July 4, 2023","We pre booked online so simply had to collect tickets then had to queue which was no more than 2 mins. The weather was bright and clear so our view was amazing, I'd bought a mini guide which pointed out what all the buildings were so that helped. The capsules move very slowly, you wouldn't even know they were, and feel very safeIt's definitely a must see attraction",Nice Views Over City
"February 11, 2011","This is the type of attraction that you have to go to once, but I don't think I would return.  We showed our return train tickets and coupon from daysoutguide.co.uk to recieve 2FOR1 pricing so we found that to be a good price.  After less than half an hour standing in line and waiting we were off on our trip. It was exactly what I was expecting.",Go - but get the Fast Track tickets!
"January 31, 2011","My 9yr old and I went on the London Eye, had bought the fast track tickets as someone else on Trip Advisor suggested, oh yeah, well worth doing. If we hadn't would've been in the queue for ages. Book online, get fast track, print off email documentation (there's details in email if you're using someone elses credit card to book) and present yourself at the office opposite the attraction to book in (go to desk on the left - priority boarding think it says) you go via a different route and beat the whole queue. The trip itself was great, went in evening - awesome to see all the lights of the city twinkling below. 9yr old enraptured! Best part of the trip. Lovely little eating spots all along the riverbank there. Lovely evening to meander about. Recommend!",London Eye....reservations
"November 3, 2010","Was recently in London and decided to book tickets on-line for the London Eye.  When booking on-line, you must choose a time for your ""ride.""  We booked a 2pm time and was advised to get there 30 minutes early.  We were actually in the area much earlier and ""killed"" an hour watching street performers.  We waited on line for about 15 minutes to pick up our tickets and then was told the line would be about 30 minutes...it actually took us an hour on line...when we got up to the front of the line, we noticed that people were getting on the attraction who had tickets for 7pm that night...I asked the person working there why they were allowed on now, even though they had ""reservations"" for 7pm and he told us it didn't matter what time you had tickets for the ride...you just needed tickets.  The moral of the story is...the ride was worth it, but go when it works best for you and plan to wait in line for an hour....not the 30 minutes they tell you.",Good views.
"August 11, 2010","It's a bloody big Ferris wheel, but at least it don't squeak and sway and rock, and scare the living bejesus out of you. It offers some great views, and even if you're only taking the same photo as ten million other tourists have already done, it's still worth it to have a look for yourself. Yeah, it's expensive, but everything is these days, and it's money better spent than some tourist traps can offer. At least you know what you're getting. It takes you up, you look down, everyone's happy. And at least your wallet will be lighter and easier to carry...you've gotta try and see the good in everything.",Well worth the money - book ahead to save a bit
"January 10, 2009","This was one of the highlights of our trip.  We booked on the BA website and the cost was $60 for 3 tickets.  30 minute ride, fantastic view on a lovely day.  Purchase the London 360 guidebook, a nice keepsake and tells you what you're looking at.  Lines are long but it moves pretty fast.  If you pre book you save some time, as you don't have to get into the long ticket line, but you do still have to wait in the pre booked ticket line. After that you line up again in the ticket holders line, which is a bit twisty turny like a Disneyland ride line!  Staff is well organized though and it moves rather quickly.  Note if you pre book you still have to call up 24 hours in advance to book a time.  You can get there a bit early and they'll still let you line up.  The ride is smooth and unless you have a major phobia about heights it's not scary, even for young children.  There's a seat in the middle if you want to relax, but most everyone stands to get the best view.",Truly Breath Taking
"July 22, 2008","A must go -- especially at dusk and twilight! Well worth the GBP, but buy your ticket(s) early so that you don't have to wait in the ticket queue and then in the time queue. Bring your camera! Buy the book and take it with you before the voyage, so that you can recognize the buildings as you are seeing them from above. Take photos of yourself in the capsule! ENJOY.",A fun and unique experience
"August 22, 2007","My family of four loved this ride taken in July 07.  It is expensive, even more so because we chose to use the fast track tickets which I recommend if there is a long line at the regular ticket counter and/or outside at the Eye. We thought it was awesome because:  the ride is unique - we'd never been in a clear pod-like ferris wheel and the views were cool at that height. It was our first day in London so it was a perfect way to start our holiday. We felt comfortable on the ride as there was plenty of room to sit and walk around.  The height did not bother us as we thought it might when we looked down, but no problem. Each pod holds about 20 people. The 30 minutes ride time seem good also. Although the ride keeps moving it was easy to get on and off. Fun! - if you can bring yourself to ignore the cost.",Essential viewing
"August 7, 2007","The London Eye is a must see experience- even for those of you who are scared of heights, like me. Costs about £15 but at this time of year, when it's very busy, opt to pay the extra £10 and skip the que - you'll feel guilty for a few minutes but saves lots ""and lots"" of queing.Can hardly tell you're moving as moves so slowly and , for those of you scared of heights, it's not that bad. Don't get me wrong, i wasn't jumping around in the capsule but i felt relatively secure.You will be treated to a view of London that is impossible to get from anything other than a hot air balloon.",Better at night
"July 5, 2007",I been on this during the day and most recently at night. The night view is fantastic and since it was a clear night we could see for miles!Didn't have to que at all just went up bought the ticket in City Hall and went straight through so can't complain.Get a Oyster Card fro travellling around London and it also offers a 2 for 1 deal on the London Eye so at £13.50 for two adults its well worth it!!,Eye View
"November 28, 2006","The experience itself was fine but too expensive. We were bringing our grandchildren (ages 12 and 14) to London for the first time, so I thought it would be a good thing to do as an introduction. They were both rather bored and liked the view from Parliament Hill in Hempstead Heath more.",What were you thinking!
"November 3, 2012","In a city with such a rich history like Londons,  it baffles me why your city planners would allow such a monstrosity to be built. It is a blight upon the skyline, a monument to tackiness, an eyesore of the first degree, and has left your great city  looking like a roadside theme park. How about a roller coaster in Trafalgar Square? Please dismantle this horrid contraption!",ugly and doesnt look safe at all.
"July 15, 2012",the worst is smell. During warm days a mix smell of people and chemistry is not acceptable at all. Its a nightmare. More of that you wont feel safe there and the whole round is more than 25 minutes so there`s no way you will make your trip shorter if you dont like it.,Flexi Fast Track is the way to go
"June 26, 2012","I can't imagine being in London and not taking a trip on the eye, but the lines are CRAZY!!!  We purchased our tickets in advance (I recommend this for everything in London if available).  On top of on-line advance tickets , we didn't want to be locked into a particular time, so we spent the extra $ on the Flexi Fast Track ticket.  It was perfect, we spent no more then 10 minutes in line and we could pick the most convenient time for us.  The views are great as well.  Don't forget to smile for the photo opt at the end of the ride.  I would have liked to have gone a 2nd time at night, but decided not to spend the extra $.",use tesco vouchers
"April 12, 2012","great little trip especially when using the vouchers, otherwise it would be too expensive",London eye at night
"October 10, 2011","First time we was there on day. I recommend to go on London Eye when is weather nice if you want see all from there and have a nice photos. My boyfriend are enjoy in view but for me was the best 3D Film what we was watch before we are go in Eye. Next time we was there at night and it was rain, that was most perfect night in London. The Eye are change color from  blue, pink, green and it s look beautiful.",Take the Champagne Experience
"August 28, 2011","After reading a Trip Advisor Review took the suggestion of the champagne experience.  Well worth the few pounds extra.  Was an escorted trip in the capsule and there were only 8 of us, when the capsule can take up to 25.  Also had an allotted booked time so didn't have to wait in long queues, and there are long queues.  Our guide was very pleasant and pointed out sights of interest.  Would thoroughly recommend.",A visit to London without a ride in the eye is like going to sea without swimming
"June 15, 2011","The only thing that would make your experience even better is if you can grasb a 2-for-1 voucher or something like this. I know some businesses do offer them (Tescos to mention one). Also, you would get an online discount if you pre-book your ticket which what I did. This also proved clever when I went to collect my tickets from the machines and I saw that huge queue at the tickets office, while it took me two minutes to get mine. So, try to book in advance. As for the ride itself, it was just amazing, especially if your going to stay in London for a short time and you cannot see everything it has to offer. I really enjoyed it. The view of Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, etc, is amazing. You might also consider going at night if you love the glamorous nights of London...The last amazing thing was the London Eye 4-D experience which was included in the ticket. It was a short movie in 4-D which we saw after getting off the wheel..Overall, money well spent..",2 for 1 discounts / # of persons per pod

"March 21, 2011","Booked a ticket for 10am thinking the queues wouldn't be too bad - how wrong can one be?  Probably because it was a beautiful spring day.  Arrived 9.30am and had read that if you booked into the 10am slot, you could do the 4D experience after going on the eye.  We booked our tickets on-line and the queue for collection wasn't as bad as the queue for buying tickets although we did get in the wrong one at first because it wasn't very clear.  There was no-one on the door when we entered hence the confusion but we found out there should be someone on the door directing you to the right queue.  We were hurried through the 4D experience before our trip which meant we finally boarded at 10.40ish.  I though it was a pleasant experience and the views are fantastic, the weather helped but I was ready to get off mainly because the temperature was getting hotter and hotter and I felt like I was in a greenhouse.  Hopefully they have air conditioning on in the summer!   I'm glad I did it, would recommend it, but wouldn't do it again.",Worth the money?
"March 10, 2011","I went on the 8th March and there was no queue so the fast track ticket I purchased was not really necessary.  The ride was shorter than I had been led to expect. The view was good. The ride moves really really slowly-you don't even know youre moving. They take your capsules photo at the end, but since other random people are in your capsule with you i don't really dont that photo desirable and didnt buy it. They take your photo again when you enter the 4D video theatre (where there are no seats) and again i didn't buy it. The background isn't anything special. ","Interesting enough, once you are on it. Terrible ticketing and queuing system."
"May 9, 2017","A family group of 10 purchased tickets online for a timed 'flight' at 2.45. We turned up just after 2.00pm to discover you had to join the general queue to exchange our online tickets for actual tickets. This pointless process took 40mins. Once we had our actual tickets we were then instructed to join another queue to board the ride. This is possibly the worst planned queueing system I've ever experienced. You join the queue and snake around until you reach the wide walk way called Southbank which runs next to the river.You are then stopped by an employee and when space allows you are released to cross the walkway and join the second part of the queue on the other side.  We eventually boarded the ride at 3.50pm for a 2.45pm flight. We had prepaid, timed train tickets leaving London at 4.20pm and with the ride taking 30mins we had to miss our train. We tried to explain to 3 different staff members how unhappy and frustrated we were. They were so disinterested or poorly trained that any expression of dissatisfaction was greeted with the answer - ""I don't have to tolerate being shouted at"" or something of the like. (Which we weren't.) We eventually asked to see the duty manager who possessed equally poor customer service skills and referred us the a website complaints procedure. The 30mins you are on the eye is quite interesting but sadly not good enough to out weigh the hassle of trying to get on. I can't help wondering how many of our foreign visitors also have a shocking experience but just don't bother complaining. This is an over-priced rip off and Coca Cola should be ashamed of their association with this tourist trap.",Great ONLY with Fastpass tickets
"April 29, 2017","The iconic eye is a lot of fun.  It is everything you would expect it to be: a quirky attraction with great views and a cool experience.  I thought that the height would be an issue for some in our group, but it wasn't at all.  The pod is very big once in it, and it feels like you are standing in a high building, rather than a ride.  The movement is hard to notice.  One note one this- pay the extra money to get the ANYTIME Fastpass.  The wait is otherwise hours long. Even those with timed advanced ticket passes were waiting at least an hour.  It is very important to note that once you have the anytime pass you must go directly to the base of the wheel to the only real fastpass line (not to any of the other 5-6 ticket entrances). The other entrances will give you a new timestamp ticket, often for a much later time, even with an anytime ticket. Not sure if this is a ploy to thin out the crowd or the numerous uninformed workers.  This happened to us (we realized and ditched it) and many others who often realized too late.  Once we knew where to go, we literally walked on the wheel past 100s of others.  Well worth it!",Incompetent staff and no customer service
"April 3, 2017","We had looked forward to a great river cruise with fantastic weather and booked our tickets in advance online. We arrived more than 15 minutes before the scheduled departure. Upon boarding, we were told we can only sit inside because the upper deck was full. The inside offers very limited views and was completely stuffy and warm. When we asked if we could take the next boat, we were told to go to the ticket office and they would take care of us. After waiting in line for another 15 minutes at the ticket office, we were only then told there would be a £10 change fee per ticket. After asking to speak with a supervisor, we were told the same thing. Very rude, incompetent and misinformed staff, both on the boat and at the ticket office. The supervisor has the authority to make decisions about as much as a random head of cabbage. Zero sense of customer service. We reviewed the online ticket offering and there was no mention anywhere of not being able to choose inside or outside seating, nor a mention of any change fees.JUST REALLY BAD SERVICE AND ZERO CUSTOMER CENTRICITY!!!There are enough other cruise offerings available in London, which I have personally experienced and are much more centered on the customer experience than this ""company"".In case someone from the Coca-Cola Company actually reads this: Do something with the staff here -- it is tarnishing your brand!Overall: FIND ANOTHER BOAT CRUISE TO TAKE. WE WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ONE. ",£100 for family of 5 and long queues 
"March 5, 2017",The attraction is good but highly overpriced for a 45 minute experience and extremely long queues. The main point is a view of Big Ben. You can get a better view for free 3 minutes away at Westminster bridge. The other sites are too far away to get a good view of. The queues are very long even with prebooked tickets. Tip is to prebook standard tickets online and go for the earliest time. Beware on the website that the tickets offered are more expensive tickets. You need to look for the standard tickets.,"Rudeness manner/behaviour/attitude of  FAZIL (fast track on duty ""desk staff"")"
"September 2, 2016","On Sept 2,  2016 (friday @ 12. 25 noon time)...a duty ""desk staff"" of fast track named FAZIL was NOT accommodating in his TONE of voice (as if he was  shouting to a deaf ,  non-english spreaking person)· This was seen, heard & observed by all of us in the queue ,  while he was impatiently  giving instructions to a certain elderly tourist couple about their tour voucher document of where to go in another queue from his desk.  When it was my time,  it was the same tone of voice as if no respect and courtesy even I greeted him pleasantly first.   When I responded and  he heard me speaking in English with an appearance of not happy of his tone of voice and general non-coutreous manner,  he pretended to continue (but still in an unfriendly manner / behaviour) the transactions I basically need that time (advance booking tickets for my guests and me). To get even to me and to continue his non-professional customer service behaviour,  he then brisckly ( as if in a throwing manner) placed my  tickets and reciept to a distant side of his front desk INSTEAD of handing it to my hand (like the other customers ahead of me ).   I told him straight that it's very rude to do that plus his behaviour / attitude in serving me.... And he bluntly said he doesn't care .. And added,  I was the one being rude conversing to him. As i left the fast track counter,  I then asked other staffs nearby of whom to report / escalate the incident to any duty manager that very time of that day. A very accommodating and friendly female manager named RACHEL JOHNS introduced herself and listenened about my grievances / complaints against the said staff (FAZIL),... she gave me an official ""complaints / praise"" document entitled ""London Eye Experience"" and waited for me to right the incident. While I was writing the incident another male manager (named SYDNEY) approached me and introduced himself as the direct manager of FAZIL.   He did asked questions regarding the incident as if he incriminate that it might be racism in my part of observing and reporting the matter... But I explained to him it is MORE on the manner / attitude/ behaviour on the point of a front desk customer service.  But,  it seems though that he was defending his staff (as if it was my fault and my behaviour that triggered the staff's behaviour) in my disposition and presence on that time of reporting / escalating the incident.  This was heard and witnessed in front of the other female manager (Rachel Johns) before the male manager (SYDNEY) left me ( bid me good day and hoping the incident wont ruin our tour). The female manager (Rachel Johns) took the document and promised to give it the the higher administration explaining to me that it's for reporting,  investigation and room for improvement for their service to the general public.   She added that i will also expect a feedback about the matter through my email soon. Respect and courtesy to anyone are the most universal key points of CUSTOMER SERVICE experience.","Great views, a must to do while in London"
"July 21, 2016","My family rode the London Eye in July of 2016. Did we enjoy? Yes. Would we recommend it to friends? Yes. We bought our tickets online thinking that we wouldn’t have to wait in line at the attraction. This was wrong. We had to go wait in line and present our confirmation number in order to get our tickets. We also paid extra to get the Fast Track, thinking this would get us to the front of the line – it doesn’t. The Fast Track only gets you to the front of half the line. I estimate that buying the Fast Track ticket saved us about a 15-minute wait. However, there were 4 of us times £7 per ticket, that 15 minutes cost us £28. I don’t think it was worth it.If you found my review helpful, please let me know that by clicking the Helpful Button.

"October 4, 2015","I simply cannot believe they painted stuff onto the front of the viewing capsules for the Rugby! Fine, Coca Cola, you are sponsor of the Rugby World Cup, and happen to run the London Eye at the moment. This is NO REASON to paint stuff on the front of the capsules (yes, the bit from which you're supposed to be able to see Buckingham Palace and the wonderful parks of London) - instead of clear views, we saw black stripes!The other parts of the window that had no ads on them weren't very clean even though it was a dry day and had been dry for several before, so no excuses there either. There were black spots everywhere - this must not happen at an attraction that makes its money with views. The whole enterprise is also run sickeningly commercial, to a point that I have not experienced before. Everywhere it's ""upgrade this, buy that extra, how about adding on ..."" We were herded in front of photographers not just once, but at three different stages of the experience - photos available at the exit for a fee. Also the 4D experience - which I had thought to be a nice documentary flight over London - turned out to be nothing but a several minute advert for the London Eye: Random pictures of happy people and quick views of London cut together. Total waste of time. Yes, they do offer the best views over London, but at this price, waiting times (which can be absolutely horrendous and stretch the recommended visiting time from 30 minutes to closer to 2 hours!), and all the above points, I'll stick to looking at aerial pictures of it in the future.",Birthday Present!
"September 14, 2015","Visited as part of a long weekend in London and had purchased the tickets as part of the London eye experience (4 attractions for a great price !)Ride time of 30 minutes just flew by, the wheel hardly looks to move when you are watching from the ground but once you are on it goes too quickly.The pods are spacious with plenty of space to move around in, we had a slightly cloudy evening for our flight but this didn't detract from the views at all, around a 25 mile view out over London and the surrounding areas in 360 degrees, the touch screens within the pods provide plenty of additional information should the views not be enough to hold your interest for 30 minutes.Queue time at 18:00 on a Saturday night we were expecting over an hour, however we were loaded into our pod within 20 minutes, the staff were all very friendly as well.Definitely worth a visit to see London from this vantage point.",Gorgeous view but expensive
"September 12, 2015","Went on a beautiful sunny afternoon.  Line was incredibly long and slow moving.  Decided to pay for fast track admission.  The ticket lady promised it would be a maximum fifteen minute wait.  We timed it and sure enough we were on at about the 15 min mark.  Can't beat the view.  Awesome birds eye perspective.  Got gorgeous shots.   We stood in the area where a camera would take a picture of you from outside the capsule and we got a fantastic family photo!  But it was expensive to purchase.  All in all, a must do when in England but wouldn't do again.",get a combo ticket!
"May 16, 2012","if you dont like to queue, there are fast track option avaialble. Get a combo ticket as you DO actually save money, which we worked out at £30 for 2 of us over the weekend.The eye its self takes around 30 mins all in, and provides great views of central london. We were lucky to have a carriage to oursleves as we stayed in the Premier Inn next to the eye and were the first on the ride in the morning. It opens around 9, and gets busy as sson as it opens",Marvellous views of London!
"May 1, 2012","Having booked E tickets for a group several times, the collection of the actual tickets was quite swift.. This was April and not too busy so we didn't wait long to get inside 'the pod'! It can take a while in the busy Summer season but is well worth it. I'd recommend booking a 'flight' at sunset !!! Wonderful !",Best views in town
"May 1, 2012","This is where you go to really see London - if you get lucky and pick a sunset time then be prepared to be wowed!  I did a champagne flight which was lovely, pricey but you'll only ever do it once. ",Wonderful view of London
"January 21, 2012","My husband and I went to London Eye and we found the Views to be wonderful. We were able to see the different attractions such as big Ben, house of parliament, London tower, and the river Thames. We found it to be enjoyable and relaxing. Although I have a fear of heights I was comfortable on the wheel since it travels very slowly.",Day For Pictures/Night For Eye Candy
"January 9, 2012","We were torn as to go during a clear do or to go at night.As it turned out, we ran out of day and had to go at night.  Our advanced ticket (good anytime that day) was a blessing when it was time to get into line for the ride.The views were very nice at night, but the pictures were disappointing.  If you want to go for the pictures, go during a clear day.I recommend this attraction but not enough ""wow factor"" to go a second time.",A little expensive
"October 12, 2011","Do not get bogged down by the title. It depends on what kind of things attract you.  I was personally a little disappointed with the snail paced giant wheel. Also the whole point of the ride was to get a view of London from the top.  I went with a couple of friends and they shared the same thought.  Take it if  you are the kind of person who enjoys aerial view and stuff like that. Also, I could see a lot of kids getting excite. For me especially at that price, it is thumbs downNote: Check out the london attraction pass which combines London eye with Madame Tussauds, sea life, thames cruise and other combinations. If you book it online, you can avoid the long queue and get some discount too.",Amazing!
"October 8, 2011","We only had standard tickets, and were prepared for a long wait in the queue before we arrived. However, we were so surprised to see how short the main queue was on arrival, and it only took about 25 min to get onboard. Great, considering it was a saturday afternoon! The kids were fascinated by the fantastic views and since our capsule was not too crowded it was easy to get a good look. Really enjoyable experience! In fact, we visited three main London attractions that day, the dungeon, the london eye and Sea Life Aquarium, and the kids all agreed that the London Eye was the best part of the day!",Mirian Does London
"July 16, 2011",The London Eye is a must see.  The views are incredulous.  You must do the 4D experience which is included in the ticket cost.  We followed our trip on the Big Red Bus blue route - lots of languages to choose from on the commentary.  Then we did the Boat trip to Greenwich and back (from Westminster Bridge) included with the Bus ticket. To see the pictures  go to :http://photopeach.com/album/13t4jxq?invitecode=763b37223c,Definitely go for the VIP
"June 29, 2011","We bought our tickets online prior to our trip, and opted for the basic VIP package. Nothing fancy, but allows you to skip the queue. I think it wound up only costing 2 pounds more than the regular admission bought on site (you get additional savings online). When we arrived on a beautiful sunny afternoon, the lineup was horrific. We were able to walk right up to guest services, grab our reserved tickets, and then go through a separate entrance and were on board in less than 5 minutes. I'm sure the line was at least 2 hours! You also get a cool circular map that shows you all of the major landmarks you will see from the top.The London Eye is just one of those typical touristy things that you have to do in London. Great city views and it's a cool experience.",Book online. Be prepared for cloud!
"March 10, 2011","The notorious british weather can really throw a spanner in the works. Unless it is foggy you should still be able to see as far as St Paul's and easily see Big Ben/Parliament as it is opposite!The ride moves so slowly you do not feel the movement; takes a good 20 minutes to go round. worth it if your first time to London. Lovely setting, good place from where to get perspective. And if your glass is half full, a cloudy day may not be bad. If the sun was out you would not be able to take photos in one direction because of the glare and it would reflect off the glass of the bubble. So yes, go for a cloudy day!!! Hopefully you don't end up with one of the two sunny days a year in England!No, really, enjoy it. Worth it.Hey kids: Big Ben/Parliament...",London Eye- A essential experience for any visitor!
"August 9, 2007","Excellent views of London, a fantasic and highly recommended.  We were on very quickly and the pods were not crowded.",woohoo
"June 24, 2007","not good  at all,to be honest i feel it is an enlarged ferris  wheel which is given tooo much publicity",Only if you've got the time and money
"May 25, 2007","After reading all the glowing reviews on trip advisor I made sure to book online when arriving in London to make sure we could get on board without queueing.  It was all organised when we got there, no problem, didn't have to wait long to get on.We were also lucky in that we only had to share the capsule with one other couple so had great access and unimpeded views.  It was good, but it's not like you can take great photos as the capsules are that scratched up plastic material.I would only recommend it to those with heaps of time and the money to spare, it's not a must see or do in London.  I'd rather recommend St Pauls where the views are just as brilliant with no perspex between me and the view (plus all the other St Pauls benefits).","Fantastic, leisurely way to see a big city"
"April 2, 2007","The London Eye has become this incredible sight that, since 2000, has really earned a place on the skyline of London. One can scarcely imagine the South side of the Thames without it anymore. It is the world’s largest observation wheel and gives a unique view of London. We booked our tickets on-line in advance and got a fairly decent price. We arrived a little after the recommend time, but this being a Monday morning, the line was fairly short (<5 minutes). I highly recommend coming earlier in the day as the queue really starts growing with tourists and school groups after 12 noon. We had a beautiful, clear, sunny day and the flight was great, but I think even a cloudy day might still be fun. A nighttime flight must be amazing!To say that the “flight” is fantastic, gorgeous, wonderful and exhilarating would not be overselling it! The Eye itself is a thrilling technological and engineering sight. The wheel moves smoothly and effortlessly and the clear capsules give a remarkable view. The one downside is that there is no map, no narration, no displays, so it is often hard to understand what you are seeing. With other observation wheels or towers like the Washington Monument or Empire State Building, there is usually some kind of signage that tells you what you are seeing. On the London Eye, you are left to wonder – what is that funny large building over on the right (it was The Gherkin), or where is Trellick Tower? And since most of your fellow travelers are also tourists – they don’t have a clue either. It would really add to this experience to have signage that helped you understand what you are looking at.That aside, the London Eye is a fantastic way to seeing one of the world’s largest, more complicated cities at a leisurely pace.","Out of this World, Brilliant, Fantastic and Impressive"
"March 14, 2007","The BA London Eye is truly the number one attraction in Britain. I did the 30 minute trip on March 9 about 2:30 p.m. It’s a short distance away from the Waterloo Station so you better get a train there. The weather was fantastic, a bit chilly and there wasn’t heavy cloud cover. I bought the ticket for £14.50 and just had to wait about 20 minutes before I was able to enter a capsule. The lines are long but they move fast. Security is efficient and once you follow the rules you’ll be through quickly. I also got a guide book for £5 just before I got on with all the views you’ll see and it identified exactly what each was. This was really helpful. Just look at the pictures I’ve attached and see the breathtaking views to be had. There were only 16 people in my capsule and there was enough room for everyone to get around and take loads of pictures. My Sony DC was good enough to zoom in and take a good picture of Buckingham Palace. After the ride, I went into the Gift Shop to get myself some souvenirs. I got some nice chocolate for £1.50 each. Also, a BA draw string bag with a monocular, guide book and key ring for £13.50. I got my friend a mouse pad as well, can’t remember the cost. Overall, it is worth it. I would recommend it to anyone, old and young. Don’t be afraid of the height, it’s only 450 feet above the ground at its highest point. What’s more, the Eye moves so slowing, you barely notice it’s moving. If you stand from Westminster Bridge it looks like if it’s static. On another note, I categorically disagree with the views here that it is overrated and overpriced. That project cost millions of pounds to conceptualise and develop and millions more to maintain yearly. This piece of engineering magic is a definite on your next trip to London.",A must for tourist
"October 20, 2006",Been both in day time and night time. There was a full moon so it looked amazing. Remember to turn camera flash off so you dont get light bouncing off the glass. Yes there are queues and waits but isnt it the same for every tourist attraction in the world? I've had to wait longer for attractions in the states. If you are not in london for long i would do the Eye as you get a birdseye view of the city and you can really take it in. I dont think i realised how beautiful London is (kind of took it for granted living in the next county) until i went up the Eye both times. Then i realised how lucky i was and why people come from all over the world to visit it. It has history and beauty all visible from your pod.,The Queue was long but was worth the wait.
"October 13, 2006","It was the first famous landmark I visited on my first trip to London in March this year. It was a miserable, cold day and I missed my stop.  The big bus people were so friendly. They told me how to get there. I couldn't imagine the different nationalities visiting at the same time. Got to the comfort room first, then a bit of refreshment at Mc.Donald. (However do we survive the hunger and thirst without them?  I joined the queue. It was long. I had to wait for the next intake. The girl at the ticket place gave us some hints so we won't experience the dreaded phobia of heights!I got to sit. Some brave people just stood and looked out. I started chatting with a couple from rural England there on their first visit too. It was the gentleman's 60th birthday present. So his lady and I chatted in between photo taking. As far as wecan see we can behold glorious sights. Excellent view. I would go on it again the next time I visit England.It is a must-see. Forget the long wait to get up there. Just do it.It is worth the wait.Emily RuddSydney, Australia",Loved it!
"August 16, 2006","The British Airways London Eye was truely an amazing experience.  I am a person who is slightly afraid of heights, and I had a great time.  The Eye is very stable and does not shake, so I felt very safe.  The view from the eye was outstanding, and this attraction is a must see in London!",Awesome!!!!
"July 22, 2006",My partner and I loved this.  We found it priced well for the experience and got some great photos of the London.,Wonderful view!
"July 28, 2004","The London Eye was quite amazing.  I'm not sure exactly how they put this thing together but they did a great job.  We went at night and the view was fabulous (everything was all lit up).  Unfortunately, pictures that I tried to take didn't turn out but I bought a post card so at least I have one pic of it!",Must try!
"July 27, 2014","You have to ho on a ride... But there is a fee of course! What I would love would be if they could lower the price in summer or rush-times of the year. OMG all that waiting, the lines are so long before you buy tickets, and even longer before you go on the LE! A killer of the good experience. But you will definately enjoy the ride, great view over London.",Not for those who are claustrophobic or don't like heights!
"May 29, 2014","My friend wanted to do the London Eye - I don't like heights and have a tendancy to panic in small enclosed spaces, so I wasn't too happy with the idea.  The view, if the weather is good, is breath taking: it's a different perspective and needs some thinking before you can identify certain sights you normally see at ground level.  Fortunately, the wheel turns slowly but steadily and the trip is over in about 1/2 and hour: a few more minutes and I would have been having a full blown panic attach!  Would I do it again? No - because I was seriously uncomfortable BUT, if you do not have my issues it is really worth while!",A Bird's Eye View of London
"May 28, 2014","This is an excellent way to get an unusual view of London. You get close-up views of the Thames, Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament and, as you go higher, you can see into the gardens of Buckingham Palace and have a Bird's Eye view of many of the main tourist attractions in London without all the travel. On a good day you can see for 25-30 miles from the top - as far as Dartford and the Thames Estuary. If you get the chance, also have a go at night - the lights of London are spectacular. Although you can just turn up and get a ticket in the less busy times, it is better to book.",Jockey for the best views but be prepared to pay a princely sum for them
"May 20, 2014","Ferris wheels were so romantic in the movies. You think how Ryan Gosling hung precariously by a bar in order to force Rachel McAdams to go out with him in ""The Notebook"". Or go back further and remember how James Dean stole a kiss from a guilt-ridden Julie Harris in ""East of Eden"". Or even further than that in ""The Third Man"" when Orson Welles gave Harry Lime's famous cuckoo clock speech to Joseph Cotten just as they got off the Wiener Riesenrad in Vienna's Prater amusement park. Oh wait, that wasn't romantic, but neither is the London Eye which is somewhat similar to the Riesenrad in that it features compartments rather than seats to accommodate incoming passengers.However, the compartments in the London Eye are actually air-conditioned ovoidal capsules with 360-degree views that can fit up to 25 people at a time. There's a wooden bench in the middle, but people rarely sit on it for the thirty-minute duration of the ride because everyone feels a need to take in all of London while taxing the cameras on their smartphones to no end. That's certainly what Jamie W. and I did as we elbowed our way in front of the views of the Houses of Parliament and all the other majestic sights along the Thames River. We all had to dodge toddlers, extended family units, and delegations of foreign tourists in order to get photos that appear like we are the only ones aboard the capsule. Getting most of the photogenic angles took up the entire ride, that's for sure.For all that effort, the admission is pretty steep, I mean Disneyland-steep. Retaining a vivid memory of the long queues I saw on my last visit to London a decade back, I thought it would be worthwhile to invest in the Fast Track ticket which allows you to skip the longer line to pop right into a capsule. Perhaps on a weekend afternoon, that would have made sense, but on a Monday morning, it was overkill since there was barely a dozen people in the regular line. A Fast Track ticket costs a whopping £ 29.50, which means for the two of us, we spent almost $100 for that half-hour. Hookers cost less, even the ones with good teeth. and shame on the indifferent woman at the ticket desk who didn't bother to point out that the 4D cinema experience was included. They could have at least thrown in a free fridge magnet.",Hate heights avoid it!
"October 26, 2013","I did this yesterday, have always had a bad fear of heights but listened to everyone who said it is not too bad! Honestly, there is not liking heights and a fear of heights.  I felt dizzy, sick, shook from head to toe, it was the worst experience ever, i cannot say enough if you really have a fear of heights avoid this :(",Great and enjoyable
"March 11, 2013","It's a great and enjoyable way to see the city. The fast track was great we did not wait long to ride. I booked online ( London eye, Madame Tussauds and SEA life London) it was a valuable. Really it worth it. Don't miss this attraction.",Could Not Be Better Than This!
"November 15, 2012","Been to London 30 times.  Never took the time to ride the London Eye.  Well worth the 30 minute ride with views that are astounding.  If you are in London and don't ride the Eye, you have wasted your time and money coming all the way to London and not doing this.  It is truly fabulous!!  If you are in London for many days, wait for a clear day so you can really see the sights.  On dreary rainy days it is hard to see that far.",London Eye 2012 Fireworks

"August 25, 2012","My in laws and kids (two teens) LOVED the experience of going on the London Eye. Going on the London Eye allows you to take in the whole view of the city of London, and it is a great orientation. The cars move so slowly that you can barely tell that you are moving, so there is no problem with motion sickness. We enjoyed being high up, but some with a fear of heights might find it challenging. We thought that this experience was a highlight of our whole trip to London and we highly recommend it to others. My advice is to pre-purchase timed tickets at least a day in advance, once you know (based on the weather forecast) that there will be clear skies the next day. It would be sad to get stuck going on the London Eye on a rainy day.",best thing to do in london
"August 25, 2012",London Eye is a must do if you go to london. The weel itself is verry good with large pods that holds 30 people together. The location is great. You get a very good vue of the atractions. The tickets are a bit expensive and the line can be long,Great photo opportunitie and very informative
"March 22, 2015","We liked this 40 minute trip so much last year that we went again  and it was even better this time, with live commentary by a guide who was lively and informative.  Great photos of Houses of Parliament, HMS Belfast, and the reconstructed Globe theatre, amongst lots more.  Highly recommended.",No Good if you suffer from Vertigo
"March 8, 2015","If you suffer from Vertigo then you should not go on this attraction, as standing near the window will start you off and then have to wait what seems like an eternity to get off",Great
"February 24, 2015","We arrived as it opened as we were staying in the hotel next door,  the Q was not to bad but we we were fast tracked by the guy on the gate so only waited about 5 mins,  view was great the only downside was although we were stood where they said to get a photo on the pod, there was no sign of ours after we got off.  But not a problem as we got one done on the green screen when we did the 4d experience which was great.  Which wasn't quite the same but were fantasic photos",Wow
"February 24, 2015",Although I'm not normally a lover of heights. This is a must during a visit to London. Children loved it too. Great views. Although the que looked exceptionally long. The wait wasn't too long at all!! 👍,Avoid the que's and cost
"February 24, 2015",We bought this as a package with the london dungeon (amazing) and maddam tussauds (rubbish) you can get a family ticket for 3 attractions including the sea life centre for as little as £140 I got this on special offer for £120 just with a lucky check of the site. When you book online in advance make this your first ticket as it's the busiest and it becomes a fastrack ticket. We went at 6:30 pm it is an amazing view in the dark! We arrived and walked strait on the wheel! Avoid the que's and cost and this becomes even more enjoyable! ,New Year Fireworks 2015
"January 8, 2015","One of the highlights of my/the London calendar are the New Year Fireworks at the London Eye.I have for the past 7 years without fail attended this fantastic event...some years arriving early (very good) and some years not so early (not so good!).In 2013 I made absolutely certain of getting a good spot on the Victoria Embankment by arriving really early at 12noon and made sure I stayed in the same spot directly opposite the London Eye...good move as I had a ringside seat...so to speak ;)However, this last year 2014, things were spoiled a wee bit by the introduction of a £10 price tag, tickets for which had to be booked in advance and with only 100,000 released as you can imagine they sold out pdq. :( boo hoo. I was totally unimpressed, whilst I do realise the reasoning behind this new format, I was still pretty annoyed LOLAnyway, I didn't buy a ticket (stubborn) and so when I arrived in London to see the fireworks I had to find a new spot.....I eventually ended up on Horse Guards and although I couldn't see the lower section of the display, I along with hundreds of other spectators had a fabulous view of the fireworks as they shot up into the air above the London skyline.What an extraordinary sight!  They really are the most spectacular fireworks you could imagine, with bursts of colour, stunning effects, smiley faces and hearts galore, the sounds still travelled to where we were, albeit not as loud as if you are right there on the Victoria Embankment and the crowd roared as the countdown began, oooed and aahhed at each new burst of rockets with wild cheering at the beginning and end of the display.A fantastic event and a must-see on the London calendar. Do however be aware that this is now a ticketed event and you will have to be sharp about it if you wish to attend.I will endeavour to keep an eye on when tickets are due to be released and post the link on my twitter feed @3days_in_london as well as on the #3DIL App (which is free to download by the way).All the best. I hope that if you are planning a trip to London to see the fireworks that you manage to get a ticket.....if not, then Horse Guards, if it open to the public is a really good spot....but as usual...get there early, this is a very popular event. I must also state that if you are planning on taking children, be prepared for a long wait in the queue and also for crowding after the event when folks want to leave in a hurry.fyi....the London Underground usually has free travel on the transport system from 23:45 - 04:30 on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day...for more information on that visit www.tfl.gov.uk closer to the time.Have a great stay in London. p.s. I have given this a 4-star rating only because of the ticketing of the event. It is in itself a 5+-star event",Terrible experience
"November 13, 2014","Out of everything I did and went to see in London. My experience at the London Eye was the worst. The day I went was what they call a ""holiday"" and because of this was extremely full. I had to be in the ticket line for about 45 minutes, by the time I was able to purchase my ticket they said they only had room for the 4:00 pm and that I need it to be there 30 minutes earlier. I left I came back at 3:15pm and there was HUGE line to get to the ride. I got in line and the employee asked me to get out because it was not my time, so I did. At 3:30 pm I got in line where they explained that it was over an hour wait to get in to the ride. I was outraged!!!! How can it be over an hour wait?! They already know the capability of the ride, how can it take you longer to get there even if its a holiday. I told them that was not acceptable since I Had complied with all of their directions and when I wanted to get in line earlier they did not wanted. They only explanation that they gave me was that it was a holiday. That is ridiculous.... You know what is your volume and capacity of people per time and need to accommodate personnel to comply with your schedule. I went in and requested a refund, had a very difficult time to get the refund because they thought I should understand that it a holiday. What they don't understand is that I am on vacation on a extremely tight schedule and don't have time to waste for ride that cost over $30 for only 30 minutes. After a while I did get a refund. It is not worth your time and money. Personnel was not helpful and treated me like they were doing me a favor instead of understanding that they were being paid to accommodate for each individual paying them. DONT waste time and money on this attraction. Lots of other things to do and see in London.",The London Eye - One of the most terrifying ride in the world
"November 4, 2014",So we went to The London Eye. It looked like a giant Wheel but near a river. It was weird because people would pay money to sit in these little cars as it went round.It got very high and I saw Big Ben at night.I properly bricked it as all the sides are made from glass and to the untrained eye look as if you could fall out. (they should look to covering the windows as it makes the whole thing very scary).If they covered the windows and had maybe a hotdog seller inside I would ride again.No way I'm pay to feel like I could die any second. No way.,ITS A TRAP!
"October 7, 2014","The words of the famous admiral best captures this ""attraction"". During my trip, we had the good foresight to get the fast track tickets so we did not have to stand and wait in an agonizingly long line. But even that failed to save this ""attraction"".Once you board, you go up on a very slow ferris wheel. Then you go down. And that's pretty much it. At the top you get a mediocre view of London and the Thames. But since you're in a giant slow moving Ferris Wheel, there's no opportunity to escape even if you wanted to. And boy, if I could, I would've definitely chosen to escape because it was not worth a fraction of the cost paid.",Have been charged twice. Can not get my money back. BEWARE!!!

The champagne experience was just what we needed smaller group of people, little glass of champagne and a lovely guide more than happy to take the perfect picture of you with an incredible back drop! 😀 loved every second of the 30 minute journey would highly recommend X",Splurge for Flexi Fast-Track
"January 23, 2020","For the 360 degree, high-above-London view, I recommend everyone ride this at least once.  We pre-bought the Fast Track ticket before we knew that it would be raining at our chosen time, so the weather hindered our view slightly.  However, even in the rain, there's something peaceful about being that high above millions of people in your little bubble.  I can imagine it wouldn't be so peaceful if your pod companions are chatty and loud, but we had a quiet, reverential group.  Still, I recommend trying to ride on a clear day, for how much further you would be able to see under better conditions.  Spring for the Flexi Fast-Track ticket, which lets you ride at whatever time you wish on your chosen day.  This won't help you so much if it's raining from sun up to sun down, but should there be a break in the clouds, you can head pop on over at any time.  But keep in mind that this is an online exclusive on the London Eye website, so don't show up and expect to be able to buy these flexible tickets at the gate.  Also available for purchase online (I'm not sure if you can buy these at the counter too) -- mini binoculars, which you can then keep as a souvenir!",A Must do While in London!
"January 14, 2020","Terrific views of London, worth the price and the wait.  I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting London.",Requested from granddaughter
"January 7, 2020","My wife and I took our 16 year old granddaughter to London.  While there, we took her on the combination river cruise and London Eye.  It was something that would not have made the ""to do"" list absent a request from our granddaughter.  I was concerned that the tours would present opportunities to stand in long lines to do activities with little payoff.  We enjoyed the river tour and found the guide to be energetic and entertaining.  The Eye does provide quite a view, even on a rainy day.  The lines at both events were well managed and efficient.",Excellent venue
"December 29, 2019",We opted to pay the extra £10 for the express access to avoid the very long queue for the standard admission price. Well worth it! We got on almost immediately.,Amazing London View
"December 17, 2019","It was our first time to visit London, so decided to try this London Eye ride. Since we had a limited time in London and it was on Sunday, decided to purchase the fast track pass. There were a long line for the regular line, but we didn’t have to wait and got in London Eye! We got to enjoy 360 degree London View. The whole ride was about 30 minutes. Really enjoyed the experience!",great view 
"December 16, 2019",I was surprised by the size of the london eye  it was very big which told me that there would be an amazing view as i went on i noticed there was a huge amount of space. it was the weekend and even with all the people there was still a lot of space for every one to move around. in my opinion I would say it’s great for explorers and social media influencers,"Awesome, must do"
"December 13, 2019","We were unsure as it wasn't cheap and seemed a bit touristy, but absolutely worth it! Such an amazing view of all of London, and night or day are both amazing. We have friends who said night was incredible all lit up; we did the daytime and it was beautiful and cool seeing everything from a different perspective. ",Beautiful
"December 13, 2019",We visited the London Eye last year during the day. This time we visited at 4pm at it was maigcal.ondin was all lit up and beautiful. You could see all the christmas markets and lights. Truly magical! Well worth a visit. The queues were not to bad and staff friendly. ,Wow... and I don’t like heights! 
"December 8, 2019","Were there queue’s yes - even with a wheelchair but everyone was in good spirits, the staff efficient, helpful and friendly. Honestly I was going because it was something my partner dearly wanted to do, turns out, I enjoyed it more than him! Fantastic views and I never had a single moment of fear re heights, it moves so slowly it’s hardly noticeable and is so stable you don’t get that feeling of “it’s going to collapse any minute”! I say feel the fear and do it anyway - it is soooo worth it. ",Great views 
"February 26, 2020",About 30 minute wait— it is February.  I suspect it’s longer in the summer months.  Great views of London.  Lots of options in the area.  ,A must-do even if you don’t like heights
"February 26, 2020",What’s great way to take a break from walking around London and take in the view! I have to admit I don’t enjoy heights but being inside a large capsule like this wasn’t bad at all. It moves very slowly and you have lots of time to take great photos. I am glad we decided to give this a try.,Worth the experience
"February 21, 2020","My husband, Aunt and I took my 10 year old son on the London Eye today. He has special needs and came home from school with a 50% off voucher. We booked 2 adult tickets and 1 Child. As our son receives DLA we knew we would be entitled to a free Carer ticket (to be purchased on the day.) At 50% off it seemed a great deal.The process was fairly painless. We purchased our carer ticket from kiosk 1&2 (showing appropriate evidence) and were given Fast Track access for us all. There was a queue as you would expect but it moved smoothly and we went through security painlessly. The flight was good fun. Be aware that the bubbles don’t stop for boarding so be prepared to be hussled on like in a ski lift! The views were fantastic and our son thoroughly enjoyed spotting trains and boats from the air whilst we scoured the skyline for the sights.I’m not sure we would pay full price for fast track tickets given the option so we were glad of the free upgrade. Our son wears a sunflower lanyard signifying hidden disabilities and feel that was a good visual marker for security etc.Lovely day out.",A must do
"February 21, 2020","A must do when in London. On our half term family trip we had a lovely afternoon ride around the London Eye. You get great views north and south, sometimes people are a little nervous or a little reluctant to move around. Some focus on the Houses of Parliament. But without moving around you don’t get a good view of the city, the shard, buck house, St James’ park, the south bank, etc.You also get a 4d ride in county hall behind which is a nice few minutes fun too. Fast track means you queue less but the capacity of the eye is quite high so the standard queue turns over quite quick. If you’ve got the money do the vip and have the space to enjoy and move around freely.",London Eye
"February 11, 2020","It cost £29 but a great view of the city. Its brilliant it lasts about a half a hour, but I thought its very expensive. £58 for two us","Splendid views, photo souvenir is worthwhile"
"February 10, 2020","On January 2020 a sunny morning, we go for London Eye.  At the entrance, a photo stand was prepared for tourists as souvenirs.  The views was so fantastic and you could see all the famous spots in one go.   Afterwards, we go downstairs to see the beautiful photos we have taken before enter the London Eye.  It is worthwhile to buy the souvenirs (included website to download photos) especially when you would like to take pictures with 4 members together.   A delighted experience.",Beautiful
"February 10, 2020",One of the best thing to do in london. Dont escape from this definetly try if you are not afraid of high.,Super viewers
"February 10, 2020",Well worth the money.. wonderful experience.. had a fantastic time.. à must do while in London.. unbeatable views 👍👍👍👍,Beautiful
"February 10, 2020",Definitely it is one of the place you should visit when you go at London. Amazing view i was with my girlfriend and we take the best photos there,10/10
"February 9, 2020","Approx 30 minutes in the pods. Queuing system was simple, yet effective. Pods were very clean and safety checked after each ride. Staff were very organised and pleasant.",Fun
"November 17, 2019","First time riders and in London so we weren't sure what ticket to purchase was we head there could be pretty long waits if you go at the wrong time. Luckily we walked over, purchased our tickets online 45 min prior and walked straight on. No wait, no fast pass ticket. Standard ticket saved ourselves a few pounds 👌🏽overall definitely worth the ride. Beautiful scenery at night with London lit up!",Beautiful Sunset
"October 31, 2019",As a Londoner I finally bit the Bullet and took my 8 Year old Daughter on the Eye. Although it was ridiculously expensive (£82 For Fast track for two) I think the experience was worth it. Went around Sunset and was rewarded with stunning Winter Sunset over the Capitol! Priceless I guess.,Awesome views must do
"October 27, 2019","Do this. Make sure you pre book. Fast track. Pay the extra well worth it. Get in early. We went on a Sunday around 10:20am little line. Great day for us could see all over London. Staff supper friendly and helpful, even security are nice, say hello to them. Yes it's touristy but what a view. ",Great view over London
"October 18, 2019","It is a really impressive construction and you get a nice view over entire London.It can be a little bit pricey and I suggest you to buy the tickets in advance. If you buy them in advance (online) you can pick your tickets up in ‘the office’ near to the Eye.It is a good experience, but it isn’t my favourite attraction and the minus for me is that you have to pick (for standard ticket) 15min slot and also everything extra is really more expensive (fast line for example - around 10£ more).",Pretty 
"October 14, 2019",This was really cool to see. Didn't go on it because it was a little too expensive. But it was pretty to see from boat tour. ,Disappointed
"October 11, 2019","We used National Rail’s offer of 2 for 1 to buy tickets for the Eye. I’m so pleased we did because for 3 of us, the tickets only came out at just under £20 each rather than the full £30 and it wasn’t really worth even the £20. On board the ride, you get brilliant views over the London sky-line but there is no information as to what you are looking at. I’m told there used to be commentary pointing out features but that doesn’t seem to be available anymore. Neither is there a map with places of interest pointed out or even a compass point. ",Worth the visit and great price
"October 9, 2019","We ended up buying the ticket at the pier since we didnt want to chance of being late or constricted. We waited in line for about 15 min, bought the tickets for both the boat and the london eye and eight away went into the line. The line was about 40 min wait but it was moving and the time went by quick. The ride was nice and we didnt have too many people on the london eye booth so we were able to take pictures without anyone pushing. The boat ride was great. It was a little chilly but you get to see the london from the boat and the guide was quite funny. Glad we did it and the price is great. So if you sidnt want to book it ahead of time you can just buy the package for the same price by the pier and not have to worry about being late for your time.",London eye
"October 8, 2019",Very nice experience but really expensive and crowded during the summer. For 15 minutes is too much struggle.,London eye
"October 5, 2019",Great place to walk around and to try the London eye ..fantastic feeling and view ...it cost 30pound by person.   And the photo cost 20 pound !!!!??? ,Great experience
"October 1, 2019",One for the bucket list. Great experience. If I had one thing that may enhance it? A commentary that points out some of the buildings we were looking at . Would have just put the cherry on it as we spent a lot of time guessing .,Ridiculously overpriced and horribly long waiting time
"July 14, 2019","To put it in a nutshell, yes the views are nice but watch out for the cons:Waiting in line for 20 minutes to buy a ticket for GBP 30 (regular price unless you buy a discounted ticket)... get assigned a time slot when you are allowed to enter the actual queue (ours was one hour after purchase of tickets)... wait in another line for 40 minutes for your twenty minute ride... standing in an overcrowded capsule that is... been there, done that but won’t do it again...",It goes around and you see London
"July 12, 2019","BOught ticket at on the day of the ride, yeah could have prepared and saved 10% but was last minute decisions. Go the standard ticket, fast pass really didn't have much of a difference, check the line first thought. we went around, saw things, got a photo when ""coming into land"" and that was it ",ok to go
"July 12, 2019","i didnt go on the wheel as i just took some picture from the outsidethe ticket is pretty expensive and i dont think is worth to go on as there are so many people in one cart. however if yo really like wheels, i guess you could give it a try with the long line up",Awesome! A must do!
"July 12, 2019","Bought skip-the-line passes and went straight on through. Great experience, amazing views of the city in all directions! Doesn’t feel too high if you not afraid of heights. Not your typical Ferris wheel, the carriages are quite large.",River trip
"July 11, 2019",The ticket we bought through trip advisor was not valid when we turned up at the pier to catch the boat. We were turned away and told the ticket was incorrect. Very disappointed at wasting an afternoon of our London as we only had 4 days in London 😤😤,Fast Track !!!!
"July 10, 2019","Quite a queue, was the extra amount paid worth it, NO.I must admit there was a long line in the normal queue, but still had to wait quite a while to get through.I don’t think the extra price was worth it.",Great view of London but skip the queue
"July 6, 2019","The queues are VERY long most days - especially on weekends, peak season and 11am - 3pm. Be prepared to stand for at least 30 -45 minutes even if you have a pre booked ticket with a time slot. I can highly suggest upgrading to a Fast Track Ticket - the ticket office is opposite the wheel. The extra money was totally worth it! We bypassed loads of people standing in the queue and got into a cabin within 5 minutes My sons age 11 and 13 really enjoyed the view from the London Eye! The cabins are big so fit lots of people but they don’t overcrowd them. ",Used ‘Mates go free’ from Kellogg’s cereal packs
"July 6, 2019",Went there on a Thursday morning. Had booked tickets for later in the day after reading about the queues but were walking past and there was practically no queue. Managed to use our ticket to walk straight on (the nice guide said that we wouldn’t be able to do this if it was really busy). 30 minute ride with great views on a glorious day. 2 of our party were nervous of heights. They mostly sat on the bench in the middle and ‘enjoyed’ the views from there. Great opportunity for photos.,Not worth it.
"July 5, 2019",In my opinion the price is not worth the attraction. Better to go to sky garden to see the skyline of London.,No other way to do it!
"July 4, 2019",We went to the champagne experience for the London eye (with the optional sky lounge option) and I wouldn’t do it any other way!  We got to sit and enjoy a glass of champagne while watching everyone lined up for hours outside!  And then we had another glass while on the Eye!  The host was fun and charming and gave us great ideas for when and where to get the snapshots!  ,Giving London The Eye
"December 14, 2018",Luckily had the fast-track ticket - as queues may be daunting.  Loved the view and the refreshments.  The ride is over real quickly - so don't spend it on your phone taking pictures!  Rather enjoy the view and ask the two ladies accompanying - to take a photo or two for you!,Be Fast on the Fast Track Line
"December 5, 2018","On our ride to London from Southampton, our driver Mark suggested taking in the London Eye experience and suggested getting fast track tickets, which can include the Big Bus ( a hop on/hop off bus) and a boat ride up the Thames to Greenwich.  We jumped on a Big Bus only to find out we needed to buy our ticket at the London.  The operators were kind enough to allow us to ride until we reached the London Eye.  a bit confusing figuring out where to buy the Fast track tix.  Long lines to convert  Ticket purchased on line .. had to be scanned in for a London Eye and Big Bus Tix. Tourist were very nice or very naive in allowing me to cut the line to get info and return once tickets were purchased.  I'm certain had my New York State of Being not kicked in, we would have waited in even the Fast Track ticket lines.",Worth a visit 
"October 30, 2018","We visited on the 29th October and after some confusion over which queue to join as we are Merlin pass holders, and as you approach they had 3 Queues in operation. This is a must use attraction very worthwhile and the views are amazing.. Definitely will visit again..",Marvel at this landmark
"October 23, 2018",Looks beautiful day or night. Expect to queue to get on. Goes around slowly. Not cheap!.... Shared capsule with others. Engineering triumph..... You cannot miss it if in Central London. I use this to get my bearing around London,"good fun, value for money"
"October 19, 2018","Booked online and chose the times we wanted to go on the cruise and the London Eye meaning we didn't have to queue. The weather wasn't great for the cruise but the crew made sure the seats were dry on the upper deck and that we were comfortable. There are refreshments and toilets on board. Jennifer the tour guide knew her stuff and was really cheerful and funny which brightened up the dull day. Well worth the money, only wish the sun had come out! ",London Eye fast track
"October 14, 2018","We bought the fast track tickets for an extra 10 pounds per person. The fast track ONLY fast tracks you from the outside line. Once you head into the shelter of entering the Eye you are with everyone. The Eye itself is good. Great views, car is not too full - so you can walk around, it is very slow moving so no motion sickness.","Nice view,,But boring.."
"September 13, 2018","Well it does what it says it does.TIP get 2 for 1 via C2C national rail website, pop in the code on the eye website and you get 1 person FREE, so 2 people for £27, que moved fast enough had pre-booked online tickets so go straight to the line to get on it,, share the pod with about 10 others, plenty of room and AC was on too.View is good (on a clear sunny day of course), but after about 5/10 minutes its pretty boring, 30mins in and your out again.Could be better at night, maybe Christmas time will be more dramatic, to be honest its pretty dull and not something people rave about after, but i suppose you have to try it.",Fasttrack to wonderful views
"August 28, 2018","Yes, it comes at a price. Yet, it is worth it when you have limited time in London. A bit confusing at first, where to queue up. Fairly easy in the end and quick to get on the ride.  ",Thames Riverside
"August 19, 2018","We didn't get to go up in the ""eye"" due to the lines of people waiting and us having younger kids with us.  I can only imagine the elevated views must be fantastic !!",London Eye VIP Champagne
"August 13, 2018","What a lasting memory!!! We chose the V.I.P experience around 7 in the evening. Clear skies, champagne & speedy boarding. But truth be told- our host Rhona made the experience. Cheers Rhona, you’re top notch! Make sure to request her the next time you visit London!",You can see it all
"August 8, 2018",The London eye was really tall so you could see for miles.  You could move around and take photos without the basket tipping and you felt completely safe.  Being in the capsule you felt safe and yet looking at it from the ground it looks so high I cannot believe it went so high.  I really recommend the Skip-the-Line.,See London Through the Eye
"October 14, 2018",Serene view of London and a great way to orient someone to The sights of Westminster and the City. Great way to watch the sun go down and the city begin to light up for evening. ,A little underwhelming 
"October 9, 2018","Visited the eye in the evening thinking the crowds would be less.  We had vouchers and had to stand in very long line to get them redeemed, then another line to get on the eye.  The lines did move quickly.  You are packed into a car with about 25 people and the eye does a slow rotation so you can have views of the city.  Nice but probably not worth the money or time.",Tourist trap. 
"September 30, 2018","Yes, it's cool. Yes, it has a good view. But yes, it's damned expensive for what you get out of it. Even more so if you try the expresse route. And the wait is terrible especially if you go in the summer I assume. London has some great alternatives if all you are looking for is a good view of the city. So if I were you, unless you must have this London experience, save yourself some coppers and I suggest you research some other place to see the vistas. ",Very expensive
"September 18, 2018",Very expensive but worth the experience and seeing the views of the city from so high in the air. Long lines but they move pretty fast.,London Must See
"August 6, 2018",I recommend buying a Skip the Line Ticket. It saves so much time and line standing. The view is tremendous - an excellent and unforgettable way to spend a few hours. Be sure and try to find a day with some sunshine. The picture taking is great. It goes so slowly that pictures come out great! I highly recommend this adventure. For all ages.,London Eye

"April 1, 2023","Pleased I've done it but far too expensive for basically just an half hour ride, the views are good  but lacks the wow factor compared to the shard, nowhere covered to wait especially when it's cold and wet, but happy to take £33 a person off you.  Not an experience I'd bother repeating",Special trip
"March 30, 2023",The trip totally exceeded my expectations. The sights were amazing but what made it special was the commentary from Jordan. Informative but also very amusing. What was not great was the gentleman spreading his wife's ashes from London Bridge as we passed underneath.,Birthday Surprise. wonderful experience
"March 30, 2023",What a fabulous day. Dennis from Iconic  whom we met in the gift shop was a wonderful kind man. As it was a birthday present he went out of his way to make sure we were looked after and spoilt. Well done to him and the rest of the staff for making this trip so memorable. Thank you,Go early in the morning to beat the crowds
"March 30, 2023",A wonderful way to take London in and appreciate the views of all of London's spectacular sites. The staff is friendly and we felt very safe the whole time.  The ticket booth is across the path from the eye so don't stand in line until you have your ticket.,I love it

"March 29, 2023","What a lovely experience! I went with my family. We are platinum members for Merlin passes, so we only paid £7.0 per person. It was comfortable and clean.

"March 29, 2023","The London Eye offers a breathtaking view of the city and is definitely worth a visit. The ride is smooth and comfortable, and the staff is friendly and helpful.

"April 10, 2018",‪Absolutely shocked and appalled that we were able to purchase tickets on the merlin webpage for my family with young children when the attraction was closed and have been denied a refund request. What a con and scam. We will never purchase tickets for any merlin managed attraction again  ‬,So much fun 
"April 7, 2018","We went on a day with relatively good weather. There are panoramic views of the city, it’s on the Thames, and it’s close to Parliament and Big Ben. Definitely get the Fast Track pass and arrive within a couple of hours of opening if you can. You can buy advance tickets at tourist information center if you like (we did this). But you still have to exchange those for a timed ticket when you arrive and it looked to me like those lines could get long. If you have time flexibility, it doesn’t matter so much. ",Purchased a Priority Combi for Madame Tussauds Priority Entry & London Eye Fast Track Tickets
"April 1, 2018","Bought the Priority Combi tickets for both Madame Tussauds and London Eye which entitled us for Fast Track Entry but the Guide at London Eye told us we got the normal tickets as the Fast Track wording were not printed on the tickets, what's the point paying £59 when I could get a normal ticket for both attractions at £40, I'm not trying to claim for the refund of £19 but just not satisfied with the reasons that were given to us even we highlighted to a few Guides at London Eye. The experience at the Eye was absolutely amazing, just disappointed with the normal ticket queue instead of being given fast track entry which I've paid for.",London WOW!
"March 27, 2018","First time on the London Eye and it was a thrilling experience. I have a fear of heights,so I was extremely nervous, but I loved every minute of it.

"March 26, 2018","Enjoyed this trip, second time on it. Would definitely recommend paying the extra for the fast track ticket. Great views of London. My only two negatives are 1) price of the souvenir photo is extortion, if it was a reason or slightly overpriced item we probably would have bought it but was a complete rip off. 2) 2-4 less people per pod would make it more enjoyable. In saying all this, definitely worth a visit. ",Great views and a warm ride on a snowy day
"March 5, 2018","This was a nice warm retreat from some very unusual snow across London, the treat is though the views wher spectacular and probably some that many rarely see. As all the roofs and building, lawns and garden where blanketed in white. It was truly a fairy winter wonderland, even though it was the first day of Spring. I can imagine no matter what the weather the view would always be great so this is well worth the cost and time. ",All was quick and smooth
"February 20, 2018","Had a lovely time in the pod at sunset.

"January 27, 2018","Info: Sat inside the wheel on a sunny spring day with clear blue sky’s over London. Pros: - air conditioned cabins - enough space to move around inside without feeling restricted by other guests - the view is amazing, you can see as far as your eye can see. - queuing  lines weren’t that long when I went (but I can assume it would get pretty long.)- photo opportunity - roughly 45mins/1 hour ride.- good location easily accessible and it’s in close proximity to other site seeing locations. - wheelchair friendly. - reasonable entry fee. - kids/family will love it. Cons: - if you have a fear of heights, close your eyes. - sharing cabin with strangers (they could be annoying) - long queuing lines on popular days. Summary, Highly recommended activity for tourists visiting the area. Enjoy. ",Worth it!
"December 31, 2017","Booked ticket that skipped the Queue!  Was worth it as it was a cold crisp day.  Shame that Big Ben was undergoing works but still worth the visit to see the rest of London.  It’s not cheap but hey, it’s London and it’s a once in a life time experience.Would recommend to them to lower price of photos-25 quid is expensive- increase your sales but lowering price.

We decided to do one of the VIP experiences with Champagne. I can highly recommend doing the London eye this way if it is in your budget. This meant that we didnt have to queue to buy our tickets and could escape the crowds to the eye lounge, where we recieved a complimentary drink. We were then guided down to the eye and straight into a pod without having to stand in further queues. We then took in the sights with a glass of Champagne. You really do feel like a VIP.",Great views 
"July 1, 2018","Lovely views over London, very very hot in the pods though. Queues were very long due to high season demands but the queues were managed well to ensure they kept moving. Was able to use my tesco vouchers so the overall cost for the 3 of us was half the original cost from £81 to £40.50. ",Great view
"June 23, 2018","Whilst visiting London with my wife, we decided the best way to take in London was to do the London eye. I’m in London frequently with work but haven’t done the ‘tourist bit’ for a few years. It was great! Queues were large but moved quickly - prob 15 minutes! Great views of a great city! ",A Must For First Time Visitors
"June 23, 2018",A great way to see the city with an amazing view.  For our trip around The Eye we bought our tickets in advance online and went with the skip the line option which was worth it as there was no wait for us.The pods are huge and it was only us and another group of four people in a pod that I imagine could accommodate at least twice as many people.  So lots of room to move and find the right spot for pictures.  A trip around takes about 30 minutes so it won’t eat up all that much of your day.   ,Great First introduction
"June 23, 2018","We purchased our London eye + river cruise tickets in advance which I would recommend so you don’t have to line up twice. It was our first day in London so we decided to do a cruise. The river cruise was very informative and our tour guide was full of funny facts. We got to see all of the main sights along the Thames so it was a great way to get our bearings. We then lined up for the London eye, don’t be discouraged as the line goes quickly. We got a great view of London/ the Thames and I would definitely do it again! ",Great view!
"November 30, 2017","Being overcast day was ideal! No sun glare, no crowds! Takes 30 minutes for one revolution which is plenty of time to wander around the compartment to see views in every direction.","Pricy, but nice view"
"September 9, 2017",Nice way to see the city. 95GBP for a family standard rate. 15 min line and 15 min ride. View is unbeatable. Pricy but ok.,Tourists attraction -expensive
"August 28, 2017","Did the London Eye, do the fast track if you can, buy ticket in advance and go later during almost end of day.. line ups definitely shorter. Very expensive but considering most museums are free ( donation ) . I guess they have to make money somewhere... ",Overrated
"August 24, 2017","London eye is totally overrated , I booked tickets online for 4 pm as I had tickets for a musical at 8. Got there at 3:45 to be told that I have to line up or I can buy fast track tickets for 10 pound per person. And that the time on ticket, 4 pm, gives me the right stand in line at 4 pm. I paid 40 pounds extra, just to stand in the fast track line. It is not worth the money.",Great views but a bit expensive with poorly organised queuing system 
"August 14, 2017","Cost £40 + £10 in clubcard vouchers. Views were good and the children enjoyed it. Despite booking a time, we didn't get on until 30 minutes after our scheduled time. We were made to queue just by the entrance to the pods for nearly 20 minutes due to another customer arguging with a member of staff. Due to the poor organisation this meant that people in the other queue wo had arrived some time after this git on before us. There was no communication from the staff and no apology for the delay. ",Awesome experience on the London Eye River Cruise
"July 16, 2017","Had a lovely afternoon in London on both the London Eye, followed by the London Eye River Cruise. Every employee I encountered was friendly, helpful and happy. There was a really lovely atmosphere and the process of boarding both the London Eye and River Cruise was incredibly easy. Top marks to the guy we met on the London Eye Pier who helpfully directed us to our cruise which we boarded at 17.45 today (16/07/17). We had some brilliant commentary on board our cruise expertly and enthusiastically delivered by Ruby. Ruby made the experience my wife and I had on the boat really good, particularly her encouragement for us to wave at the bridges 😄😄😄Well done to everyone at the both the London Eye and Rivercruise, I would recommend doing both if you can. ",BEST VIEW OF LONDON
"June 1, 2017","Without question, London's best view and a unique travel experience........ferris wheel rotation lasts 30 minutes......easy access and lots of souvenir shops.......hours from 11an to 6pm",Rip off
"April 19, 2017",Don't bother with this- it's expensive and really nothing to brag about.  The view was horrendous- like watching construction crains - really waste of time and money.,Amazing😮
"April 19, 2017",Really good view a tiny bit slow but really good there are quite a lot of people and restaurant that have amazing😍food and drinks🍻🍷🍹🍸🍺,Great veiws
"April 9, 2017","Line was super long but went pretty quick.... we coupled this with the boat tour purchased through the website and it was a nice experience.  Definitely buy your tickets ahead of time, it will save you a lot of time.",Converted!
"January 9, 2017","I was very sceptical about going on the London Eye as I thought it was too expensive and a waste of time, however I got 2 for 1 tickets from National Rail by using my train tickets to London and it was great. It is very clean (cleaners come on after every rotation to clean the pod in seconds) and very interesting. The touchscreens are great so you can see what particular buildings are (or to look for any that are not obvious straight away). We only queued for about 10 minutes as they get people on and off the pods quite quickly. Loved it, one of the highlights of the trip!",Book in advance and check the weather! Avoid champagne experience
"January 2, 2017",A great experience as we expected but the weather changed and it got very wet and foggy so we were restricted. Definitely pay for the fast track even though you end up queueing here also. Do not bother with the champagne experience the lounge is dirty and cold with booming music - the steps up were sticky from not being cleaned. You will get wet queueing if the weather is bad so definitely wrap up. Staff there seem not to care almost numb - their pay must be low. It gets very busy around the London eye so expect people everywhere. We were hungry before we went up so we found a subway around the corner for a cheap sandwich - directly on the street behind the eye,Not to bad
"October 12, 2016",Go on a clear day... and avoid school holiday the ques can be quite large prebook you tickets online if you can,Great views of Big Ben
"September 28, 2016","The views from the top are awesome! Especially the houses of the parliament! I prefer it at night time, but it's also gorgeous on a sunny day. Must try! ",Great experience
"September 19, 2016",We were lucky we had a lovely sunny day. Definitely an experience not to miss.  The views were amazing.,Meh
"September 3, 2016","Overpriced and overcrowded - supposedly the pods hold 25 people,  but in ours there were no less than 30,  with many (screaming) kids. ",Queues ridiculous and allocated time meaningless
"August 12, 2016","I had planned to take a friend on the Eye who had never visited the capital before, as a treat. I booked and paid for the tickets 2 weeks in advance for a 3pm 'flight' When we arrived, we queued for 50mins just to collect the tickets and were then told that there was at least another 45 mins in a second queue to actually get on The Eye due to 'lots of school parties'. That would mean our 3pm tickets would actually be for nearer 5pm, the time we had booked and paid to have dinner. We were told casually that we could use the tickets any time up until 9pm as if it was ok to hang around for 6 hours for something we had booked for a specific time. I was told that tickets were non refundable and that was a blanket policy. Well, sorry, but you broke the contract to provide a service and, in law, that means you have to provide a refund regardless of whatever policies you wish to try to impose. A thoroughly shameless and illegal practice engaged by a company that ought to know better. Fortunately, I got a full refund from my credit card company despite you trying to defend your indefensible and shoddy practices.It's a shame because the London Eye used to be good until this lot started to run the show and became so draconian.","Brilliant, what an experience"
"August 10, 2016",Pre book your tickets to avoid the queues. What an experience this is! Spectacular views and very much worth doing. ,Long queues - even though pre booked
"August 10, 2016",Really disappointed with this experience. We pre booked tickets (which are not cheap) and arrived in plenty of time. Joined queue and stood for 50 minutes in hot weather before getting onto pod. I felt really sorry for people with young kids. AV TVs did not work and the staff we encountered were rude and dismissive. Lovely view of London of course but would advise visitors just to pop into the Tate Modern for free viewing in much more pleasant surroundings. Save your money folks - the eye is a rip off in our experience. Pity. ,Great views but long queues 
"August 6, 2016","Had a great time on the London eye with great views, it was a shame the queues were so long, had to wait over and hour to get on the attraction. ",A must do!!
"November 18, 2015","If you go to London you have to go on the eye. I was a little apprehensive as i am not good with heights, however, I am so glad i did.It is worth the money for the sights.I went on just as it started to get dark, by the time we got to the top it was dark and the whole of London was lit up. An amazing sight.And to make it even better there was the 4d experience built into the price, which we visited afterwards. Its only about 5 minutes long but really ended a fantastic experience.","Try it at dawn, day, dusk and night for a different experience"
"November 8, 2015","Been on it a few times now, at various times of the day, and each time it is great and suprising. It is always nicer to to on with friends, new to London, and point out landmarks.",Amazing
"November 1, 2015","This attraction in london is in my top 3Its amazing, yes there are long queues and the wait is long but believe me its worth itThe views at the top are fantastic, the staff were very helpful and always smileyJust a shame it closes on 31st Oct as would love to see the Christmas Lights of London from the top and maybe next time ill hire a capsule with champagne :)",Absolutely awfyl
"October 19, 2015","We paid for the tickets and then we weren't allowed in.  Absolutely terrible will never come back, totally outrageous confiscation of merlin passes 😡😡😡😡",Fun but expensive.
"October 14, 2015","I really like the London eye. If your in London for a short time it's a must do, the view or the Houses of Parliament & Big Ben are great. But be warned it isn't cheap! They try to make it seem value for money by showing a 4D film before you going the line. It's probably good for small kids but I got a little bored and impatient just wanting to get on the eye. All in all you have to do it even tho it's expensive. But so are most tourist things and they all have their own draw.",On Top Of The London Eye!
"October 11, 2015","Once you’ve enjoyed London from the ground level, it’s a great idea to head upwards and look down on the city’s many famous buildings and attractions. The views are truly panoramic. I can’t help but admire the beautiful buildings and bridges. Was it worth the ride? Yes it was!",champagne run
"October 6, 2015",this was our second visit to the London Eye and both time we did the champagne run which is more expensive but less crowded and has a shorter queue. It was a beautiful day so we had great views,Great way to get an overall birds eye view perspective of London
"October 4, 2015",Visited with UK relatives who had little experience of London. This was the first thing we did to give them an overall perspective of the city and the main downtown geography. A must see for first time visitors. Booked tickets online the night before and required only a 5min queue to pick up an hardly any wait for the ride.,Great way to see London
"October 1, 2015",The Eye is in a great location which allowed us a birds eye view of some of the great sites in London.,a lovely moment with a beautiful night city view
"September 9, 2015","We enjoyed the night view of London, especially the lighting up Big Ben was very beautiful.  We recommend purchasing the fast pass ticket in advance especially if you visit London during peak season because there was a long line even at around 8PM, which is when we went.",Amazing
"September 8, 2015","Get on the London Eye to get a 360 degree birds eye view of the city of London. Sit in the glass capsules as you see the Thames bending for miles and capturing the other attractions of the city like Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Tower Bridge, Gherkin Building et.al. Queues can be long during weekends. You can book your tickets online and be in the pick up queue which is relatively smaller and faster than the queue for buying tickets. You can also get into the Fastrack queue which will save you a lot of time including avoiding the long queue of embarking, but that comes at almost double the price of normal tickets",One of our favorites
"August 28, 2015","Beautiful views, smooth ride even for those with fear of heights,  expensive but worth the money.  Get the fast pass!",Fun thing to do with family and friends 
"August 15, 2015","The lines are huge, even though you have a ticket for a certain time. We made the mistake of waiting to go on our last day, which was Saturday, and we showed up with vouchers at 6pm. The first tickets were available for 8:30pm. We couldn't line up before 8:00pm, and even then we probably waited for 45 minutes. Inside the capsule, you have nice views, but it's basically 40 minutes of people taking selfies! I'm glad we did it, but at the same too, I'm not sure if I'd do again if i came back to London. ",Fantastic view
"August 15, 2015","We ride this every time we visit London and are always amazed with the view and how many people ride this every day.This is right across from Big Ben and Parliament so the view is truly one of a kind. I would recommend getting your ticket ahead of time via the internet. First of all it is less expensive. Second you can avoid the line to buy tickets. The nearest station is either Westminster or Waterloo. I like the former because of the view along the river. I would also recommend getting the daytime/night time ticket. we rode it at 10 AM and then you can ride it again anytime after 5 PM. We went back around 9 PM and the lights of London just reemphasize what a beautiful city it is. Also when you get into the pod, I would avoid sitting. Everyone heads for the benches but really you are not there to sit. Head to the end of the pod facing the left side. That way you can guarantee the best view during the 30 minute ride. ",Champagne Experience on the Eye
"August 14, 2015","Advice: book the ""Champagne Experience"" for the London Eye and have a way, way better experience than those who are waiting in that interminable line with their standard tickets.  If you book online in advance it's £28.80.  The extra eight pounds are absolutely worth it.  The area around the Eye is a tad sketchy and super touristy, as is to be expected.  When we approached, I saw the world's longest line stretching out from the Eye and felt a little glum... but my friend had booked Champagne Experience tickets, so we strolled right past that horrible line and picked up tickets at a nearby building.  Then, we were pointed to a lounge on the second floor, where we waited around a little bit (but on comfortable sofas with views of the Eye, so much better than that line outside), and were then taken directly to the Eye by a private guide with the other parties who'd booked our time slot.  We went through security quickly, where our bags were checked, and then straight onto the Eye with no waiting.  There were about 12 of us total in the group, which was a perfect size.  We had plenty of room to move about the car and not feel crowded.  Our guide poured a glass of Champagne for each of us, handed out maps of what we'd see on our ride, and then gave some description of what we were seeing and engaged us in a quick trivia contest that got everyone laughing.  Everyone was enjoying themselves.  The views from the Eye are spectacular.   My only complaint is that I'd have liked to go around again, it was so breathtaking.  We were there towards the end of the day, on a gorgeous, clear day, and the views of London were absolutely incredible.  I'm afraid of heights, but had no trouble with the Eye.  It moves slowly and the cars are very sturdy, so you don't feel the up & down movement.  If you're going to do the Eye, I recommend bypassing those crowds so you can really enjoy the experience.  Upgrade that ticket!  This is one of those places it's worth it to spend a bit more, if you can.",Amazing view!!
"August 12, 2015","It's a fun attraction in london. There is a beautiful view of the city you can see the big ben, the castles and a pretty part of the london.I recommend!!!! Go guys!!!",Good views
"August 8, 2015","One of the most popular places in London, this place attracts loads of tourists as there is lots more to do than just taking a ride on the big wheel. The views are good from top both on good clear day or night, but there is actually much more happening in and around the eye on the quay side. just spare enough time if you plan to take a ride on this as there is a long q's....",Iconic
"July 31, 2015","This was the first thing we did when we arrived in London. I already bought tickets online prior to arriving to London. We got our Fast Track tickets which were amazing. We saw the queue to buy tickets and we are glad that bought out tickets online. We got there a bit early and the ticket we bought was for 5:00pm but they allowed us to go up around 4:30pm. We met up with out relatives who got normal tickets online, but they were allowed to upgrade their tickets to Fast track tickets. The queue for the normal ticket is different from the fast track tickets. The fast track ticket queue was empty. The capsule was big enough for a few people. You have to sort of squeeze yourself at times to see the view or to take photos as some people hog an area of the capsule. You just have to be polite. The views were amazing, especially because it was my first time in London. We were lucky that it was an amazing day, just a little bit of cloud in the sky. The ride felt quite quick which I'm not complaining about. It just feels so surreal to be in the London eye. The souvenir shop had a lot of good stuff. The 4D experience was pretty cool too. There were also some ice cream stands and drink stands around the area. There was also a cafeteria closeby if you get hungry and toilets of course. Simply amazing.",Excellent views of London from the London Eye
"July 27, 2015","Excellent panoramic views from the London Eye. The London cityscape is fantastic!The 30 minute revolution is about the right amount of time to enjoy the scenery and take pictures.Definitely recommend spending extra and buying the ""Fast Track"" option. My family was able to avoid the regular line-ups of +1 hour (perhaps even 2 hours?), as the timing of our visit coincided with the first Saturday after school let out in July.Sheer madness and chaos in and around the County Hall building, I think especially on the weekends. Purchase your tickets on-line in advance and save. The line-ups to retrieve your pre-purchased tickets are shorter than the line-ups to buy tickets (and no guarantee that tickets will be available).Either way, bring your patience ... and enjoy!",Fantastic experience
"July 26, 2015","We visited London last weekend and went on the eye on the Sunday. We arrived just after opening (as advised) and queued for about 20-25min. The queue moved constantly so it didn't feel like we were waiting for long.We had a BOGOF offer from national rail card, which was great, as it can get expensive if you are a family paying full price, so look out for offers.Myself and my 7 year old daughter rode the eye and we both really enjoyed the experience. We paid £1 extra for the souvenir map, which in my opinion was well worth it as, we spotted sights such as Wembley stadium, which we probably would not have noticed without the map.  It was surreal to be viewing busy noisy London in a relatively quiet and peaceful ""bubble"" and the views were amazing!!!!!Included in the ticket is a 4D show, which was a nice extra and worth doing, although I think I have been spoilt by visiting the Florida theme parksI think this is attraction is defiantly worth a visit if you are in London, it's an experience myself and my daughter certainly won't forget.",Excellent!
"March 4, 2023","Pods were less crowded than it used to be and boarding was really fast. it was my 4th visit and probably the one I enjoyed the most, Cruise was so amusing and entertaining and so funny, thanks a lot to Simon! My fiancé and I spent such a nice time with you. Kind regards",London Eye Purchase tic at kiosk and board within minutes
"March 3, 2023","London eye was excellent.  We purchased tickets 20 mins before we boarded at the kiosk below.  They book this for specific times now.  You can save some money with pre purchase, but you run the risk of missing time or waiting.  ",Not interesting as it used to be
"March 3, 2023","I had been on London Eye few times before. I was very disappointed when there was no onboard commentary.

"March 1, 2023",We really enjoyed the London Eye. The views of the city are incredible. Its very busy as is everything in London but its very well run. We had an issue with our time and had to reschedule- the staff were so accommodating and organised another day for us to use our tickets. We came back and loved it. We got the bundle deal and went to the aquarium after. Well worth getting the deal if you are a family.,Nice experience
"February 27, 2023","It’s a beautiful experience in London, specially during a sunny day without clouds or rain. The view is spectacular and worth the visit.",Lots of fun
"July 25, 2015",A great view of London- get tickets online ahead of time to avoid wait. Loved that it took some time and you could enjoy the ride and not feel rushed through the experience,Save your money
"July 23, 2015","This was one of the most anti climactic experiences I've experienced. To be honest I wasn't expecting much and it was still a disappointment. They overall hype and long lines add to the discontent. At every corner they try to squeeze some extra money from you with silly photo and other junk. Please save your money. Our two little kids would have eaten our brains if we didn't do this so we had no choice. If you have a choice, don't do it.",Amazing view!
"July 23, 2015","Since this is the second largest ferris wheel in the world, it is a must to visit of course. The wait wasn't too long (consider it was Sunday morning), the view is really amazing to see the enitre city!!",Do the Fast Track!
"July 21, 2015",Pay a little more for the Fast Track ticket. It is well worth it to skip the long line. Our wait could have been about 2 hours. It ended up being 6 minutes instead!,Avoid
"July 20, 2015",I purchase skip the line tickets. Paniced when we couldn't make our 2pm booking becos of crowds getting there onlynto find time booked means nothing.  Two hours in fast track que not my idea of fast. Too many people too few staff. .. totally shambolic.  Not worth it at all. Experience foul and ride under welling because of everything that went in to getting on. Avoid!!!,Amazing views

"July 17, 2015",It's a great way to see London's sights. The lines can be long but they moved fast when we were there. We were very happy that they didn't put too many folks on one pod and that it goes slow enough that we were able to enjoy all the sights while taking a bunch of photos. Will remember this experience for times to come.,Must-Do while in London
"July 13, 2015","I am so delighted that we chose to go on the London Eye.  The experience was wonderful.  We were able to see fabulous views over London at a measured enough pace to ensure plenty of good vacation pictures.  Having said that, shortly before returning down, you will be asked to stand where indicated and smile and can purchase a booklet about the Eye and sites visible in all direction, along with your picture before exiting the gift shop.  Your picture will also be made available on line so that you may download it into your digital albums.  Look for the line for VIP access - you will pay slightly more but it is worth the reduction in wait time.",Unbeatable London views
"July 13, 2015","We visited the London Eye first thing in the morning on Wednesday, July 1, our last day in London. I'm glad we waited until the last day, as the Eye gave us a birds-eye view of everything we saw during our trip.The total time from stepping off the tube at Westminster to completing our rotation on the Eye was about 90 minutes, which felt very reasonable. The lines were long, but moved quickly. You'll want to make sure to visit the loo before you get in line, however, as there's no opportunity until your ride is over. All of the staff we encountered were helpful and friendly, and our experience on the Eye itself was excellent. We could barely tell that we were moving, and the 360 degree map (1 pound at the ticket counter) helped us to identify all the landmarks. Note to photographers: since you're enclosed in a clear capsule, taking photos can be challenging on a sunny day due to the reflection/glare. Note to acrophobics: I'm not someone who loves heights, and I had no issues on the London Eye. It's like you're in a little room that just happens to be moving, and does not feel like a traditional ferris wheel. It feels completely stable and safe.",London Eye
"July 10, 2015","Very, very busy attraction.  Best time to go was around 6.30 pm when people were still at dinner.  Well organized, and great views of the city.  Good souvenir store at the foot of the eye.  Very smooth ride.",STUNNING VIEWS.
"May 30, 2015","If you are planning on taking a ride on The London Eye,  I suggest you pre book your time & tickets as the queue to this Ride is, in one word,  LONG.

Great to take wonderful photos of all the Landmarks.",How many of these exist?  Go for it!
"May 27, 2015","If you're in London, give it a ride.  We went about dusk and had slight rain, but still got some great photos.  We did the combo package and did the boat ride also which was very interesting.  We are glad we did the combo.",no!  Rip off!
"May 20, 2015","I would love to give this ZERO stars (er...circles).  I booked a ""flexi - fast track"" set of tickets and showed up to a line that snaked out the doors full of irate ""fast"" (or as I like to call it faster slow track) customers waiting for the pleasure of picking up said tickets.  Why you can't simply print out tickets you've already paid for is beyond me.  The line would've taken hours to just pick up paid for tickets.  Then a wait for the actual ride. Mind you this was the Fast Track!The area where it is located was full of tacky ""side show"" type entertainment.  We decide not to waste hours in line - Westminster Abbey took only 40 minutes.  AVOID THIS TACKY Attraction and shoddy customer service. I asked for my money back and they said I could come back later - if like me you have your trip planned out this was not going to happen.  In addition, I was on hold for 15 minutes calling customer service before being cut off - TWICE.  I have been to London four times and there are so many lovely things to do and places to see.  I guess there is a reason I never wasted my money there before (I'm out over $100.00). Do not waste time in this nasty area full of street hucksters.",Worth a visit

"May 17, 2015","I had bought a standard ticket on-line in advance for a ride at 10 am on a Wednesday.  I got there at 9:40 am and a short line was forming already.  The line-up is outdoors so be prepared for the weather.  There were only about a dozen people in the capsule that I had boarded.  You do get a great view during the 30-minute ride.  There are touch-screen Samsung tablets in the capsule that provide useful information on the sights that you see.  There is also a bench in the middle for sitting.Towards the end of the ride, there is a camera that automatically takes a photo of your capsule.  If you stand in the appropriate spot, the photo will include you.  You can buy this photo as part of a souvenir photobook package for £20 in the gift shop.  The photobook contains information about the Eye, a photo spread of London with the prominent sights highlighted, and two photos of you riding the capsule.  You also receive four wallet-size photos, fridge magnet, and a key ring.",Wonderful Views!
"May 9, 2015","We really enjoyed seeing the entire city this way.  Get your tickets in advance and get the fast track tickets.  We had no line and went right to the ride, amazing!",Birds eye view with a glass of bubbly well worth it!
"May 8, 2015",Waited in line to purchase a champagne package on the London Eye and River Cruise. Once we got to the front of the queue we were told to go to the VIP line off to the right as we entered to purchase the champagne ride which leaves every hour on the hour for a limited number of guests. We paid for both the champagne ride and river cruise immediately afterwards (we were cautioned we might not make it). The London eye champagne cruise was well worth the extra cost. We went upstairs to a quiet lounge and waited separately from other patrons and enjoyed a glass of champagne (at an additional cost) prior to being escorted as a separate group to the front of the line and onto our own 'private' pod. The pod was comfortable with 10 people plus our amazing tour guide Rae who served us champagne as we rode around the London Eye and was able to answer all our questions. The 360 degree view was spectacular and we were able to see all of the historically significant buildings around London. I have a long standing fear of falling and initially was rather nervous but because the rate of ascent and descent is very slow I was able to adapt and enjoy myself. I would highly recommend the champagne cruise to all adults. The River cruise was nice. The young man who did the commentary was very knowledgeable about the historical significance of the buildings on either side of the Thames. We initially sat up top but the rainy drizzle forced us inside. It was a nice ride but somewhat anticlimactic after our ride on the London Eye. I would recommend doing the river cruise first and the London Eye afterwards. Both are very worthwhile.,Fantastic. Memorable. Highly recommended.
"May 3, 2015",Can't rate the fast pass highly enough. Friendly staff. Very accommodating. Pods not packed. Fantastic experience. 10/10. Well done London eye. Tourist attraction done 100%.,A Nice View
"May 3, 2015","The London Eye was a very good experience. The line was very long but moved quickly. The views from the Eye were amazing, we got some really good pictures of Buckingham Palace and the other great sites around London. A must see when visiting London. ",Great combi ticket
"May 1, 2015",If you visit the London Eye you can go on the boat ride for free. We really recommend you do this as the Tower bridge from the water is an impressive sight. The gudies have a great knowledge about the historical buildings so you get a good general overview in a short period of time. Get there early so you can have a good seat in the front of the boat ,Great view!
"April 13, 2015","Before we went on, we went to the 4D movie which I highly recommend as it was a lot of fun and showed the things you would see from the top. The London eye itself is also great fun and you get your photo taken on it when your on the way down. There are little computers that tell you what each of the buildings are which is handy if your looking for one building in particular. The view from the top is amazing and you can almost see all of London. You definitely can't go to London and not go on the London eye!",Great view
"April 5, 2015",Worth the ride the view is well worth it and there is lots of other stuff to see around the wheel. And just across the brides is big ben,Not Worth the Visit Along With Rude Staff Members!
"April 4, 2015","My husband and I were visiting London from Hong Kong; my husband is originally from New Zealand and this was his first real trip to London I am a British citizen but left the UK 8 years ago. I have always wanted to take a trip on the London Eye and could say it was on my 'bucket list'. We visited the London Eye and bought tickets. We proceed to board and there were 2 security guards checking bags. I opened my bag as it had 3 zip pockets the gentleman checked one pouch but didn't bother with the other 2, he asked me did I have any sharp objects to which I replied no; he waved me on. My husband was dealt with by another member of staff I can only describe this man as an arrogant bully. He was adamant my husband had a bag containing belongings but it was a camera bag which was empty as the camera was around his neck we explained this and showed him inside the bag along with the camera but he continually bullied my husband asking him to stand to one side; when he did he said it was the incorrect place. Maybe if they want customers to stand in a specific place you appoint footprints like they do in all other security areas in the UK. Ironically they had a screening machine maybe they should use rather than treat customers in such an appalling manner. The way my husband was bullied by the member of staff was despicable and it appears there is no consistency in the way you treat people and this tarnished what was supposed to be a special trip. After disembarking we went to find the member of staff to get his security number or a photograph but he was not there. We have visited other iconic buildings i.e. the Statue of Liberty in the USA and were never dealt with like this. I was appalled to be British after treatment like this and I will never visit the London Eye nor recommend it to anybody. Along with the poor treatment we endured before boarding the attraction was very poor value for money, the view was disappointing, the cabin was extremely hot and the experience did not last long. Don't waste your money.",London Eye
"April 3, 2015","Beautiful views of London from here, i went in January for my brothers birthday and we paid to get onto the London eye you get fantastic views from each side. Definitely a attraction to go on. The staff at the London are very welcoming and friendly.",Overprice and awful customer service
"March 26, 2015",went with some visitors from abroad and had to wait over 30 min while we could see a lot of people jumping the queue and if there is a queue it must be followed...one can get to other high venues to see london from above without having to suffer the 45 min queue and overprice fee,Disappointing service 
"March 24, 2015","The view was amazing. You get one full round on the wheel and that's enough, the views on either side are wonderful and even on an overcast day like ours it was outstanding.  The service though of every single worker we came across was horrid. The 3 people taking our tickets out the front were having their own conversation completely,  didnt even look at us or say hello or anything. I now know too much about the fellas domestic with his boss. They were rude, didn't acknowledge anyone coming and going, and a separate group of workers pushed us out of the cabin at the end practically. Disappointing. ",Great ride- go in morning
"March 19, 2015","We happened to get there at 3pm on a Tuesday and there was no line which was great. The cabin holds 35 people so we were excited to have just 2 couples in ours. The views are excellent, but I'd say go in the morning because at 3pm the sun is on the back side of the Parliament/ Big Ben which makes pictures of it almost impossible. They just come out dark, even with our expensive dslr camera. Wish we had thought of that before boarding, because for the price we were not going to ride it again. ",Two words...FAST TRACK
"March 16, 2015","When you get there, if the queue is long, just pony up for the fast pass...we thought it was well worth it! Spectacular views. It moves very, very slow and each compartment is large and air conditioned.Loved it!","Niets aan, veel te duur"
"March 13, 2015","The evening view is good. But it's not -I would like to pay 30 euros PP - good. A definite waste of money if nothing is going on in the city. Yes the views are awesome, but since these views can be admired from inside the shard, it's just a fast diet for your wallet.",Average
"March 13, 2015",Me and my wife went on to the london eye it was a rainy day we sat into the cart and the windows of the cart were realy foggy we could hardly see out. They need to improve on this. It wasent worh the role👎👎,waist of time
"February 22, 2015","there are cities that are worth the view from above - new york, for example. however, london is not one of them. i love this city with all my heart - but the view from the top of the london eye isn't exciting at all.the long line and the long time we were on the london eye itself was boring and i wish i would never get on it. there are much better things to do in this wonderful city!",Must do!
"February 20, 2015","If you are in London and you dont go to the London Eye you didn't visit London. Forget about the price, just go! You will not be regretted. The view is amazing! You can get nice photos!",What can I say from up here
"February 20, 2015","Outstanding view. I came here with my misses just for a tour, it's been a while. Busy as you will expect. I use to live nearby, it was a quick walk around the corner for me and I kind of missed coming here. Great place for tour. Exciting time",Be aware of the time of your cruise!!
"February 20, 2015","We decided to do the London Eye section first, as we booked our tickets on the London Eye website. No where at all, no on the tickets, did it say that the booked time was for the RIVER CRUISE! We spent over £90 in total and didn't get chance to do the cruise section as we missed our time slot. No one at the ticket office was interested and refused to issue a refund. I suppose in hindsight it was our fault for not checking, but us assuming because we booked on the London Eye website, our time slot was naturally for the London Eye, but we were wrong. The Eye itself was fantastic but we felt let down by the cruise we couldn't have.",Very disappointing
"February 19, 2015",I was very disappointed when I paid the high price for this trip.  My fear of heights didn't cause the problem it was just the lack of wow factor that it had been built up to.  Save your pennies to get ripped off on another tourist attraction.,Great Attraction
"February 19, 2015","Being located right by the Thames gives great panoramic views of all the ""must see"" buildings around the area. Well worth a visit even on a wet day (as it was on our visit) the rain does not impede the great views.",Better places to see London
"February 18, 2015","I personally wouldn't bother queueing to go on the London Eye. It moves at snails pace and you don't get anything like the best view of London. I'd recommend tourists go to Parliament Hill, Greenwich Park or Alexandra Palace to get a good review...Those are all free and no need to queue!",Expensive but worth it!
"February 18, 2015",I was there by night and the view was breath-taking. The cabins are large enough for everyone to have their own space and enjoy the view from all the spots. Ride is long enough. I was very satisfied and would do it again !,Fantastic for people unafraid of heights
"February 13, 2015","We went on the London Eye not really taking into account how high this thing actually is. We had to look out and not down, but the views were really captivating. I would highly recommend the London eye, but give it some thought if you are scared of heights because when you're on it, you're on it.",Pre booked tickets 
"February 13, 2015",Great London iconic attraction .Pre booked tickets for eye and river trip for a time slot.About 50 minutes to que for a great view of the London skyline where you get to see all the London sites.,Not a must-do!
"February 13, 2015","As pretty as the London Eye looks from a distance especially when its lit up in the night, I'm afraid the view is not so breathtaking when you're in the capsule! London is not the prettiest city from a height unlike Paris or maybe Bergen. Having said that, let me add that it is one of my favorite cities in most other ways!As high as The Eye looks from below, its not much when you're right at the top and its definitely not enough height to appreciate the city. Also, the glass of the capsule was not clean the time I had gone so that was another dampener.I do understand that it has become quite an attraction since its opening but frankly you could give it a miss especially if the queues are long. Do it only if its something that you've been wanting to tick off your list but do not expect much!",Enjoyed the Guided Tour
"February 12, 2015","We purchased our tickets online and decided on the guided tour. Highly recommend you do this, especially during tourist season--they max it at 20 people vs capacity. Since it was off-season, there were only 5 of us, including our guide, so we got to move around, photograph and ask questions at will. A great way to see London and orient yourself, especially on a sunny day.",Great experience
"February 12, 2015",Had a great visit to the london eye definitley a must do when in London. Really enjoyed the overall experience the glass pods are very confortable and spacious enough for the amount of people we had in ours didn't feel cramped which was good. Goes at quite a slow pace so plenty time to take in all the sights wonderful views over London got nice photos as keepsakes from inside the pod aswell overall really enjoyed fairly priced Id say aswell for the experience 👍🇬🇧,Great to visit at night
"February 11, 2015","To start off, the view is incredible but I rather prefer the night view. It is during the night where some of the most beautiful photos are snapped. London at night is something completely different, it’s stunning!",An eye for an eye
"February 9, 2015","This is definitely something you must do at night.  Even if you have a fear of heights, the rotations is so slow and smooth, you will be more excited about the scenery.",There's no reason not to! 
"February 9, 2015","If one is making a trip to London I think it is practically mandatory to take a ride on the London eye as well as see Big Ben and perhaps the Royal Palace. A great way to view the cityscape and gauge the London skyline from right along the river. Fantastic view and quite a neat experience inside such a large ""merry go round"" One may also enjoy the stroll along the water where many people enjoy walking. Give it a go, you'll be glad you did. ",Beautiful view of London
"February 7, 2015","The London eye is a must, whether your on your own, with family or as a couple. The view is absolutely spectacular! my girl friend and i went twice, once during the day and again at night. To see London all lit up at night from the top of the Eye was amazing. we were lucky enough not to have to wait too long for tickets but i do recommend to purchase in advance as the lines can get long.",Overrated
"January 17, 2015","I never understood how peopke review the London Eye, or similar attractions in other cities if you ask me. I went becausr it became a London institution and you just simply have to go, even though it's not your thing. I will never make the same mistake. The London Eye is the epitomy of a tourist trap. Overhyped, overrated and overpriced. It offers a great view of London, granted. But at that price and waiting time is it really worth it? I don't think so. I can think of 10 better, or at least equally impressive views which can be viewed either for free, like parliament hill or while discovering an amazing place in London, like St. Paul's cathedral ",London eye
"January 9, 2015","Paid for fast track flexi tickets queued for an hour to pick tickets up, so not exactly flexi or easyThe actual trip on the eye was good though",New Years Eve in London - Disabled Viewing Area at London Eye
"January 4, 2015","If you are disabled and thought it would be a wonderful experience to join with fellow celebrants to bring in the New Year in London in 2016 - my advice would be please don't.The designated viewing are for those with disabilities was quite frankly horrendous, showing a complete lack of understanding for those with disabilities that we don't come across quite so often in this day and age, thank goodness.  Toilets were up a steep flights of stairs - not so good for those with walking difficulties, Those attending were hidden well out of view of the main celebration, I don't think I have ever (or for many years) felt so insulted or disheartened on behalf of my disabled son,  Mr Johnson and his event team should hang their arrogant heads in shame.  I am happy to pay and be considered a first class citizen rather than the third class, penned in on the side of Albert Embankment.  Thank goodness it didn't rain!!!!",Waste of time and money
"May 8, 2008","I expected a guide, or even a recorded message to play during the 30 minute trip, maybe pointing out some things of interest or what not.I was mistaken. It's just you and a handful of strangers in a small pod for half an hour, in awkward silence.For the price I'm sure you could visit other more interesting tall buildings/cathedrals/etc. to get the same views. If you must go, the best time to do it would be on a regular weekday (non-holiday), and take the first 'trip' at 10am. We bought regular, non-fast track tickets online before going, and then showed up at the ticket office at 9:30am. We were the very first people to step into the pod that day, no waiting, and no need to pay for the fast-track.",Interesting views
"March 25, 2008","What can I say...........it is a one of a kind experience and the views are spectacular.  The cost, not unlike everything in London, is very expensive, so get used to it quickly or it may ruin your holiday.  We saved a little by booking on-line which also saves you a ton of time picking up your tickets at the kiosk, just put in your card you paid for the tickets with and out they come.  The line-ups look enormous but at 30 people per car they move along very quickly.  Worth the money just in picture value alone.........bring a zoom lense.",Tip for large parties
"July 24, 2007","I went on the London Eye as part of a hen weekend.  There were 15 of us, and we booked a private pod, which only worked out to be about £5 more per head.  The difference this made to the experience was huge.  We went to a seperate desk, waited a couple of minutes and were then escorted over to the eye where we bypassed all the queues and got on the next available pod.  If you are considering going on the Eye and you are a large party, it is definately worth doing this - it made all the difference.Having said that the queues did look like they moved quite fast, but if you have a lot of people and a schedule to stick to its definately the way to go!I can't comment on the actual booking procedure, because my friend actually booked it in person a couple of months before, but I'm sure the website will give you all the info.",Breathtakingly Beautiful
"June 28, 2007","The London Eye is modern, spectacular, gargantuan and beautiful. The London Eye provides visitors with views across the world's most famous city and the views do not disappoint. One can see world famous landmarks, such as The Palace of Westminster, St. Paul's Cathedral, Buckingham Palace, the BT Tower, Canary Wharf, the list is endless. The Eye is a world-renowned landmark, it is an architectural masterpiece. The London eye is a beautiful, modern structure that symbolises a new, modern and successful London. It is undoubtedly a truly breathtaking creation.",Something different
"June 20, 2007","I start by admitting I am not a great fan of London as such but do have friends who live here so I do go back every once in a while. Having ''done'' all the usual touristy things in previous years, we thought the London Eye would be a nice change. And it surely was ! We booked online (as recommended by our friends) which was a good move as we bypassed all the queues. We were lucky and had beautiful weather so it was a real treat to see London from above and even make out the new Wembley Stadium in the distance. After the tour we strolled around the much improved South Bank area and had a spot of lunch in one of the many restaurants with outside tables (which makes great people watching)Considering what most tourist attractions cost in Edinburgh, Scotland taking a ride on the London Eye was not that expensive and really, the views are worth it. The wheel actually moves very slowly - in fact you can't even feel it move (I am saying his because many people asked me who were too scared to go on it) but it really is very pleasant. The capsule is big enough to walk around or sit in the middle if you wish.Also, you get a superb view of the whole architecture as such while the Eye moves and it makes for some interesting pictures.",A must for everyone
"June 9, 2007","As I live quite close to London it was a pleasant surprise when my daughter suggested that we took her little boy (my grandson) up to town one day. They were staying with us and she thought that a trip on the British Airways London Eye might be nice.We only waited for a few minutes for tickets and then a few more minutes to actually board the flight. The day was a bit dull but that meant you could take photographs without getting too many reflections. Upstream views included St Thomas' Hospital close by and views of the river bending away to the right towards Battersea. On a clear day you can see as far as Windsor Castle. But don't get carried away with distant views when almost directly in front of you is a wonderful view of the the Palace of Westminster. In part of this building are the houses of Lords and Commons and I swear you see the haze of hot air coming up from it!!Looking downstream (Right) the river quickly bends away to the right and affords nice views of the City of London, St Paul's and many bridges and churches. The view of the roof of Waterloo Station is stunning.Look to the north (rive end of the pod!) to see the post office tower. If you have a map with you you can pin point Horseguards Parade, St James Park, New Zealand house, the RAF Memorial on the opposite bank of the river and many more sights. As a senior citizen it cost me £11.00 to fly the wheel and I can't wait to go again.",What an experience!
"May 2, 2007","The London Eye - half an hour of amazement!We queued from right at the back of the last 'boarding gate' at 12.30pm on a sunday, but it only took us half an hour to get into our 'capsule'.  I think this was a very busy time, because we saw very little queues on Sunday afternoon and all day Monday (we were only staying round the corner)It was very organised.  There were some cute souvenirs.  I'd recommend buying te 360 degree guide so you can pick out buildings when you are in the air.  We didn't buy it and didn't know what we were looking at apart from the obvious buildings!I don't THINK I'd do it again.  Then again, I haven't been on it at night time yet!Even though the capsules are air conditioned, it still got hot at the top, even in April!Enjoy!",The London Eye
"April 15, 2007","I was in London as part of a group, and was not overly thrilled that the London Eye was part of out attractions.  To my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed the experience!  The views were beautiful, and it was a nice peaceful break from the otherwise busy city.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.  The ""pods"" are large , clean, and provide 360 degree views of this wonderful city.",Good Weather Only
"December 12, 2006","I hopped on the Eye last month. Great views from above! It was sunny at first but then the heavy rain poured down and blocked the view for the rest of my ride. Go on the Eye in good weather only! Also, I'd recommend to buy tickets online as crowds could get out of control.",Probably the best thing to do in London.
"October 25, 2006","I've been on the Eye a couple of times now - during the day and at night - and it has to be one of the ""must do"" things if you're visiting London. The views of the city are stunning and with it taking approximately half an hour to go right around, you have time to see everything. Having said that, by the time you have to get off you just wish you could around one more time!If you go in the daytime, I would say to be prepared for some queueing (not much fun, although I've heard that if you pay extra you can get a fast-track ticket). However, on my last visit we got there at 7.55pm (literally 5 mins before closing time) and there were only a handful of people, which meant that we not only didn't have to queue, but also that there were only a few of us in the capsule, enabling us to walk around inside it and get to see the full 360 degrees. The view at night was spectacular too.I can recommend this attraction to anyone - it's great for kids, older people and it's also a romantic thing to do with someone special. Well worth the money!",Eye in the sky
"August 25, 2012","I have been on the Eye 4 times now. This time was definately the best simply because it was sunny. When you arrive in London try to have a list of to do's ready and put them as either inside or outside things to do. As soon as it starts it rain (and it will), head for the galleries, V&A, shows, tours etc. When the sun smiles on you jump on the Eye the Thames River Cruise and watch the changing of the guard etc. oh yes pack a brolly.",Relaxing View of London
"June 19, 2012","We went back and forth about purchasing tickets ahead of time but ended up buying the tickets at the ticket booth when we were ready to ride.  We were 15 minutes in the ticket line and then waited only 15 minutes more to ride.  There was not a ""Family rate"" in line as advertised.  All in all, we did not want to miss this attraction and we are glad we did it.  The views were beautiful.  And those of us slightly afraid of heights had no problem.  We even bought our picture!",Do the VIP package
"June 16, 2012",Its the only way to do it . No queuing and a tour guide who supplies champagne on the journey. Done it a few times and dusk is the best as the lights of London just come on .,Jubilee weekend disaster!
"June 5, 2012","We booked a time slot of 3.30 in Feb to see the Jubilee River Pageant.  Turned up 40mins early to scenes of total chaos.  I have no idea they had hugely overbooked it but the queues were enormous.  After about a half hour wait they told everyone with 3.30 tickets to get out of the queue retaining only the 3pm ones.  We stayed put and just as well.  Didn't get onto the eye till 3.45 and luckily did see the Queen's barge - missed all the inital boats though.  Worst than that though was the fact they had 3 GREAT BIG SCREENS where they could have been showing all the action but they chose not to do that and continue with their normal advertising crap.  So we queued for well over an hour, missing the action a few feet from us while watching this rubbish.  I felt sorry for the 3.30 bookings who actually did what they were told as they wouldn't have seen a minute of the celebrations on the water.  The Eye has had years to prepare for this, what on earth happened?  Also it had absolutely no decoration whatsoever for the Jubilee, nothing at all to celebrate a momentous occasion.  Shame on you London Eye!  ",Good views
"May 18, 2012",Good views of the city but it's not exactly cheap. I bought the greenscreen photo they offered and it was a poor quality photo considering I paid about $18 for it.,Expansive Views of the City!
"May 18, 2012","If you've done the London-by-bus, and the London-by-river, try London-by-The-Eye! This attraction is not a good idea for those with a fear of heights, even with the very comfortable (and SAFE!) interiors, as the ride from entry to exit is about 30 minutes. Be aware that buying the ticket and queuing for to get into and Eye room can take hours, especially during Summer months and nice weather. Either buy ahead of time, or plan on arriving as early as possible to avoid long waits. Every few minutes the see-through room you and your co-passengers ride to a different vantage point. The 360 degree visibility allows for people to move around the room. There are the to-be-expected rushes of all riders to one section of window for photographic opportunities, particularly when your room moves to an iconic view, but most passengers walk around the room the entire time. Though expensive, the ride on the Eye and the accompanying souvenier book (that label the buildings you will see) are well worth the cost. This is basically a self-guided tour of London, you will see the over-view, the skyline and get the names of the buildings, but you won't get the stories offered on the bus and boat tours. As a positive - the Eye room is always climate controlled and still enjoyable on rainy days, though it is definitely best to enjoy when its sunny.",London as you never see it
"May 17, 2012",I was skeptical about going on the London Eye as it seemed to be a glorified bit wheell.  I was wrong.  The unique perspective of London that can be gained from the Eye is truly wonderful. Seeing how pieces of the city connect together is enlightening.  Turning slowly round as you take in a view of the snaking Thames is enchanting.,More than just a ferris wheel
"April 30, 2012",Starts with a wonderful IMAX theater experience.  You can't get a better view of Central London.  More than 30 minutes of photo opportunities.,Great view of London!
"April 30, 2012","This attraction is located near Big Ben.We did the 3D London Eye show as well (it was included in the price of our ticket). The 3D experience of the London Eye was a nice little show of London (very cute)! It's not necessary in my opinion but a nice little addition.We got on the London Eye and the entire thing takes maybe a little less than 30 minutes.You have plenty of oppportunities for pictures and I liked that you could read about what you were seeing.You actually don't need to buy the map they sell you when you're getting your ticket because once you get on the london eye, they have a ""virtual"" map that you can play with showing you exactly the same thing!","Miserable, disorganized, over priced and insanely crowded"
"April 30, 2012","Simple rule. If you have heard of the tourist attraction in London, then don't go. We literally had to put our heads down and shove like we were trying to get onto a Japanese commuter rail just to walk the sidewalk on the way to the London Eye. On a Sunday afternoon (5:00pm). In the pouring rain. After I had already bought tickets online to avoid waiting...Then we waited in a 1/2 line (which was required to learn which line you were actually supposed to wait in). Then we were directed to the real line  - which was then 1 hour long. In the rain. Surrounded by thousands of other tourists - all pushing for their place in the endless lines. In the end, We left, with paid tickets in hand and ran for our life. If you must go - go as early as possible and prepare the push, shove and work your way into endless crowds. As this was April, I can only imagine what sort of living nightmare awaits summer visitors during the Olympics.",Well worth the money. Buy tickets in advance.
"March 30, 2011","If you want to see the whole of London visit the Eye. The views are great. On Monday morning there was no queue. We tried first on Friday evening but the queues to both tickets and then the eye were long. For Monday we bought the tickets in advance at a kiosk and were able to just walk in. Again, as almost always in London, the staff were great.",Nice Experience
"March 29, 2011","Had a Merlin Annual Pass but still had to queue, waited for half an hour till we got on. (They let groups of schoolkids fastrack the queue!) Our pod was pretty packed, had to squeeze in to get a view out of the window. Got very hot as you got to the top (and that was on a spring day- can imagine how hot it gets on a summers day!) Luckily there is air conditioning on the sides. Brilliant views of London and you can get a photo done at the end. Takes about half an hour to get around, really enjoyed it, will be going again as i forgot to take my camera this time!",Amazing! Views are incredible!
"March 12, 2011",We booked combination tickets online before we went. We arrived first thing in a morning and there wasnt much of a queue. The pods are quite big and the views were breath taking! The pics we took turned out fantastic! The 4D Experience was fab too! Would defo recommend! when we go again we are going to go on at night time and see how that looks!,"Pick your weather, companions and times of day."
"March 1, 2011",I think we were very lucky. Our daytime trip was on a colourful bright morning where everything looked clear and close and the views were absolutely spectacular. Better I think than those from the Empire State Building. The speed is just right. Make sure if you possibly can that the other passengers are tolerable and considerate. Frustrated disinterested kids or sullen miserable adults do not enhance the experience. We went back a year later in the dark evening which was amazing. Weather and visibility are everything.,Impressed with the service
"February 27, 2011",Booked the eye on line for a visit with my parents for a special weekend. Ok so it was rainy so the views could have been better but hey ho we live in the UK so used to that.What has prompted me to write the review is the exceptional customer service we received from the eye staff. I had booked the tickets for a set time - picked them up and we were due on at 11. There was quite a long queue which we were ok with but when the staff saw my dad with his stick (not officially disabled but 80 with knee problem) they pulled us out of the queue and walked us slowly and kindly to the front then stopped the eye so dad could take his time getting in. Great experience seeing everything on the pod (once in lifetime for my folks) and then when we got off they stopped it again to give him time to get off.Lovely people who didn't need any official stuff to understand that someone needed a little more time to enjoy the experienceThank you eye staff you made all of our days,Be CAREFUL of cash transactions in gift shop
"July 21, 2010","My husband and I visited the London eye on Monday June 7th.We really enjoyed the experience.Afterwards  I bought souvenir gifts for our 4 children.I paid cash.The tall male on the till had an American accent and was very loud and distracting,shaking one item 3 times to 'check' that it wasn't broken and speaking in a very loud voice to no one in particular.I had to request a receipt following the transaction.I realised when leaving the shop and counting my change that  he had overcharged me.When I checked  my receipt I got a shock to see that only ONE item was on my receipt.I had purchased and paid for 7 items and extra.Unfortunately I couldn't re-enter the shop because now I had 6 items with no proof of purchase and technically could be called a shop lifter.So my advice to you all is REQUEST a receipt BEFORE you hand over your cash.",Please don't waste your money here!  It's a tourist rip-off now.
"July 14, 2010","I went on the London Eye for the third time yesterday when my American cousin was in town.  The last time I had been on was 4 years ago and it was a very special experience as we went on a night flight and it was quiet and peaceful.  Also, 4 years ago the cost was only around £8.00 as the London Eye was owned by BA.Imagine my shock yesterday to find that the cost was £17 per person (what inflationary measure had they used there?!!!) and the attraction had been taken over by Merlin Entertainments (the UK's answer to Disney and all that corporate rip-off).  Also, although I am on benefits that give me discounts at all galleries, concerts and most attractions, there were no discounts available at all.  I also felt that the Eye itself is looking a little tired.  One pod had a free-standing air conditioning unit in it.  One pod went around empty for some reason and one pod was missing altogether.  For the cost now charged - everything should be in tip-top condition.  Even the staff seeing us on were of poorer quality then then used to be!The only good thing is that we purposely chose a quieter time of week and day than most people so we didn't wait long and the queue moved fast.  We also didn't waste time on stupid 4D movies.  If the queue had been long we wouldn't have bothered.The pod was full and, whereas on my previous flights people walked around the pod to see different sights, when you are on the flight with tourists (sorry tourists!) they don't think there are any interesting buildings on the south bank of the river!!!  So they take up residence in the best position overlooking the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace and stay there the whole time - not letting anyone else in.I wouldn't recommend pre-booking either as it would be a very poor experience to have booked tickets then find that the weather is grey and wet and the visibility poor. In conclusion, if you MUST go on the London Eye and have decided that views from St. Paul's / the walkway above Tower Bridge / Monument /  or out on Hampstead Heath / Greenwich / Shooters Hill / Alexander Palace just won't do - please think outside the box and go in the evening and in good weather.",Waste of money
"June 11, 2010","My 8 year old wanted to be on it as it looked so giant and fun etc.etc.... But what a waste of money. First of all it is way expensive for the ride. Spending all that money for a family of four just to be on it for a short time was a total waste of time and money. See it from a distance and spend your money else where. Long lines for waiting, they wouldn't let one member stay in line for all and them let the others join later.",London Eye - Well worth it!
"May 3, 2010","I am a bit scared of heights, but the London Eye is a very gentle 'ferris wheel' where you can see all of London.  We took numerous photos at each 'stop.'  So enjoyable.But, even better than the view is the Champagne Flight.  I highly recommend pre-purchasing tickets via VisitBritain.com.  In addition to already having the tickets and thus, avoiding the wait, you can make your purchase in American dollars.  With our vouchers in hand, we were whisked on to the attraction within minutes, while we saw some many people lined up to go on.  Plus, there are a lot less people in your individual 'pod.'  And, if you like champagne, it's a delight.  The guy that served us was very nice and offered to tell us anything about the sights.  We also received a booklet for free outlining the various attractions (I can't remember the cost, but it was extra for the others.)I heard that the Eye was going to be dismantled last year and perhaps only kept for the 2012 Olympics.  I think that would be a shame!  In the 10 years that it's been in London, I believe it has become a great fixture to the town.  Highly recommend going and also having the champagne!",Brilliant!
"April 26, 2010","The title says it all ...The new 4D experience (included in ticket price) was fantastic ... it had the adults amazed as much as the kids.  Excellent use of 3D cinematography with a little extra to make it seem all the more real (won't say here as don't want to spoil it for you).  The ride on the Eye was on a clear day and thirty minutes was just about the right amount of time to take it all in.  Had three nine year olds and a hyper six year old with me and none of them got bored.This is a London must do and if you follow the advice on the London Eye website and turn up and check in 45minutes before your ""flight"" it runs like clockwork and stress free despite the site being a pretty busy place.  I'm not sure I'd bother with the extra expense of a fast track ticket ... we just had a standard flexi and we didn't queue for very long at all.  We visited on a normal Sunday in mid April.",great photo opportunity!
"September 16, 2006","the waiting in lines is mighty tedious, and the ride is a bit expensive. But the for great photo memories to share, it is a must see!",Brilliant experience
"January 25, 2006","Excellent experience, whether you travel day or evening, but best to avoid if it's raining!",Loved it!
"January 10, 2006",This was definitely worth doing. The view was great and you can get some wonderful pictures.,Really OUTSTANDING
"October 20, 2004",The London Eye experience was really fascinating.  I think it is the perfect programme for a sunny afternoon.,Well worth it
"September 11, 2003","I thought the London Eye was absolutely excellent and well worth the money it costs to get on it. whilst on the Eye, you feel very safe, particularly since each pod is bomb-checked between each party that rides in it. The only thing that was slightly annoying was the dripping water which splattered us form time to time, and it can get pretty hot (obviously!) in those pods. Overall, a must if you are visiting London; you'll regret it if you don't!",Eyes for a Beautiful View!
"October 2, 2023",Grand view and mesmerising to see the venue and the surroundings!! On a clear day you can get some fabulous pictures and rides !,Great views
"August 23, 2023",It was good but not great. Quite a few people in the pod so couldn't see all of the views. Nicely air-conditioned though. Views were lovely though ,Good Deal if bought as a combo
"October 4, 2022","The attraction is overpriced if you buy just a standard ticket.The best value for money is if you buy a combo ticket that gives you Madame Tussaud, Sealife, London Eye and Cruise for 68 pounds (from the londoneye website). At the time of writing this, the 4D experience at London eye was discontinued, so that was a dampener.Go to the website, and buy a combo for Madame Tussaud, Sealife and London Eye that costs 60 pounds. During checkout it will give you an option to add a cruise for 8 pounds. These four are perfect for a full-day family outing with kids. Do Madame Tussauds in the morning (10am), followed by stopover at Buckingham Palace (optional), then go on to the London eye pier and grab a nice fish & chips lunch. Follow that up with Sea life, London Eye and finally the cruise (they are all adjacent to each other).You will be able to fin all this by around 5.30pm. Relax at the riverback with a nice icecream cone and watch the sun set. A busy but relaxed itinerary that will be fun for the kids as well. If you are still feeling energetic, you could try squeeze out a visit to Trafalgar square in the evening by bus, and visit the National gallery for some cool paintings.",Pre-booking time slot is an absolute joke!!!
"July 27, 2022",WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!You need to make it obvious on your booking sites that when you book your time... this is the time you can actually join the already ridiculously long queue and is NOT the time you actually access the attraction!! Our tickets were for 2.30 and we got there in plenty of time to join the queue so we could get on the London Eye at our allotted time. However we were kicked out of the queue twice and not allowed to join the queue itself until exactly 2.30pm.Very very disorganised and staff attitudes are shocking. Not what you expect from such a highly priced event.Event organisers don’t understand the knock on effect the time slot problem has on other planned activities/travel etc. The time we eventually got on the London Eye was an hour and half from the time slot booked so what is the point in pre-booking I just don’t get it.The pre-booking time slot is an absolute joke and false advertising that you need to rectify or you will continue to have some very angry customers!!Sort it!,Total caos.
"July 26, 2022","It’s my second time in London Eye. I should say that was disapointed the way It’s organizated the entrance to the wheel. There were caos every were! A long line to get to the next “control Point”, but we wasn ‘t check anywere. No body ask our tickets, a girl tryed to send us to make the long first line again. In the middle of the caos of the line, my wife luckily got a ticket with a pink mark, if that hasn’t happened we would had to do the line again.There were people of the staf shouting everywere but they were unable to control the situation.It Was very unpleasant experiencie.Of course the “fligth” is an amazing way to get a view of the city, but they need que get improve in the way they organize the entrance.",Not fast track
"December 15, 2020","So I paid the extra for the fast track when we got there was about 20 people in front, the lady said fast track go in the other way (excellent) only to be stopped at the top of the stairs and had to wait till everyone in the normal cue had been searched my the slowest security in the world so I won’t be paying extra againOn the ride it self the views are amazing even with it being a wet December morning ",Chloe
"December 15, 2020",My husband and I enjoyed an afternoon cruise along the river.Chloe our host was a cheerful lady who gave us a fantastic insight into some of the landmarks along the way.We learnt so much from her well presented guide with lots of laughs along the way.She is a credit to your company.,Family day out 
"December 14, 2020",The night view is the best especially during Christmas. COVID précautions taken very seriously! Kids loved it... the adults equally loved it too. ,London Eye: Do It just to do it
"November 18, 2020",The London Eye was fun. Don’t expect much from it besides long lines and a simple ride in a Farris wheel. The history lesson and views from the top are amazing! Worth doing just to say you did it.,slow
"November 14, 2020","maybe if it was faster it would be more enjoyable🙄✋ sis is just a big, slow enclosed ferris wheel. chariots of fire n dat",Great View. Slow moving
"November 14, 2020",Great view. 30 minutes of slow moving torture. I am scared of heights. Good  thing they had a place to sit down.,First date
"November 6, 2020","Went on a first date.Lovely experience.Was supposed to be sharing but the family after us refused to join our ride so we had it all to ourselves, maybe due to covid.Our temperatures were taken and hand sanitizer available.It's only one revolution but you do get great views of London. You are fully enclosed so sheltered from the elements which was raining most of the day.Would recommend if visiting London but pricey for what it is.",Experience 
"October 31, 2020",Good for an experience. A nice 30 minute trip to take in the sites of London. Good social distancing followed. ,Expensive but worth it
"October 31, 2020","Visited with my husband, 6 year old and 3 month old.  Booked tickets whilst there and only had to queue for 5 minutes.  We had our own pod and had a brill time.  Lasts about 30-40 mins so not too long and whilst it’s not something I’d do every time we’re in London it’s definitely an experience I’d recommend doing at least once.",A-star for Almiro
"October 30, 2020","We did the champagne experience with Almiro as our host, the whole experience was worth every penny and Almiro was brilliant couldn't have asked for a nicer bloke. He knew everything about the landmarks when asked and is a credit to the London Eye.From his Manchester mates 😎🤘🐝",london eye toilets disgrace.
"November 23, 2012","The london eye is very good to visit ,book on line and save a few pounds,make sure you have a camera or eye phone ,found the toilets to be a discrace very small very dirty,smelt , for a big attraction,who ever designed the building shud be sacked.",Bit of a wait but good view
"November 14, 2012","The view is good but the wait was a bit long. Fortunately the weather was not too cold, would hate to stand in the cold wet weather. Not too sure its worth the wait but maybe for first timers it is good as you do get a birds-eye view ",Wine Tasting on the London Eye
"November 1, 2012","We took the  Vinopolis Wine Tasting on the London Eye.  The pre-paid tour went off flawlessly with no waiting in the long lines to get on the Eye.  We tasted five wines and this tour included two rotations of the ride.  Normally I don't like  heights, but for some reason this wasn't a problem.  The vista from the ride is amazing and I was able to get good photos too!  This was our first trip to London and I would recommend this ride/tour.",Can't fault it
"October 24, 2012","There were 20 of us on a celebratory night out last night. We were all in one pod together, and two staff joined us to offer champagne and nibbles. Plenty of room to move around, you could have mingled another 20 people in there. The whole experience was fantastic, amazing night-time views over London, with some touch-screen info points in the pod. Would definitely go again.",What a view
"October 12, 2012","This attraction is VERYWELL ORGANISED despite loads of people milling about, from buying the ticeket to riding the eye, took no more than thirtyfive minutes, and what a fantastic experience and view i was, again well worth a visit and the money.",Its not an actuall eye
"October 6, 2012","I dont like heights, and I didn't like this my wife and daughter loved it i read the news paper and pretended i was elsewhere. If you don't like heights dont go near it. Apparently the views are great",Champagne experience - absolutely incredible
"September 30, 2012","I have been wanting to go on the London Eye for years, so when my father-in-laws birthday came round, it was the perfect opportunity. We did the champagne experience, which was worth every penny.If you are going on the Eye at the weekend, you need to factor in plenty of time for queueing - once to buy your ticket, and again to take your ride. Booking online helps with the first, and the champagne experience definitely helps with the second. Between showing up and getting into the booth took about 15 minutes.I'm not going to go on about the views, when you are 110 meters up in a glass bubble, you know they're going to be pretty good! Short version - the Eye is worth every penny, and I can't wait to go up again at night. If you have the time, it is an essential tourist destination.",Once is enough
"September 27, 2012","My husband and I were super excited to do the London Eye Experience, especially after seeing it from afar.  I booked advance tickets online, thinking we would be able to pick-up our tickets and avoid the long lines.  That was my first mistake, you have to go to another building a little bit away from the London Eye and stand in a long line to pick-up you tickets and then stand in another super long line to get on the attraction itself.  So, booking in advance, for a set time, did not make much of a difference.  Although the other non pre-booked ticket long was a little longer.  I guess there is an option to fast track this line for a little more money when you book online.  We got in the super long line worried that we were going to miss our dinner reservations.  I have to say the line moved quickly and we were on the ride in about ten-fifteen minutes.  The ride itself and the views were pretty cool, at first, and then after about ten minutes we were ready to get off and move on.  It moves super slow and you have to wait until it goes all the way around, which takes about 25-30 minutes.  I am so grateful I did not pay the extra cost online for a private car or the champagne experience, it definitely wouldn't have been worth it.  I would say the London Eye is a must do, and I am glad I did it, but once is enough.","Too expensive? Sure, but great fun to see everything from so high up. Loved it!"
"September 26, 2012","Even in the early stages of planning this trip to London, going on the London Eye was a ‘must do’ and it did not disappoint. In fact it was beyond my expectations! This is something you should really splurge on as part of your holiday in London, as the views are stunning. I especially think it’s great as one of the first things a first-timer to London should do. It’s kind of a nice dramatic introduction to London. The venue itself is quite nice. While the lines are long and look rather intimidating at first, they move rather quickly. I don’t think buying the ‘fast track’ tkt is worth the extra cost, in my opinion.  Just be patient for a short bit, and you’ll get there soon enough. The first part of the experience is that you watch a 4D presentation. Frankly, I expected it to be rather lame and a waste of time. So wrong! It was, in fact, amazing, with great graphics and special effects. I went from thinking it was going to be a waste, to being disappointed when it was over, as I wanted more, lol.  In any event, you’re there for the Eye, and what of it? Well, it’s just an amazing piece of engineering which offers some stunning views of some of London’s most icon buildings.  The capsules are brilliant, in that they are comfy, well-equipped with nice information displays and move so precisely that you literally don’t even know your moving. It’s really amazing. So in closing, you know what I’m going to recommend, right? Just go and enjoy the Eye for a different view of Parliament, Big Ben and all the rest of the other famous London sights.Hope this helps.",Stunning views
"August 25, 2012","Another requested outing with our Grandson for his annual stay wth us in the Summer holidays.  We had a two for one voucher which most people in the queue seemed to have so the cost wasn't too bad.  There were queues to get a ticket but they moved very quickly and we felt this was organised well.  We went to the 4D cinema which was good fun for a 4 minute film before going on the eye.  Being in the height of the holidays, we expected to queue for a long time to get on but it was very quick.  We were fortunate that it was a good day so could see for miles.  The computer touch screens in the pods were not too helpful but we could point out most things our Grandson wanted to see.  It really is worth doing once and I would love to do it at night.",Personal pod
"September 11, 2020",Due to COVID 19 there were no queues for the pods. We had pre booked anyway using our Merlin passes. We went straight on and had our own pod!,First time visit
"September 11, 2020","This was our first time on the London Eye and with having series height issues I must admit it was truly amazing, so breathtaking were the views that I wanted to stay on and go round again. Can really recommend this as one of the best things to do in London. Can't wait to go on it again. Its such a cool thing to do. Thanks to all the staff also.",Awesome experience!
"September 10, 2020","Absolutely awesome!! I have to be honest: I was scared stiff and had dreams of lying down on the seat with my eyes closed for the whole 30 minutes, the night before, but not necessary! It was scary stepping on and  off, and for those a little faint hearted, have someone to hand to help you and don't stand near the edge of the pod, but other than that, it was brilliant.  The views are stunning especially in the good weather we had. The Eye moves so slowly that at first you dont realise you are moving and I did eventually manage to leave the safety of the seat. Unrivalled, especially with the disappointment of The Shard being closed for our booked visit. Highly recommended and well worth the money.",Very good
"September 8, 2020",This was so much fun. We had great weather when we went but me and my 10 year old really enjoyed it. I would highly recommend. It was good to see a few sights at once and the guide AJ was full of energy. It broke up our day quite nicely and was thoroughly enjoyable.,Excellent views
"September 29, 2020",With all the current social distancing taking place it was great to only have one other couple in the pod. Could move around freely and most miss a view. ,Good but a guide book or local info needed
"September 28, 2020","We loved this but I have to say not being from London, other than the obvious land marks like big Ben and the Palace I had no idea what else I was looking at.A little leaflet or place with info would be ideal to make the most of the experience.Other than that great 30/40 worth doing ",Nice wiew
"September 23, 2020",Very nice boat trip .well enjoyed.highly recomended.our boat guide very good .he's. Explained London history,Scenic
"September 23, 2020","Really clear views high  across London,  we had the whole pod to ourselves which was an added bonus !  Would recommend you  go on the Eye as part of a ""Attraction "" deal as maybe a bit hefty a price on its own ","Great views, great value"
"September 20, 2020","We went to the lastminute.com London Eye, as we were going to London from Manchester and we had never been to the London Eye, although we had been to Central London several times. It was quite expensive for 2 adults and 1 child but we had used a £20 Tesco Clubcard voucher, and we paid the rest by card.At the main day, staff checked our temprature and let us in, like most attractions in this COVID time. We had photos taken both in and out of the pod and we went in to the pod, which only had 2 other households in it. I felt that might be a bit uncomfortable in this COVID period, the pod was a bit huge, so it was easy for social distancing. Like they said, there was some great views! Even though I think £2 for a soveniur coin is a bit expensive, the pods were very clean and overall, it was a great experience! They also give you a 30% voucher for lastminute.com.","Great cruise, a fun way to learn."
"September 2, 2020","Great cruise, Jack who was our tour guide very informative and funny! It’s a great way to learn about the city.",Fill in time 
"September 2, 2020",It was ok but not worth £60 to go round in a circle  I suppose I’m not the best one to comment as I prefer to see things up close and personal ie major land marks but no one insisted I go on so maybe I should just shut up 🤐😂,"Overpriced but,"
"August 31, 2020","I must say that this experience is genuinely overpriced for what it is. At the end of the day you're going on a ""modified Ferris wheel"" so I think that the ticket prices are quite over exaggerated. However, if you are a tourist, or you have never been on the London Eye, then I would still recommend it as you can get a great view on a good day. Just be prepared to save up some money for this specific attraction.",Fast track worth it
"August 30, 2020","We checked our 1st london to do list here, and it was the right decision. Beautiful 1st glance, and the time we saved from fast track spared us a lot to check on other attractions nearby rather than longer queue.Despite big ben was still under major renovation, but the view from here was really splendid.Great service from the staff also. ",not covid friendly sadly
"August 30, 2020",The eye itself is good but in covid times there is no distancing whilst waiting in line and you have other people in your pod. We are a 5 and another group of 4 joined us. They had no respect to stay on their side which bothered and was not wearing a 😷,Amazing
"August 30, 2020","This is amazing,if you come to London,you must find time and go to famous London Eye and visit this place. All the best.",Bit warm 
"September 20, 2020",Some great views of London we had a hot hot day was starting to get uncomfortable in the pod with the heat I much say made us feel safe we had our own pod with sanitizer staff where helpful ,Excellent views of London 
"September 19, 2020",Booked the London Eye online. Due to Covid-19 we got a pod to ourselves which was excellent. Pods were cleaned regularly. Excellent views. Friendly staff. Well worth a visit.,Disgraceful customer service
"September 14, 2020","Absolutely disgusted by my visit today. As regular visitors to London and after experiencing the London eye multiple times (due to us having a merlin annual pass) I have to say I have never been more appalled and embarrassed by their customer service today. There was one couple in front of us (already at the boarding gate) when we were told to wait for our turn. The operator allowed the couple onto their pod, we didn’t get invited forward until their pod door had closed. We were then invited onto our pod alongside a single rider, someone who wasn’t wearing their mask properly and who was constantly moving around whilst waiting. This made me anxious so my partner and I got out of the pod. The operators stopped the eye and asked why we got off, so we informed them of the situation and questioned why, if 6 people per pod is their policy, did the other couple Get their own and us (plus the other guy) weren’t sharing. The customer service from their colleague Yasmin was disgraceful. She was bordering on yelling at us and wouldn’t let my husband speak. She kept diverting the question of ‘why were we made to wait when we could have gone on as a 5 with the other couple?’ Her response was ‘well you can wait but I guarantee you won’t get your own pod like that couple’ so disrespectful as that wasn’t what we were asking. One rule for one and one for another. Then, their ‘duty manager’ tried to sort the situation, she again refused to answer the question and whilst speaking to my husband, told him to wait and began dealing with another complaint from a group of people. We gave up and walked away. Disgraceful.",Enjoyable
"September 14, 2020","We really enjoyed this cruise, the tour guide was funny, friendly and informative. We got to see all of the sites around London and was given the history about the specific site.",Delightful and very informative 
"September 11, 2020",My family and I had a lovely cruise today at 1245. The tour guide (Jon?) was very amusing and informative and the tour was a lovely way to see lots of the sights of central London in an efficient and very civilised manner!I would highly recommend it!,London Eye must see
"March 17, 2020",Iconic part in London. We did not have time to actually take a ride on the london eye but it is very beautiful on the outside and to get views from the bridge. Love the colors in the evening time too,London Eye
"March 17, 2020","If you have an opportunity to ride on the London Eye on a sunny day, do so. The views are spectacular from all positions on this 30-minute circular tour. Arrive early to avoid long lines.",We Loved It
"March 16, 2020",We made our reservations on-line to ride the Eye late in the day so that we would see the lights come on in London about the time we reached the pinnacle.  There was not a cloud in the sky and the view was specatular.  It was a good value and an experience we will not soon forget.,London Eye River Cruise.
"March 16, 2020",Having visited the London eye and the river cruise for my wife’s 50th Birthday. We had a fantastic time on the river cruise with the excellent and very knowledgeable commentary from # Vicky. It really made our day.,Great experience - super special assistance
"March 16, 2020","A friend and I took our sons, both with autism, on a trip to London a few weeks ago and booked tickets for the London Eye. The queues were pretty long (although did appear to move quite swiftly) and the staff were super helpful in fast tracking us given the nature of our sons' conditions. The experience itself was great. Although the pod itself was pretty full, there was still enough room and space for everyone to move around and have a good view at any one time. A lovely time was had by all.",Spectacular views
"March 16, 2020","I was bought tickets for the London eye as a birthday gift, I was a bit apprehensive as I don’t like heights however it was a wonderful experience. As you are enclosed in the pod and if you didn’t want to stand by the glass there are seats in the middle.  However the views from the London eye are absolutely spectacular, London has a very diverse architecture, you get excellent views of the old city of London as well as all the new icon buildings. I really recommend this for visitors to London.",Review of London eye
"March 16, 2020",This is my first time on London eye and it's a great experience on London eye ride. Very busy place. Lots of tourist visit this place every day. The view from top of the London eye is awesome. You can see almost all London from the top. Very spacious that it can enter 10 people at one time. We enjoy very much. Nice place to visit.,Iconic landmark 
"March 15, 2020","Even though we didn't get to go on it, it was a part of our trip to London - seen from the bus, boat and when walking along the Thames, even from the Shard.  ",Great views
"March 15, 2020",Great views over London. Male sure you book your flight in advance. the exhibition in County Hall is also worth looking at,Mr

"March 12, 2020","Great experience, fabulous views over London.  We were extremely fortunate that there were no queues on the day that we visited.  Friendly and efficient staff - great gift shop 😊A definite when visiting London !",Amazing as always
"March 9, 2020","This was our second time on the eye and it was just as breath taking as the first.  Taking our three young children this time, they were mesmerised by the views of London.",Worth the price!
"March 9, 2020","This was an attraction my group debated, but ended up being very worth it! Allow about 45 minutes for wait and the ride. The views are gorgeous, especially at night!",Good butt
"March 9, 2020","The river cruise was great, good views, good commentary. The Eye was okayyy... The glass is so dirty, you're unable to get a good photo from the pods. It's okay, but I wouldn't do it again. In terms of the eye. ",Ferris wheel (London EYE)
"July 8, 2020","This Ferris wheel gives you an overwhelming experience through its capsules which take you up to great height likely above 100m and give you a landscape view of the whole city of London along with river THAMES.I got opportunity to visit in day time but someday will surely like to visit it during night...as its very fairly bright and twinkling.I think also one trip of single revolution took around 30/40 minutes ..You get to watch the 360 degree view of this most hyped place of England.There are benches in the center of the capsule as apart of seating.I had a clear view to see Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, The Tower and The Tower Bridge and the river Thames of course.There are so many souvenir shops around by ..It was worth it!",A visit to the ol country
"July 5, 2020",As you can see grandson was enamored .I am required to add more verbiage to make the cut.Was a good experience,Stunning views
"July 2, 2020","Really enjoyed the Eye, didn’t realise how tall it was, stunning views right across the capital. Had to queue a while to get tickets, but worth the wait. ",Great experience
"June 13, 2020",This is a really good experience for people of all ages.  You can get great views across the city and good to get your bearings if new to the city.,Seeing friends in London 
"June 7, 2020",Me and my girlfriend went on this lovely view. Good company. Would recommend to any body . Try it some time,Get tickets in advance
"June 5, 2020","Got my ticket in advance to avoid the line which I'd recommend. I went at night and felt that although it looked cool in person, I couldn't convey that via camera or phone. I would be interested in seeing it during the day to see if I could spot parts of London better. It's pricey and everything around it is extremely touristy but if you're walking around a lot, it's not a bad place to pause.",Worth It
"June 2, 2020","The tickets are expensive, but it's worth it for the great views. Even in the rain, we enjoyed ourselves!",Amazing Experience....
"May 28, 2020",I had ride at night. The view of London was breathtaking.  The fast track ticket is just reasonably priced. It's just worth purchasing since the queue is extremely long and you have to wait longer.,London Eye
"April 24, 2020","A gigantic landmark beside a beautiful river, it has a beautiful view on top, and it is suitable for all ages. A very peaceful place, beside a slightly busy street, sort of ironic in a way.",Nice day out
"April 20, 2020",London eye is a must visit place if in London with views to take your breath away the que was long but moved quick so with the river trip done first and the London dungeon left till last it was a great day out,Celebrating the 20th birthday
"March 8, 2020",This is a must sightseeing experience.  The views from the pods are amazing. We first went on when it opened so had to go on to celebrate 20years,Worth the eye - London Eye
"March 7, 2020",A must watch attraction when in LondonOn weekends its better to have FastTrack tickets to evade rush.,Thirty minute city view
"March 7, 2020",It is a touristy attraction offering a thirty minute view of the city.  I actually enjoyed the views and liked it to wrap up my London tour.,"Great view , long ride , NO TOILET"
"March 6, 2020","It's a must do experience when you visit London , you will get 360 panoramic view of the city and plenty of photos you can take , but the ride is a bit long and you will get bored , after 15 Min you will be done with all the photos you can take , you need to make sure to to toilet before you ride , as you will be stuck on the capsule for good 45 Min I think. I was showing off my bad dancing skills , I even tap danced myself somehow and moon walked out of the capsule when the ride was over",London Eye skip the line
"March 6, 2020",We are finding that our time is worth more than our travel money. So any time a skip the line option is available we take it. The London Eye is a fabulous way to see the London Skyline from a birds eye view. I recommend it as a must see for a first time London trip.  Took my 85 year old Mom and she loved it,Good sight seeing
"March 6, 2020","Lovely staff and well worth a visit,espescially on a clear day. Pods were clean and even though we had to Q, very good experiance",Views!!
"February 26, 2020",Amazing way to see the views of London. I have been on the eye a couple of times and it is a great way to see the city. I will confess the manners of those who you are riding with can make it break your experience.,Nice views but crowded
"February 26, 2020",Maybe I'm no fun but I just don't think it's worth it.  It's hard to get a good picture when you share the space with so many other people.  It's fairly slow as well.  it is of course a great way to get a view of the city but it just wasn't for me.,Fab attraction!!
"February 25, 2020","Absolutely amazing views. It was the first time for me and I’d definitely recommend to anyone going to London, so enjoyable and the staff were lovely!! ",Ludicrously expensive
"February 25, 2020","Great views, run very slickly, stupidly expensive for a 30min Ferris wheel. And more opportunities to part with your money with souvenirs, photos etc.",Underwhelming
"February 24, 2020","Our experience of the London Eye was entirely underwhelming.  In fact, it's kinda boring and an expensive waste of time.  If you want a great view of London, go to the bar at the new Shard building, near Tower Bridge.  Have a drink, take in the view, and forget the Eye.  I don't get all the hype about the Eye.  Didn't do much for me or my family.",What a View!
"February 24, 2020",This is not your carnival ferris wheel by any means.  This thing is huge.  The car holds many people (as many as 20?).  The structure goes so high that you see over everything in all directions.  It takes about an hour to go all the way around and is a pretty incredible experience.  We did the express pass which was totally worth it.  The crowd waiting was huge and the line was long.  The extra money made it palatable for the kids to wait.  When you get on you realize this is going to be a little different.  A little scary and exhilarating at the same time.  The views are amazing and the photo ops are too.  Totally recommend it.,Great experience!
"February 24, 2020","Great experience, wonderful views, even with a fear of heights, really delighted that I did it! Wonderful photo ops. ",Quite Expensive
"February 24, 2020","When on this purely for the views, they didn't disappoint but it's quite pricey for what you get. I only had myself to buy a ticket for and can imagine it be very expensive if you had a family.",Very smooth
"February 24, 2020","We arrived late afternoon to go up the London eye. We used our tesco Clubcard vouchers so got it for a third of the price. The gentlemen manning the self serve ticket stations was very helpful. All staff were cheery and the whole operation was very slick. I can imagine at peak times it would get very busy but we were there mid Feb and practically got straight on. It was a clear day and the sun set just as we got to the top, magical!!!",Long ques
"February 24, 2020",It was a lovely day. Very very long line to que in. It was moving but slow.  Apparently an excellent view up there according to friends who waited patiently while I went to other attractions within the area. Great experience. Tickets are pricey. ,A 360 view of London City from River Thames
"January 28, 2020",Recommended for all even for people who quite nervous about heights. You do not feel any shaking of the cabin at all. Be ready with your binoculars if you have one. Be ready at the end of the revolving cycles as there will a photo opportunity at the designated photo spot coloured with pink and faced the camera when instructed. Don't  forget to smile!,Fab
"January 26, 2020",Myself and 4 year old went on in the dark. Deffo worth it with a bogof voucher (£30 for us both). She did enjoy it but did play a bit with her toys in-between.,Birthday treat 
"January 26, 2020",Was a bit disappointed with the weather in the morning as it was a bit misty but by 11am when we arrived for our flight it had cleared a lotHad been on here 15 years ago & it didn’t disappoint us one bitClear views around & got some photos I didn’t get last timeMy wife enjoyed her birthday treat Well worth the money ,A mandatory experience in London !!
"January 23, 2020","One of the best views in UK and London , a mandatory experience for every first visitor , Thame river cruises and a huge high view experience",Stunning 
"January 22, 2020","Very nice view, a nice place to walk around with friends and family. If you visit it in winter don't  forget to bring a good jacket, is very windy around. ",Just a huge ferriswheel
"January 18, 2020",Find a good spot for a picture of this huge ferris wheel and move it on to know London...you good even ride on it ; we did not even check prices because it was in maintenance.Not much to say...,Relaxing
"January 18, 2020","Their staff would ask if it's a family tour , thereby they would place you to one cell. This made our tour more enjoyable. A sight for London when your at the top. ",Christmas suprise
"January 16, 2020",My husband treated me to new year in London and news years day on the eye. What a fabulous experience highly recommend slightly foggy on our day but still amazing views ,Overcrowded
"January 16, 2020","Most probably one of the highest and most amazing wheels in Europe. On a first eye looks stunning and then your desire to fly on is raising up rapidly. Unfortunately, there is a huge queue and with standard ticket in hand you need to wait a lot, so we had not enough time to give it a try. In any case the staff was really friendly and hopefully next we will manage to get on it.",Expensive but a worthwhile treat
"January 15, 2020","We visited at 10.30 am on a sunny, cold Sunday morning. The queue was virtually non-existent, we were greeted by friendly, jovial staff (particularly the security personnel). The ever changing views were impressive with excellent opportunities for photography. This is an attraction that should not be missed.",Very overpriced not THAT amazing but I guess a must do if in London
"February 3, 2020",If your a tourist I understand that you’re going to want to see this but it’s a bit overrated and extremely overpriced! I would recommend going to the ‘Sky Garden’ for good FREE views!,Thames cruise and London Eye
"February 2, 2020","Good price for this dual ticket so it was well worth advance booking. Staff were great, and we were provided with a funny and interesting commentary on the Thames trip. After purchase (during which you book the time for the cruise), you have to book a time & date for the London Eye. The instructions are to log in with a reference number. If you try and do this, the computer will say ""no"". I wasted an hour discovering that the reference in the documents provided consisted of numbers and letters, but the log in only requires the numbers, not the letters. Since the cruise is about 40 mins, you can book the Eye for about an hour and a quarter after the cruise departure time, and this should provide the two experiences seamlessly. Hope this helps.",Too slow 
"February 2, 2020",We visited the london eye this weekend on an evening flight. We enjoyed our flight and had a clear evening to see london. My daughter (8) felt that the flight could have been slightly faster. ,Well worth the money
"February 2, 2020","Unrivalled views across the whole of London a must for any tourist, Queues weren't too bad when we were there, so wasn't necessary to pay the extra for the Fast track tickets",A must do while in london
"February 2, 2020",Booked on line and printed ticket myself much quicker as saves you queuing. Very well organised i was booked in for 1pm but got there 2 noon they just let me on. Have to be quick but moves very slow then you hop on but staff are well trained to get you on and off.  Its approx 30 to 40 mins you are on. You get an amazing view of all round london. And i saw loads as was brexit day loads going on at Westminster. Watch out if you are crossing westminister bridge there where at least 8 packs of what i call pea men with there 3 cups trying to tempt you do not have a go you will loose your money and probably be pick pocketed at same time.,50th Birthday treat
"February 2, 2020","My husband took me on this VIP experience on my special birthday.  We had an evening 'flight'.  We went to the lounge upstairs and was given the choice of drinks, cocktails beers etc.  We had an introduction from our tour guide.  There were 8 people in our pod.  We skipped through the line, and the skip the line people, and entered our pod with our guide and her champagne trolly.  I cannot remember our guides name, sadly, but it was her first day on the job.  She did a great job pointing out the sites, we were given a glass of bubbly (soft drinks were available)  She asked if there was anyone on there for a special occasion,  and as it was my birthday everyone sung happy birthday to me. Our other guests were very friendly and the views from the pod was fab, really good to see it at night.  Had we had a daytime trip I don't think we would have seen much as the weather was poor.  All in all a fabulous experience.",Great to look at
"February 2, 2020","I’m afraid of heights, but wanted to go on the famous London Eye. You can buy fast tickets to advance the line. Unfortunately I chickened out! ",Great 
"January 30, 2020","I loved the experience, the place is great, you can see all of London from above, but the place is very crowded and the queue for tickets is very long, it is preferable to book from the internet to save time",A nice to spot for a brief view
"January 30, 2020","This site is a very nice spot to see the city center of London from above, the weather condition needs to be favourable to achieve a good view.",Great view
"January 29, 2020",It was a great attraction. This was definitely a lovely experience! Will recomended to do while you are here,Expensive but worth it
"January 12, 2020","I went with a Russian friend who was visiting London and purchased fast track tickets which were expensive but meant you could jump the long queue.  It was worth the expense not just for that reason but for the wonderful views of the iconic sites of London’s skyline, the Houses of Parliament and St Paul’s Cathedral. Even though the afternoon was dull we could see the views clearly and took lots of photographs all the way up to the top.  The London Eye also have a staff photographer at the entrance and automatic cameras to record you on the Eye which can be purchased at the end of the trip.",Not worth going if cloudy/foggy/rainy
"January 11, 2020","30 min ride, however note that at this time until 2021 it is not possible to see Big Ben as under construction. Best enjoyed at sunset with clear sky",unbelievable ride
"January 8, 2020",32 cabins for 32 districts..wow great idea. it gives a eagles eye view of the city. enjoyable ride with friends as every one has varying exclamation feelings,A Great Experience!
"January 8, 2020","My experience on the London eye is never going to be forgotten! The pod was fairly empty, we had a great view and overall great time. I would recommend a fast track ticket to skip the line. If you are in London you for sure have to go on the London Eye!","Amazing staff, fantastic views. What a fantastic experience"
"January 8, 2020","We pre-booked using our Merlin VIP Passes.So we got to the fast track 👣lane and had our photo 📷 done, then realised my son had forgotten his bag (in the chip shop). Staff member helped!!!! We got it back!!!!Was then taken to the capsule and enjoyed the views!!!!  This is a magnificent way to enjoy the skyline views and it was a clear day, so we could see literally so much!!!!Definitely worth a return visit",Beautiful London Eye
"January 7, 2020",Eventhough the queque are very long but it wothed with the view. We can see London city from the above. So pretty😍,Pretty view of London 
"January 6, 2020","Although it’s pricy, it’s a must do when in London!You get one roundtrip in the Eye, so you beter enjoy every moment you are in it!",Awesome sight 
"January 6, 2020",Enjoyed our trip to the London eye. Very picturesque especially at sunset! In the day we went the Christmas markets were on which was lovely. Lots of nice restaurants nearby to have a meal or even just a drink. ,A must do while in London
"January 6, 2020","Must do while in London. Not too cramped while was good, just have to put up with the Instagram photos which takes about 10 photos lolIt is a little expensive but well worth it.",Best Views of Big Ben
"January 5, 2020",We chose to use the skip the line option and it was definitely worth it. The day that we went it was very cold and standing in line would've have deferred use from going. Once we got on the London Eye it was such spectacular views of Big Ben and all of London. Highly recommend this attraction with the skip the line portion.,Very crowded but great energy
"December 28, 2019",We saw the queue and decided to skip the giant wheel. But it felt so good to see this whole sea of people around you. The lighting after dark brings in the festive mood. We loved the other rides - 80m high & the merry go round. My kids loved the whole day out. Thank you London!,River and Eye Combo
"December 28, 2019","Recently did the river and London Eye tour, and it was great. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and funny. The actual cruise takes about 40 minutes, and it goes by the Tower of London, City Hall, the oldest waterfront pub in London (the Anchor), among other landmarks. After the cruise, you can go straight to the London Eye. The line to get in the Eye is surprisingly fast (considering how many people are there). The ride takes about 30 minutes, and you get great views of London. I recommend the combination package if you are in London.",Nice to see but overrated
"December 26, 2019","It is nice to see just so you can say you were in London and saw it, but I think it is quite overrated, it is not historical or cultural heritage, and the queues to get on it are ridiculous, especially if you take the price into account as well. It does look good on the pictures though.",Awesome views. 
"December 26, 2019",A truly fantastic experience awaits with unbeatable views of central London and beyond; this probably explains why we have done this a dozen times! Recommended. ,Kid's delight to view the city from the Eye
"December 26, 2019","book in advance to get a shorter wait time. amazing view, grand daughter never wanted to get off of it. better than Disney World per her. ",SO GLAD we did it!
"December 25, 2019","We were only in London about 40 hours, and I'm so glad the London Eye was prioritized for us to do.  Great overview of the city!  Nice clear day and Fast Trax is the way to go!",London eye 
"December 25, 2019",Very beautiful and magical view and you can see London from different sides and enjoy your time there. ,East family activity to see a Fun view of the city
"December 25, 2019",We went with 3 generations Grandparents to grandkids and everyone really enjoyed it.  It was lovely  to see the whole city from up high and it went slow enough that we really had a chance to take it all in.  Also some fun photo ops.,Arrive early to get on board quickly
"December 25, 2019","This is a pricey tourist attraction and has long lines starting mid morning, but I suppose it's worth it to do once.  I would not take the time if you are only in London for a day or two though.  On the other hand you do get great views of London for photos.  So it's really a personal choice.  We were glad we did it but looking back on our trip we would not have missed it had we skipped it.",One time was enough
"December 24, 2019","I always wanted to go up in the London eye, so I made sure to add it to the itinerary when planning my London trip. I purchased the fast track ticket and highly recommend this. The views were great and I’m glad I experienced the London eye, but it’s definitely something you only need to do once. The next time I go to London I don’t need to go up in the eye again. The only reason I marked the London eye down was because my sister and I missed our initial time to use our ticket. We were over in Greenwich at the Royal Observatory and our water Taxi got us to the Eye late. We missed the opening hours by 5 minutes and we were told we couldn’t board any longer. I explained that we couldn’t go the next day because we had arrangements to go out of the city to Bath. The employee told us to comeback whenever we could to exchange the ticket and to tell them our story of why we missed our date. We ended up returning two days later and had to go inside to the ticket sales counter and exchange for a new ticket. It cost £5 each to exchange which I guess is better than having to pay full price again, but I mean it would have been nice to not have to pay. ",Amazing ride with excellent tour guide
"December 18, 2019",Ben was great & very entertaining. Will definitely recommend this ride. We shall come back in our next trip to London!,Worth the trip
"December 17, 2019",Well worth a visit to get a different perspective on the London skyline.  Quite expensive on a normal ticket so use a discounted ticket if possible.  We used the travel to London by train discount.  Enjoyable attraction.,Absolutely Beautiful
"December 17, 2019",it was a lovely experience and watchin.London from a Giant Wheel moving slow :) the timing was well maintained and the entire process was organised well with no mess and overall it was a neat !,Nice experience’
"December 17, 2019","This was a nice experience but make sure you do it on a day where it’s not rainy! Everybody should try this once!Price is ok, queue can sometimes be long, depends on day and time of the year. ","Lovely, but pricey"
"December 17, 2019","It's a lovely view and it is slow enough that you really do get to see everything around that area. It was a clear day when we started so we were able to see a lot, but by the time we hit the top it had started raining pretty hard which makes picture taking difficult but by then I didn't mind. Not sure we would have done it if it was raining or really foggy when we got there. I thought the price was a bit much, but it's a landmark at this point so we went.",Amazing experience
"December 17, 2019",amazing experience ... if you are in love with London this will top it off and your experience would be amazing.,Absolutely worth it
"December 17, 2019",My friends and I visited London to celebrate a birthday. The Eye was one of the highlights of this quick weekend trip. We did the Champagne Experience and it happened to be a slow night which meant we had a capsule entirely to ourselves. Apparently that doesn't happen often.I want to take a moment to give a quick shout out to Sam who served us champagne as we looked out over the skyline. She was really great about giving us information about what we were looking at and even gave us a taste of her experiences being an expat in London. If you ever read this thanks so much Sam! You really helped make our night. The Champagne Experience was totally worth paying extra for and the champagne was good stuff. I'm very happy we went and it was the perfect kickoff for our evening.,Amazing Views
"December 16, 2019",Amazing views and a great experience to see London from above. Staff were all friendly and super helpful. Would advise buying tickets in advance to avoid more cost on the day.,Great views
"December 16, 2019","We spent a nice afternoon cruising on the Thames, then getting the bird-eye-view on the EYE. Very nice, and worth the tour. We also got to watch the river rescue in action; someone fell into the river next to the Eye.",one of top attractions  in London
"December 16, 2019","This has been my 3rd time in London but first time to do the London Eye.We bought the online fast track ticket ,  though November was not a busy month.If you want to see good views of the Thames and some parts of London  then you must this.",Christmas treat

"December 31, 2019",One of the most famous place must be visited while visiting London city.Amazing location with great atmosphere,Bird’s Eye View of London
"December 31, 2019","This is really a nice experience. Due to the slow rotation of the wheel, you don’t even feel like you are moving. I hope that people who don’t like heights take a chance on this and get to see London from such a great perspective.","Stunning view, great experience"
"December 31, 2019","London is very eclectic. It have a fusion of the antique with the modern that is impressive. In one side of Thames River, the Big Ben (now in refurbish). In the other side, the London Eye. And you continue with Castles and Palaces in front of modern arquitecture buildings. The London Eye is becoming step by step like a symbol, an icon of UK as the Big Ben is. But it deserves it. Is an impressive structure that almost dominates the skyline of London. This one is a must if going to London.",Great
"December 31, 2019",Get the flexi fast pass. You just go around once. My girls loved it. Ended up at sunset so it was beautiful. ,Get in early!
"December 30, 2019",We originally booked to go on the Eye around 12:15 but when we went past at 9:30 am there was no line up and the rotation had begun. The lovely customer service people said we could go on early and we were very appreciative. A hint would be to go first thing in the morning as the crowds start building from 11 am,Eye on London
"December 29, 2019",Wonderful 360 degree view of London with one ride. Moderate wait times with optional express lines with additional cost. Awesome view of Thames. Worth the money.,Beautiful view of London from Thames river
"December 29, 2019","If you buy the tickets on internet you only have to wait around 30 minutes to get in, the queue moves very fast. It’s worth the experience. The view of London from above is very beautiful. ",A Truly an Eye of London
"December 29, 2019","If you're visiting London, this is one of the most recommend things to do, bit pricey but you don't want to miss this experience to see surroundings, buy tickets together with Madame Tussauds and others to avail some discounts.",Beautiful view
"December 28, 2019",This gave a beautiful view of London. We ended up getting the fast past and waited about 20 minutes to get on. I can’t imagine the wait for the regular line. I have a fear of heights but was easily able to sit in the middle to enjoy the views without having to look down. Definitely would recommend. ,I recommend it for you 
"December 3, 2019","I visit London often, but this my first time to be in the London eye and it was a great acceptable waiting time and good staff. ",Brilliant view of the city
"December 2, 2019",We rode once during the day and once at night so we could take in the views with and without the city lights.  The views are amazing up and down the Thames.  My only complaint would be that the allow too many people into each carriage which makes it difficult for everyone to see all the views - especially if you are short like I am.  But I would definitely recommend the ride - both day and night.,Great experience but now too expensive
"December 2, 2019","This is on the must do list for most visitors, but now that the price has multiplied over the years I'm not sure it's worth it anymore for an experience less than an hour.  If the Sky Garden is open I've heard it's as good or better.  ",Wonderful 
"December 2, 2019","Wonderful experience, not a very big que at 10am so was on the ride within 10 minutes. Staff were all friendly, ",There are other cheaper ways to see the city from up high
"December 1, 2019","We did this because one of the children insisted this was a bucket list item. It’s a novelty, a giant slow Ferris wheel that takes thirty minutes to do a full rotation giving you ample time to enjoy the view. I agree with another reviewer who suggested some audio in each capsule to tell you what you’re looking at. The views are pretty amazing, especially near sunset, however, you can go to the sky garden for free and see a view of the city from up high and save yourself $50 per person for a fast track ticket. In my opinion, this wasn’t worth the cost and we wouldn’t do it again.",A must do London experience
"December 1, 2019","Absolutely love this, and have done it multiple times with visiting friends and family. A great way to see London from above",Nice experience

"December 1, 2019","Great way to see the landmarks of London from an elevated position. The pods are clean, air conditioned and well maintained. It’s easy to move around within the pods and bench seating is available if required. The best time to visit is as the sun is setting and London starts to light up.",A wonderful place to ride on and it moves quite slowly.

"December 1, 2019","It was amazing. The views were outstanding. The queue was pretty long so I advise getting there early. When you get in, it is amazing. The session is around half an hour and once you get to the top, your phone is out taking tonnes of pictures. I recommend this as a trip maybe not with very young children. 8+ is a good age.I hope you visit and have fun!",Night visit
"December 7, 2019","Git late tickets so we could view the lights, well worth it.  We had a clear night and thoroughly enjoyed it",Very average

"December 6, 2019","Easy to redeem this voucher. Go to the white building, fast track queue to exchange for a physical ticket. The counter was kind to suggest an afternoon/evening slot where there may be lesser fog compared to the 10am (time of redeeming). He was right! No fog at 2pm. Queue was fast for fast entry, simple body and bag check and good to go!",A big eye
"December 5, 2019",A great way to view all the top buildings of London It’s amazing though it was raining but it didn’t dampen our spirits,Work team Christmas party

"December 5, 2019","The location is very nice, close to the big Ben and the parliament. The view is fantastic. The duration is just right.The price is quite high though...",London Eye Top!
"December 4, 2019",Its a must if you go to visit London and you want to have a sky look over the city and the river. I really suggest to buy the ticket via web in orser to skyp the line. The best time is the sunset.. they provid also vip package.,Great views of london... on a clear day
"December 3, 2019","Great views of london, however we went at dusk on a cloudly day and it left you a little disappointed. I would go again either earlier in the day or at dark so you can see the lights of london.",50 pounds pp
"December 15, 2019",The place is beautiful but don't pay such a crazy amount to have a ride! Spend those money to have a great drink with your friends in one of the many bars and restaurants close to it and with an amazing view,Great ride
"December 15, 2019","The experience and views are well worth the ticket price. I do recommend getting the fast track option, saves a lot of time. ",Awesome view
"December 12, 2019","It is one of prime attractions in London! We were fortunate enough because we went during off peak season and the waiting queues were not long. Comes with a nice complimentary 4D short movie experience!! The view from the top was pretty amazing except that it was raining , so far off structures were covered in haze. Nevertheless, enjoyed a lot!",Magic

"December 10, 2019","I bought my fast track tickets as I was not in the mood to wait in the que. The ride was awesome, you did not know you were moving. Once on top the view is great, you can see so far.",Absolutey fabulous
"December 10, 2019",Fast track ticket was a hit. We literaly just walked in. Ride was awsome. U really do not have a feeling that u r spinning. View  is remarcable. Definitely u have to do it but after u ve seen the city around and than go up to admire those sightseens!,Amazing Experience 
"December 9, 2019",This was certainly an amazing experience watching entire London from the top. ... this is must visit and a life time experience. ,Το London Eye
"December 9, 2019",Το London Eye is the best way to see the entire London from above and also in a very cheap way!!!!!!,My son loved it
"December 9, 2019","First time with 5 month old, 4 and 6 year olds and they loved it. We were lucky and didn't have to queue but the staff were pretty stroppy about the pram which was the only down side.  We have Merlin passes so I can't comment on value for money but the views are amazing and the ride just long enough to not get bored.  We had a fab time ",Amazing view
"December 8, 2019",Great view of the whole city. I went there at sunset and it really was magical seeing all the lights around.,Excellent
"November 25, 2019",We selected the champagne option. We had a host. It was amazing the views and interactions. There is sitting inside the capsules.,Worth the wait
"November 25, 2019","If the queues are busy, I recommend a fast track ticket. Sure, you pay for it, but it was so worth it. Cut my wait time in half and I could get on my with enjoying my day. You can get lucky or unluckily with the weather in London, so it's best not to schedule and just go on the day with the clearest skies. You'll see why once you get to the top and have this beautiful expansive view down the river and over London. I have been on a few of these 'wheel' things around the world and this is by far the best, purely on where it is located and the view you get of the city. Plus, the rotation is at a nice slow speed so you get a chance for plenty of photographs, but also time to just soak it all in. ",The kids loved it
"November 24, 2019",On a trip to London had to go on the London Eye. The children had a lovely time! It was a little foggy so could not see everything as clearly as we would have liked yet still enjoyed the experience. The queue wasn’t too bad considering a Sunday! ,London's View....
"November 24, 2019","You can see London and how beautiful the city is with the river and all the bridges... it is a great location... if you can.. buy the ""fast-track""... I think it's a 5 euros extra... you'll be first in line...",A must do

"November 20, 2019",It’s an exhilarating experience. An activity one must mist at London. One gets to see the full city. It’s is vey big an Engineering marvel in itself.,Great once 
"November 19, 2019","Although it’s a tourist trap, it is a must do. We waited until the day of to do tickets because we wanted to see what the weather would be like - and if it’s not busy you don’t need the fast track pass ",Amazing experience
"November 19, 2019",Beautiful view of the city and Westminister. The Eye is one of London symbols so you have to try it. Recomended !,Great view - not much else
"November 18, 2019","The Eye is well located, next to the Thames and across the river from Big Ben - easily accessed by the Underground. That being said it is far too expensive for a slow ride that  all it offers is the view.",Amazing view of London

"October 29, 2019",We took a spin on the Eye on our first day in London.  We lucked out with no rain and only partly cloudy weather.  We thought it was great to get a sense for how the city is laid out. Views were fantastic. ,A fun way to see the city.
"October 29, 2019",We enjoyed the London Eye and the views it afforded all.  You can stand or sit in the middle as it goes around.  We didn't realize we were near the end of the day so wish we had gone earlier as there is a cool park there as well.  There were many people waiting to get on but the employees kept the line moving quickly.,Excellent views
"October 29, 2019",Booked tickets with the 2 for 1 via train ticket. Waiting about 20 minutes in total for the attraction. Once of there were excellent views.  Great for all ages. ,Views
"October 29, 2019","The views here are amazing, it gives you such a great feel for London. We rode the eye our first day in London and so glad we did. I purchased my tickets on line, glad I did. There is a fast track ticket option as well, since we went in low season I did not pay extra for that. Glad I didn't as we got on very quickly. We went on a rainy day, but still had amazing views of the Thames and the rest of London. I know this is a touristy thing to do, but you won't be sorry in my opinion if you opt to be a tourist for a day!",Citywide View of London-Pefect for Families and Children
"October 29, 2019","I wouldn't neccessarily choose to do the London Eye on my own but my 10 year old and 8 year old really wanted to go.  The perfect mix of amusement park and an aerial view of London that made my children say wow.  Definitely buy tickets in advance as that will help with cutting back on time waiting in line-particularly in inclimate weather, and you can plan your day and what you see around going on the London Eye.  Total time on the London Eye was about 30 minutes.",Great views
"October 29, 2019",This is an amazing attraction. Do not be worried about the long lines. Pay extra 10# and get fast pass to the head of the line. We were on the ride in 3-4 minuets. The ride last 1/2 hour and continues to move. About 20 per car makes lines go faster. Buy tickets on line to save time. Their wa# plenty of time for photos and you can hardly feel the ride moving. ,"Great view on a nice, sunny day"
"October 29, 2019",The fast track option was definitely worth the additional £10. Great view all around! The only thing that I found disappointing is that I did miss a bit of audio when I was up there so it would have been a bit easier to pinpoint all the sights. A bit more crowd and queue management wouldn't hurt either!,Amazing!
"October 28, 2019",We had standard tickets for the London eye and joined the queue on arrival. Amazingly the queue kept moving and we were in the pod within 20 minutes. We thought this was great because it was a very busy Saturday afternoon! If you can spare the time don’t bother with the fast track! The ride lasted around 30 minutes. The only reason I did not give the maximum score was due to the young staff using a mirror to inspect under the seats for any left ’packages’ between customers alighting and boarding. They were not looking at their mirrors and just chatting. maybe just going through the motions?The river cruise was great and very informative thanks to our guide Rupy. Don’t forget the included 4D cinema experience. It only takes 10 mins but is absolutely fantastic. We hope you like having your photo taken because you will have it done a couple of times whilst your there. The best ones are as you go into the 4D cinema where when you come out you can get a nice souvenir book with your photo in starting at £20. We bought one and it’s a nice reminder of a great attraction.,Stands Talll over the City
"October 8, 2019",This modern structure towers high over the city of London with its castles and gardens as a symbol of today.  Seeing it in person really brings alive all that it represents.,Trip with friend 
"October 8, 2019","Have to say I was disappointed with the 30 min London Eye ride. We were on a limited time scale before going to the theatre so paid for fast track tickets at £37 each rather than £27 for routine ticket. There is nothing  to help you identify the building/skyline you are looking at from the eye. Would have got so much more out of the trip if you could have audio info helping to identify landmarks. So even for a fairly local person I really didn't know what I was looking at apart from Buckingham palace,  shard,  houses of parliament,  st pauls etc. So tourists must be completely list! I found out afterwards there is an app you can download which may assist with this Definitely wasn't worth £37 and not even worth £27!!",Worth it
"October 8, 2019","Even with my horror, the trip was definitely to recommend. The weather was not the best and all the construction clearly destroys a little. The pictures are a bit expensive, and you have little time to settle before suddenly being photographed",This thing goes high.
"October 8, 2019",It didn't take long to get on to the eye and the 30 minutes you spend going around are well worth it.  It gives you an excellent view of the city of London.  I got a little vertigo at the top but I felt safe the whole time.,Amazing!
"October 8, 2019",After coming to London a couple of times every year we finally decided to go on the London Eye and what an amazing experience it was. We had the standard tickets (bought with Tesco clubcard points) for which the queue was huge but to be fair it moved quickly and we were on within 30 minutes. The views are incredible  especially when you reach the top. Well worth the wait in the queue.,Fairly dull
"October 7, 2019","Hard to believe this is a # 1 attraction in London.   There is so very little to it--take a slow elevator (essentially) to the top of a ferris wheel and go back down very slowly.London is not a particularly beautiful city and, with its almost consistently overcast days, the view is insipid.",Great views over London
"October 7, 2019","We traveled off season so could plan and buy a ticket on the best weather day. Capsules move slowly and not many passengers are allocated per capsule, so you can move around freely and take great photos!",Awesome view of the city!!
"October 7, 2019","Lovely! Lovely!! Thank God I got the fast track ticket and didn't have to stay on the long queue, cause it rained that day. You get such a lovely of the city, perfect for photos. The 4D cinema was also very cool...overall a great experience and would recommend it to visitors. ",Lovely way to see london 
"October 6, 2019",Took some friends from abroad around London. Booked the eye as part of a package with city river cruise. We went in September when kids were back to school so it wasn’t busy. It was around 12:30pm when we got to the eye and it was pretty quiet and there was hardly any queue.My friends enjoyed the experience and it’s a great was to see London. ,They Closed Before we Had a Chance to Ride
"October 6, 2019","We arrived at the Eye a couple of minutes after 6. My husband and my self along with dozens of other people with tickets in hand were turned away. Waste of money, waste of time. We ordered our tickets in advance and it was stated on their website that they closed at 8 not 6.",Fantastic view of London
"October 27, 2019","We realized how beautiful the view could be on a clear, sunny morning.  Surely, the view at dusk would also be very attractive. Great photo opportunity for the city, Westminster buildings  and Thames from up above the skyline.  ",A must see
"October 25, 2019",Very iconic site that must be seen for anybody visiting London. Make sure you catch it on a sunny day. The boarding cue takes about 30 minutes so be aware. The ride is pleasant but seating space is limited. The views are nice but not impressive.,Not with the money
"October 25, 2019","Way to expensive, 2 adults and a 6 year old cost £83 then that still ask for donations. Going round on a big wheel shouldn’t be this expensive, don’t waste ur money",Gr8 views

"October 24, 2019",I can’t say enough abt this.  It was amazing.  I would looooooove to visit at night.  The ride and the workers were great,Amazing view

"October 22, 2019","It is a remarkable piece of machinery. It seldom stops and you just walk in and out of the hubs while it is on the move. The glass might be a little cleaner, but overall very nice. The only annoying thing was how much they tried to sell you pictures and other accessories. But then again. It is Coca Cola.",London Eye at night!
"October 21, 2019","We did this through Tesco vouchers saving us approx £50!We booked for a Saturday evening, it was fantastic. We arrived 30mins before our time (as advised )there was hardly anyone queuing, fast track people were not on any quicker than us! Bag searched, tickets scanned, we were in a pod 20 mins before our allocated time.Pods normally hold about 20 people, there was about 8 in ours so we had loads of room to move around.What a great view, so much better at night it was quite magical! Would definitely recommend this",Eyeing the city 
"October 21, 2019",Went on a tour with my older Brother’s and we were dropped off at the London eye. This was part of our trip so why not finish it over looking some of the beautiful sites. It took 45 minutes to go completely around and you could take some nice pictures. This is pretty good for all ages! ,Not the easiest ticket to ride!!
"October 12, 2019","Booked for 3 of us on the London Eye today. We had a visitor from Australia with us so wanted to impress. The journey in the pod was good once you were on the eye. Getting  onto it is another matter! I booked their standard tickets with a known boarding time of 15.30. We arrived early and realised that the time you are allocated is meaningless when it’s busy. (It was busy!). You just have to join the back of the queue and snake around for 45 minutes before you reach the front.  So if you plan to go on this ride, book a fast track ticket which costs more and lets you jump the queue. Otherwise be prepared to wait and wait and wait!.....",Greta Sunset Ride
"October 12, 2019","We arrived in London late in the day on a Saturday.  We were staying at the nearby Park Plaza (walking distance).  We wanted to ride the Eye, but couldn't be certain our flight would arrive at the scheduled time.  So we splurged in advance and bought Flexi Fast Track tickets online.  These tickets allow you to get in the Fast Track queue at any time during the designated day.  Shortly after we settled in at our hotel, we went out to eat confident that our place in the queue was waiting for us.  When we arrived at the Eye, the queues to buy tickets and to board with standard admission were very long.  However, the Fast Track queue was minuscule by comparison.  We waited maybe 10 minutes. What a great ride.  The sky was clear, and the setting sun was beautiful.  The views in every direction were fabulous.  We were glad we extra for Flexi.",SKY HIGH
"October 12, 2019",This is a wonderful ride lasting about one half hour.  You see epic views of London.  Hop on hop off as the wheel turns.  You need to do this.,Good view
"October 11, 2019",Cant use london pass which was very sad;( overall good experience and great view. You can see all most popular London sights. Line wasnt too long and i got in pretty fast.,Great view!
"October 10, 2019",I purchased the standard ticket online and upgraded for £10 in person.  I was through the line in less than 5 minutes.  The eye moved slowly and made it appear as you never left the ground.   This gave ample time to view all the sights in all directions.   It gave me a great perspective of how big the builds are and how close things really are. I would recommend it,Tourist trip
"October 10, 2019","Just a must do, any family from abroad, see all the landmarks in one go! The 4D is a fun thing so make sure you visit that as its part of the ticket. ",Nice to visit
"October 9, 2019","I felt that it wasn't as exciting as everyone makes it out to be. Only my opinion mind you. It was nice and a great view. Good to do once. I wouldn't do it again. It was part of a tour, but a bit pricey to do on your own. Getting off this was a bit tricky as the floor still moves, although very slowly, it still moves and I was not warned a head of time. ",London eye
"October 9, 2019","We prebooked standard tickets through a deal to get a discount, this included the 4D experience which is a short film and photo opportunity and we enjoyed it. The ticket said to be in queue half hour before the allotted time and it did take a bit longer to get through but it went down quite quickly really. The experience is good, the views nice and the pods large enough that you can walk to each side for different views. It moves slow enough that you almost don't know it's moving.",Wonderful views
"October 9, 2019",Great views of the city - bring out the camera!One thing if you get the champagne experience make sure you check the hours.  We had access to the bar for champagne but when we got up there immediately after the London Eye and were told they were closed despite it being full and someone had gotten served immediately in front of us.,Brilliant
"October 9, 2019",We didn’t know what we were going to do today but caught river catamaran cruise to the London eye purchased out tickets and went on board. It takes approximately 30 mins to do the complete circle. We had a 360 degree view of London it was amazing to be able to see the city like that. Being the first time ever in London it was a treat to see it and it wasn’t raining that was good. When we got off we went in and saw the 4D presentation of the eye and enjoyed that as well.,Not bad
"October 6, 2019",Yer it is what it is nice relaxing final they don’t overload the pods. But just watch out for the pics that other people take most of them just jam a phone in your face even if your right at the window,Have To Do This Once!
"October 6, 2019","So we stayed in London for a few days around New Year's Eve this last year. Of course we had to see the London Eye! Bought my tickets online the day before. The FastPass option seemed like a good one because we had seen the lines the day before, and it turned out to be a great idea. Walked past hundreds of folks waiting in line. Couple things to know: The cars don't stop moving (well, rarely they stop but only if a wheelchair or special access person is loading). They're spacious enough to hold 20-some people and not feel crowded. There's a BIG bench right in the middle in case you don't like heights - you can sit there and feel totally safe and not have to stand up. My wife doesn't like heights, but stood up for a while. You can see everything from the bench though for the most part. At some point it'll have you stand in a certain spot to take pictures. Like any attraction, you can claim/purchase that picture down in the gift shop later. The gift shop is crowded as hell, but the picture is worth it. You're there; spend the money.",Definitely worth it for the views!!!
"October 5, 2019",The views up there are so worth it!!! The fast track is worth buying instead of standard because if you get normal it is a queue for 30 - 40m wait or fast track for 10 - 15m wait. I would recommend this as a one time thing for tourists!!!,❤️ to London
"October 5, 2019","I think, I left my heart just right here. A perfect spot to capture the best memory while in London :)",Fab!
"October 5, 2019",This is a very fun experience and the views of London were fantastic. We booked fast track tickets to avoid the queues and we walked straight on at our allocated time. The standard ticket queues looked quite long. We also went to the top of the shard and have to say that the London eye was a far better experience in my opinion! ,"Liked it ok, one time is sufficient"
"October 5, 2019","This was a good way to get an overview of London and the surrounding area. We went on a partly cloudy day. I can’t i,Aline it would be a good thing to do in the rain. We went around 4 pm the end of September and the sun was low and in our eyes. Also difficult to take photos as Westminster, Big Ben etc. we’re in the direction of the low sun. I recommend morning time for the best light. Pretty costly.",REVIEW
"October 5, 2019",We had a great time worth doing. We unfortunately had an evacuation but that was handled exceptionally well. Our tour guide Lina was just amazing and did a great commentry.,Great beautiful site
"October 4, 2019",This is one of the best places to see it's a great way to view all of London.. other than the crowds and trying to navigate thru it it's a must see,People are rude!
"October 3, 2019","We would have enjoyed our experience, but for the people that were in the pod with us.  One couple walked around the pod pushing their way into the primo spot to take constant selfies for the entire ride!  With no consideration for the rest of us that we would like to look out the window at the sites, too!  The other problem was the CHILDREN. I felt like I was on a PLAYGROUND at RECESS!  By the time we reached the top of the ride, the kids had lost all patience and were running around screaming in the pod! I am not exaggerating, it was SO loud! The parents were oblivious to the kids' behavior and offered not discipline. Ruined the experience.","Great view,ok experience"
"October 3, 2019",We visited london eye but you get almost same view with sky garden or shard. The price is a bit high,Great views 
"October 3, 2019",We didn’t pre-book but pretty much walked on.  Queuing was minimal.  Views spectacular and not overcrowded in each pod. Works out at £1 per minute which isn’t cheap.  The 30 mins passed quickly.  I hate heights but at no point did I feel scared (though not keen on the getting on/off a moving pod!). ,What a view!
"October 3, 2019","The London eye was something we knew we would have to do. Two things had us abit worried though, the price and the wait.After finally getting around to doing it, we were happy with both.The tickets worked out to be 30 pound each, which we believe is fairly reasonable.I would recommend sticking with a standard ticket as opposed to the “fast track” tickets for an extra 10 pounds.We honestly found the wait for the tickets was longer than the wait to get onto the eye. In total, I would say we waited for no more than 20 minutes all up. After a quick ticket scan and a bag check you are in the line for the eye. Although normally these kind of security checkpoints are a tad annoying, it is calming to know that some checks are being done. Especially in today’s state.We shared a pod with about 8 other people, so if you aren’t a social butterfly who was hoping to get a pod to themselves, unfortunately that isn’t the case.There are plenty of opportunities to take photographs and the view is simply amazing, as you would expect being 135 meters in the air.As someone who is normally not a huge fan of heights, i found myself a tad anxious early on. However, as the eye ascended and the view kicked in, I found myself not even thinking about how high we were and simply enjoyed what it had to offer. The wheel stops everynow and again to allow people on, however they warn of this as to avoid any confusion in thinking the eye is malfunctioning. The eye has been standing for 19 years now and I think it is safe to say, it is pretty solid and isn’t blowing over anytime soon!There is a quick attempt at another cash grab at the end as they take a picture of you inside the pod. An attempt to up sell the picture to you at the end is the only thing that had us rolling our eyes.All in all, everything is worth it the moment you hit the top of the eye and see London in all its glory. What a view!","Coca-Cola London Eye,London,United Kingdom "
"October 3, 2019","One of the best places to be in London. Coca-Cola London Eye is one of the best landmarks in the world to say the least. London eye gives a very good and wonderful view of London.                 When u reach there u are also invited to see a beautiful show about the london eye which is included in your ticket.                      It also has other activities to do like cruise sitting besides the park etc as well as having food,drinks etc.A must visit place for most and highly recommended ",Nice views
"October 3, 2019","This experience is quite expensive for what it actually is. The views were definitely amazing, but your overall experience will depend on who you are in the “pod” with. There were about 10 people (give or take) in our pod, and unfortunately there were some very rude individuals who wanted to take over the best viewing/ photo spots in the pod for themselves for the whole ride. Very irritating. It was nice to get a chance to see London from this perspective though.",Good thing to enjoy
"October 3, 2019",If you are planning to visit use day out pass 2 for 1 and buy ticket at London eye.It is worth in that priceYou get 15min ride and can take view of whole London.Overall good experience shall recommendArea around it is also good.,the view from above
"October 2, 2019",the stunning view 360 degrees of London is the one of the better experiences of the visit. i have always wanted a skyview and the pictures were perfect.,Good Family Fun
"October 2, 2019","The Eye felt a bit cheesy to me at first but the rest of the family wanted to go and at the end, I changed my mind.  It's an amazing view of the city and sights from above (except for Tower Bridge that's around the corner out of view!)  Good photo ops and not as scary as you might fear in the totally enclosed cabs.   Lines move quickly.",Great attraction!
"October 2, 2019","I visited the London eye with my mum, daughter , auntie and cousin whilst visiting London for a function and decided to go on. The attraction was great we didnt have to que for very long and we were on, some great sights to be seen. Definitely worth a look away from the hustle and bustle of bustle london! Worth the money 😁👍",worth the trip
"October 2, 2019","one activity not to be missed when in London. the timing was perfect as the weather was cooperative. it is worth the additional fee since you get good service, no lines and the host tells you when to take pictures. lovely experience!",Gimmick and Waste of Money
"October 1, 2019",This was a waste of money and tourist trap.  The only good view is of Parliament and Elizabeth Tower/Big Ben (which is under construction at the moment).  No discount on tickets if you have a London Pass or other discount attraction card.  Take a picture of the London Eye from the outside and save your money.,The London Eye

"October 1, 2019",On Sunday I went to the London eye with my child we went on the special Timeout special biscuit decorating experience it was great fun we both got 2 biscuits each they tasted great and was very fun designing them and using the piping! The views where great we got on the capsule at our time slot no delays or quing was a great day. ,Great view
"October 1, 2019","Great view. We got the trip included with other attractions, and there was no line. So we got on right away. Was nice weather so all good ",Lots of ways to experience the London Eye
"September 30, 2019","We simply chose a standard ticket, but you can go more elaborate if you wish. It was fun to move around the pod and admire the views after a 3 D with glasses experience. It may be a bit of a tourist trap to go for the photos which we could not resist. I thought I might be queasy during the ride but was not at all. Buying tickets online might be a better bargain, but you can assess weather/visibility if you buy tickets at the time you are going.great panoramic views.",Totally worth the visit!
"September 30, 2019","London Eye offers a fantastic view of the city from a considerable height, Sea Life is a never boring classic for kids and Madame Tussauds has managed to be renewed from the historical wax statues only to become a proper fun show for all ages and a real highlight of the trip! All definitely recommended!",High eyes
"September 30, 2019","After visiting Buckingham palace we walked to London eyes . We have good rides and took nice pictures to surrounding  view . Mt wife and i have good experience of this ride . Smooth big space inside , you feel safe though you go high. U can stand and you can set if you want.Close by many attraction points one of them LondonTangent , same area as London Tangent",Expensive but nice place to visit 
"September 30, 2019","I have been to London eye few times, it’s a nice experience and really good view of London.We paid for photos but the camera operators are useless, they could not have included all of us in the photo, did not knew the length of the photo so not all part of my body in the photo.",Fun cruise
"September 30, 2019",The young lady giving commentary was very funny and amusing love her humour she  made us laugh while giving facts and pointing out sights.,Excellent
"September 29, 2019",Amazing views of our beautiful city. The staff were very efficient getting everyone on and off the pods also they weren’t too packed.,Stunning
"September 29, 2019","This lived up to our expectations. Memories to last us a lifetime. 🥰All the staff were fantastic. On the ball, friendly and even after rolling up with a small suitcase due to visiting before our hotel check in, they were friendly, fast and efficient through security. 10/10 🙌🏼 ",Fun but iberpriced
"September 25, 2019","Always book ahead, if you arrive late you won’t be let on.  The views are great and the service is reasonable... but if you have slow moving people in from of you it makes you anxious that you won’t get in/out in time.",Great view 
"September 25, 2019","Interesting experience considering that we experienced thunder and lightning at the top of the Eye.  Would have been better with clear weather, but still some great views.",Beautiful views 
"September 24, 2019",I know it's suck a tourist thing to do but I love the views. Going around 7pm is a great time. Just at sunset. ,A great view of London
"September 24, 2019","We'd booked online but joined the standard queue as we didn't pay the extra for fast track. Initially the queue looked quite lengthy but it moved well (they load up to 28 people in each capsule) and we were on within about 30 minutes.The pods have a reasonable amount of space so it is possible to move around. The movement is smooth and not at all scary - unless you are seriously scared of heights. Obviously the view does depend a little on the weather conditions, but on a good day you do get the opportunity to see most of the main London landmarks.Make sure you do the (free) 4D experience too - it is tucked away in the same building as the ticket office. It is not earth shattering, but it is a nice intro.Be warned though, this is a Merlin attraction so they will take your photos at various opportunities to sell to you later on. But they don't put any pressure on you and you can choose not to have your photo taken.",Daddy daughter day 6yrs old 
"September 24, 2019",This is definitely something you have to do when in london The 1st impression is wow it's a huge wheel and it looks scary and I'm not 1 for heights but when you get into the capsule type of cabin its class very safe and the funny part is and yes hard to believe its moving all the time the cabin doesn't move only the wheel which is class my 6yr daughter was very scared at 1st but after a few mins she was like me relaxed as u wouldn't know your moving ,Tim B
"September 23, 2019",My wife and I just did the London Eye a couple days ago. It has the most spectacular views of London. After walking around for 4 days seeing all the sights we went up in the London Eye and saw everything from up top it was so cool too see. You can move around and take all sorts of pictures. It is amazing how much you can see. You are also invited for free to watch a 4D movie about the London Eye. Very fun I highly recommend it if you are going to London don’t miss it. ,Can’t pick your fellow travellers on the capsule 
"September 23, 2019",Went on the London Eye with the family. It was Ok - nothing to get too excited over. We were in a capsule with rowdy German men who thought they were the only ones in the capsule. They hogged the prime viewing spots and were loud and making jokes amongst themselves. Was pleased when we were able to get off...,wonderful visit
"September 23, 2019","For a long time the family plans to visit  the London Eye, We did’t this time.It was a wonderful experience  very lovely scenery and on a Sunday it was not crowded and smooth walk in.The area around the Eye is full of entertainment and it i great for children.",Brilliant experience 
"September 23, 2019","Well organised, friendly cheerful staff and views to die for! Our trip was on an amazing clear sunny day which made it even better but definitely an experience not to be missed x",Coca-Cola London eye 
"September 22, 2019","It is always good place to visit , area is so happening , all age people can enjoy , london eye is good place to visit once if you are visiting london but not twice . If u r visiting first time . Must go place ",My London Eye Ride
"September 11, 2019","Being on the London Eye is really fun, but I was just wondering, why can’t there be some cafes around London Eye? The place looks so dull, apart from two very small cafes, there’s absolutely nothing to match this great landmark.",Gorgeous but pricey!
"September 11, 2019","Absolutely lovely, highly recommend going at sunset, but very expensive for such a short experience.",Spoilt by a few
"September 11, 2019","So, I think I can safely say it is a must do attraction. Although it is very expensive jury is out if it is worth it, on this occasion it wasnt.When we got on, we were obviously the least experienced riders on there as there was a huge hustle to get to the front of the pod.  We just calmly got on and stood patiently.  It set off 5 minutes later we were at a decent height with a few gasps and wows coming from the front. Could we see anything I hear you say. To our disappointment I have to say no unless of course you count looking at the phone with your arm stretched above your head above the window huggers!It was a total let down purely down to the selfishness of others.  Maybe of course they paid extra to stick to the window.London eye you charge enough, you need to manage this better. In fact the money I paid I think I own one of the pods now, maybe like a Spanish timeshare.  I will have to see when I am allowed to visit again as part of my ownership but this time I wont be letting others on.If you go, fight for the front, but when you have seen all you want please step aside for others!Dont forget the mortgage for the tickets!",Gorgeous views
"September 11, 2019","We have done the one in Singapore, but this was just as amazing with the views.Wasn’t too busy for line ups, depending on time, only waited 15mins. Can get it as a deal with 2 or 3 other attractions. Definitely worth it. ",Eye and cruise
"September 10, 2019",We had short window of time to do both but the ticket agent called the eye staff and they said the line was moving fast enough so we could do both.Each ride is worth the time.The eye takes about 10 to complete and on and off is easy.They can stop it if there is a person who moves more slowly.The river ride was very informative and you can walk back along the shore way to see up close various place.We went back to The Anchor for lunch and the Globe theater for pics. The distance took about 30',Amazing view at sunset 
"September 10, 2019",We booked out ticket as part of the buy 2 or 3 for a better price.  Well worth the saving.   Chose a time slot at sunset and hoped for the best and we ended up at the top of the wheel as the sun set.  Such a great view ,London must see’s!!
"September 10, 2019",Beautiful views of the city of london and river thames! We went in summer but before UK schools closed. We visited around 10 am on a weekday and it was not very crowded! If you have young children like mine aged 8 to 14 years its a must see! Anyone in a group scared of heights can still come along and try it...if they still can't stomach it they can sit in the middle of one of the cabins and just close their eyes! Afterwards saw sea of life and madame tussauds. The latter needs prebooking for specific time and it was so worth it!!,Such a fun experience
"September 10, 2019","Lovely calm quiet ride giving you exceptional views of London, Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, The Shard, Buckingham Palace, The Tower and obviously the Thames River to name a few. The ride runs very slowly so you can really take in all the views. We fast tracked the line so the wait wasn't bad at all. Maybe 5 minutes.",The view is amazing 
"September 10, 2019",I bought the ticket  with  5 attractions one of those was the eye.You can book a hour to comeThe ticket with that pass is much more chipper than if you buy it alone The ride is about 30 minutes total once you get on the weal,Loved the London Eye!
"September 10, 2019","We purchased tickets for about sunset and it was wonderful!  Very small line, walk up  and enter! It's a very smooth slow ride that gives you views that are amazing.Well worth doing while in London!",Beateful view of London
"September 17, 2019",I went to the London eye in the morning and the weather was good so i had the opportunity to see the city clearly from above and had a nice experience.,London eye 
"September 16, 2019",I recently visited London whilst on holidays soWe were doing all of the tourist things Seeing all of the attractions and monumentsThe London eye being one of themThis was a great way to have a look around while enjoying a bit of a break We didn’t have to line up for long and the capsule was quite roomy so not crowded The Eye is a little expensive But in my case I might only ever be there once so well worth the ride,Worth seeing
"September 15, 2019","Was a great experience, booked online with fast track and was worth it all the way through. Skip long queues and hassles. Finished off with glass of xhampagne in the bar on the 1st floor.",Amazing
"September 15, 2019","We opted for the fast track plus champagne. $14 more than the reg price.  We waited in a lovely bar/lounge area before boarding, only one other couple was in our pod along with a tour host.  She poured our glass of champagne and then when we reached the top point she explained all the landmarks around us and offered to take any pictures with our phones we wanted.  It was a very pleasant uncrowded half hour ride.  Well worth the extra money.",Fantastic!! 
"September 15, 2019","We were on a theatre break in London and decided to do some sightseeing. We were amazed by the sights on the London Eye. We booked our tickets on the website the night before which was incredibly simple. I was concerned with the length of the queue upon arrival but it was quick to go down and was constantly moving. We combined with the London Eye River Cruise. We paid £33pp which I felt was great value for money. It was a fabulous experience on the cruise. Jeannie was our commentary guide. She was very comical and made the trip very enjoyable yet informative. I would love to go on the London Eye again we were so lucky with the weather, we could see for miles and miles. ",Great experience
"September 15, 2019",Well organised tourist attraction. Great views. Good way to get an overview of some of the main London landmarks,Great view
"September 15, 2019",We took the last possible trip at 9:30 pm to see the London at night from the sky . Its beautiful and we took the fast lane to skip the crowd . Its on the expensive side - however worth the money.The commercial part of it - selling you photos before and after in the london eye sometime can be annoyong however its a ritual everywhere you go. Recommended visit for all - though its NOT cheap we enjoyed thoroughly,Anniversary trip 
"September 15, 2019","Great way to get a beautiful view of London, it runs til around 9:30 sunset photos would be amazing . Get the fast track ticket it’ll save you from the long lines .",Great view
"September 15, 2019","Best go on a clear day. We took lots of pictures. Shame Big Ben was covered with scaffolding though. If you have a disabled person in your party, you don’t have to spend hours in a queue. They take you fast track.",Beautiful 360 view
"September 15, 2019",Amazing view up there in a clear blue sky. Ground staffs are extremely friendly and helpful while the 4D experience is amazing,Great fun and beautiful views!
"September 9, 2019","This has been a bucket list item for quite some time.  It lived up to my expectations. Beautiful views of London -- and it was terrific to not have to wait in long lines, with the advance purchase of our tickets.",Wonderful view
"September 9, 2019",My teenage son and I are afraid of heights and we both managed to get up enough courage to go on it with my 5 year old and husband.  It has a great view of the city on the waterfront and even some on the horizon. I would do it again!!!,Nice for tourists! 
"September 9, 2019",The place are very clouded with tourists and you must be careful of the picked pockets but it is the place you should come if you come to U.K. for first time !,Amazing views
"September 9, 2019",Amazing views from the top of the London eye. Only downside was the length of the queue. We waited until half 8 in the evening and at that we queued for an hour but was worth the wait!,Annual vacation 
"September 9, 2019",We did not actually get on the ride. It is one of the largest of its kind in the world. It was a cool night and there was still a line of people waiting to get on. ,Nice
"September 8, 2019",Nice to be on the ride. I thought I had a skip the line ticket but I actually had a regular ticket. The regular line didn’t take long though. Very nice. ,Best view in town!
"September 7, 2019","My husband and I were looking forward to going on this attraction and weren't disappointed.  The views were incredible and could be seen from all angles.  You are free to walk around the pod and there are seats if you wish to sit down.  Even though you are in the pod for about half an hour in total, it seemed to go by a lot quicker.  I took  a lot of photos of all that I saw.  We visited London at a very busy time so there was a big queue.  However, it didn't take long for it to move and was worth the wait.",Cool - but not a necessity to do
"September 7, 2019","This was one of our first stops when in London. It is a cool ride and the views are very good. However, it is pricey and crowded. Low rating is due to the fact that they did NOT do a good cleaning the glass - the best view spots were dirty and scunggy. Since this ride is mostly about the views, that was disappointing.Would recommend the tickets that get you to the front of the line quicker - it’s worth it. ",Waste of time and money
"September 7, 2019","Sorry, I do not understand why people are willing to queue for a long time to get there. A waste of time and money, unless you go with a group of friends and have lunch or drink/ s on the way.",A MUST DO ATTRACTIONS
"September 7, 2019","Bought tickets online, was allowed to board at 10am vs our ticket time of 1030amThe green screen photos they take before you board were sloppy and upsetting they took them and everyone had green halos around them...would have been a great photo but they ruined that.the gift shop after you exit the ride was rude to many so we went next door.  also your ticket includes a FREE 4D movie experience that you can do before or after your ride.  located right across from the Eye itself.",Amazing view of the city
"September 3, 2019",Get the express!   well worth it  - the line for general admission was HUGE.  Gives you an amazing perspective on the city,"Good package, but London disappointing"
"September 3, 2019",Big Ben is under reconstruction. House of Parliament is not light up in the night as it used to be. London dungeons attraction and sight seeing bus were also in the package. Strange system of queueing up : you are pre-booking time for starting to queue at the beginning of queue at that time (?),I was skeptical but enjoyed it!
"September 3, 2019","I was not sure about visiting the Eye, I did not think it would be that exiting. But it turned out to be a very nice experience and the views of London are truly unparalleled. I purchased tickets on-line which made it very quick and easy to get thru the line and get on. I would recommend doing that. ",London Eye was so-so but river cruise was great!
"September 3, 2019","I would say the London Eye can be skipped if you want to save some cash. The wheel moved slowly so you are able to get a view of London but I don't think there is anything super spectacular about the London aerial view. If you have nothing else to do on a nice London day, I would say yes, go for it, but it would not be on the top of my list. As for the accompanying river cruise, it was actually very enjoyable. The guide, Drew, was warm and funny and was corny at times (which is expected for tour guides, right?) but he did provide a lot of information and stories about various London sights such as Parliament, Big Ben, Tower Bridge, London Bridge, the Shard, and other sights on the Thames. I would highly recommend this cruise on a nice day.",Nice ride but maybe skip 
"September 2, 2019","While the experience did offer a great view of the city it was in our opinion not worth the time spent. We did the fast track ticket and it was relatively easy, but could be better served with more information about your surroundings while you are up in the eye. ",London eye
"September 2, 2019","The London eye was an amazing experience made even better by the VIP status of the champagne experience. It’s a splurge, but worth it, as you get to wait in the lounge and order a drink until your host whisks you away. Out hostess, Nicole was also amazing!!!! Definitely would recommend doing this!",Fantastic
"September 2, 2019",We bought advanced tickets the day before visit and when we arrived we were on board in no time fantastic views air conditioned pod I would go again anytime.Not to be missed.,See London high above
"September 2, 2019","The fast track gets us much faster to the capsule and our private guide is knowledgeable. VIP lounge access provides comfort before getting onto the ride, however drinks cost extra.River cruise package is a nice way relaxing after a long day walk, we didn’t take the package since we bought river cruise separately.",Not Worth the Money
"September 2, 2019","Yes.  You great a great view of London, but it is pretty expensive for what is essentially a ferris wheel.  We did the advance tickets so we had a specific time to arrive (which did cost more), but we saved waiting in line for about 1 hour.If you want a leisurely ferris wheel view of the city that you will enjoy it, but if you are budget conscious, then you can find plenty of more interesting things to do in London with you money.",Great Views
"September 2, 2019",The London Eye is worth the time.  Just make sure you buys tickets in advance. With tickets in hand you bypass the lines which can be very long.,great ride
"September 2, 2019",stunning view of London. It was great visibility. The line up wasn't more than 20 minutes. Very cool experience.,Visit if you have extra time.
"September 1, 2019","Visited the London Eye middle of August-2019.   We went there just before 9 PM hoping to see London in the dark, but it got dark only after 9:30 PM and our ride was done by then.     Good thing about this ride in late evenings is that, the lines move really fast.  We had about 500+ people in front of us when we arrived at the bottom of ride around 8:30 but the line moved really fast and were inside the london eye capsule before 9:00 PM and done with the ride by 9:20 PM.  So the ride takes about 20 minutes.  Had a nice view of river Thames, Westminister Abbey and a few landmarks but nothing spectacular.  It is an okay ride.  Do it if you dont have anything else to do and visited all the more important landmarks or the Kids really want to do it.",Worth it!
"September 1, 2019",Buy the fast track ticket for this. We didn’t even wait at all. It was an usually warm and sunny day. Great for pics. It’s a 1/2 hour for one revolution. 25 people to a pod which still leaves enough room to move around and take pics. Definitely an attraction to take in while in London especially on a nice day. Plenty of eateries around for a quick bite. ,Nice to do but overpriced 
"September 1, 2019","Title says it all.I pre booked tickets, you still have to queue but it wasn't long before we were on.You get good views but it is overpriced for what you get.It's just a slow big wheel. But because it's on the list of things to do in London, people will visit and pay for the privilege of a 30min flight.",Not bad but nothing special either!
"September 1, 2019","For the last weekend of school holidays I would say we might have been fortunate with the queue, arrived at 11am and only had to wait for 15 minutes to board the capsule. Once inside and going round as it was a nice clear day the view was clear and got better the higher you climbed. If there was a gripe it was that the glass was quite dirty which did show when taking pictures. All in all it was a decent attraction at a slightly high price.One tip is not to order the binoculars as they really are naff and about as much use as a chocolate fire guard, certainly overpriced.",Expensive for what it is
"September 1, 2019","It's iconic so we had to do it but it was a let down and there are many other ways to get a view over London. We were there at a quiet time but were persuaded to select the more expensive ticket for the ""fast track"". That turned out to be unnecessary and I was sure we were in the wrong line but was assured we were not. The experience is underwhelming and the pod we were in looked as if the ""glass"" needed cleaning. Luckily we had no children in our group--I was dreading that possibility as we stood in line with squealing kids. Lining up on a hot day might prove unpleasant. All considered, we got in quickly but it was a big disappointment. If I'd had to wait for any time, I'd have been even more disappointed. I enjoyed the view from the top of St Paul's much more and even some of the bridges give great views of the city.",A dream come true
"September 1, 2019","the cue was long but it is worth the wait.Breath taking view, it was a very nice experience. looking forward to comeback soon. ♥",Great value and experience
"August 31, 2019",So glad we did both. Our guide on the boat trip was Mickey and he did a fabulous job.  Nice to see the major sights from a different viewpoint. We felt it was just the right length. Enjoyed the ride on the London Eye as well.,Great views of the river and city
"August 31, 2019","This was my first visit to London and felt that this was a must do. We were not disappointed. The line was not bad, it was a beautiful day and the views from the capsule where great. The capsule is quite spacious so you can walk around at your leisure, plus there is a very good size all-around bench in the middle if you prefer to sit. Glad we did it.",A mai. Attraction
"August 31, 2019","Though it was at a hot season,Seems that everything is operated smoothly. Lines were not so long and the views of London are very nice. Not recommended for a rainy day",Does not disappoint!
"August 31, 2019",Make this one of your top attractions. This is a staple in London- go during the day and when the sun is setting you will get some amazing photos! ,Amazing by night and day ! 
"August 31, 2019",I have experienced the London eye 3 times now and never disappointed ! Total different experience visiting during the day than on the the night both breathtaking views. Highly recommended to do while visiting London ! ,A Must in London
"August 31, 2019",I visited London on many occasions and this was my first time in the Eye. What an amazing experience!  The day was absolutely beautiful with sun and some fluffy clouds.   I purchased the Fast Track and I am glad I did.  First opening at 1000 and the lines were long. So worth the extra money. The pods were not crowded either in the morning ... I hear the afternoon they do pack 25 people per pod (be mindful).  Glad I did this little adventure and saw London from a different angle.  ,Worth paying extra
"August 31, 2019",Did not have to q for ages with my child in the August heat so worth every penny. Great way to see London. Enjoyed the 4D cinema however there should really be something marking how the eye was made museum or something !,Incredible view and way to see London
"August 31, 2019",Is such a great way to see London in comfort. While big queues they don't pack each of the pods and there is plenty of room to move around and get a good look 360degrees all over London,Family visit
"August 30, 2019",Get here early if you don’t have tickets. We arrived at 10 am & the queue was fine. 4 D cinema is ok. ,London Eye
"August 29, 2019",The wait on the line to get on the London Eye was about 30 minutes. The cruise provided a good scenic view and the tour guide was funny and made the cruise. Overall I was not impressed with London.,"Nice view, not a must activity"
"August 29, 2019","Very nice view of the city. Having said that, I don’t think it is a must activity for city visitors.",View over London
"August 29, 2019",I have been before so knew that with 2 young children it was important to get the fast track so no waiting. Others were in the queue for over 45 minutes. Excellent views of London from the Eye. I also added the River Trip as you get a discount.,Another tourist attraction
"August 28, 2019","I moved from England since this wheel opened in London and was interested in seeing it.  Just so you know - the locals call it ""the eye sore"" and it earns the nickname.  Totally ruining the skyline and architecture of stately, historic Thames side London, hordes of people and pricey as well.  True - you can see over all of London but not worth the queue and quid to ride it.",Interesting 
"August 18, 2019",As all major countries have. It does what it says on the tin.Amazing views. Might have a long wait until you get on it but the views are amazing. Worth a vist and a ride.Plus your on the South bank which is good walking. Loads to see plus loads of small restaurants and coffee and bars ,Beautiful 
"August 18, 2019",A must go activity... book ahead of time to avoid line. Once you are in indulge yourself in L8ndon scenery... amazing ,Fun Ride
"August 17, 2019","We got fast pass tickets for the London eye. It was the first thing we did when we got to London, we were able to see our surroundings, and get excited about what we would see next. I did think it was a bit expensive but we did enjoy it. If your in London it's good to do one time.",Have to do it once
"August 17, 2019","It’s expensive, but it’s an experience you should do once if you can afford it.  I was pleased to see that even at capacity I didn’t feel like I was too crammed in there.  Also, I felt like I wanted to grab what I thought was the best view before anybody else did, but don’t worry, people tend to move about the capsule and are generally accommodating If you’re snt to squeeze into a specific spot for a view and a selfie.  Go for the express pad so you can skip the long line, but don’t expect to walk right on there will still be a small line. It went fast though.  We enjoyed the views and marveling at the mechanics of it all.  The photo that they take is didn’t work for us which was disappointing but from what I saw of others, it’s not really worth worrying about anyway.",I'm On Top of The World!
"August 17, 2019","Wow! This is an amazing attraction! I loved being able to see the city from up there. If Big Ben wouldn't have been under construction, we could have taken the most beautiful picture of it from up there. It goes slowly enough that you can take pictures from all angles and yet take time to just enjoy the view. My son is afraid of heights so he sat in the the large seat in the middle until he felt brave enough to get close to the glass and take a few pictures. The only weird thing is that the wheel never stops. It loads and unloads passengers without stopping. The entrance/ exit is wide enough to allow all passengers to enter and leave the capsule just in time, but God forbid someone in your group stays behind, I don't know if they can press an emergency button. ??? Anyhow, I'm glad we went up there and enjoy the tallest ferris wheel in the world!",Cruise and London Eye Trip
"August 16, 2019","We did the cruise first, seeing lots of the sights of London and landed in time to go straight into the queue for the Eye. Still had to wait but it wasn't too bad. Only issue was when we got to the security point our grand daughter decided she needed the toilet. The staff couldn't have been nicer, we were allowed to leave the queue and were instructed to come back in the fast track entry as we had already waited, that was a very positive experience. Good view from the top and fortunately it was a pretty clear day so saw all the sights.",It's pretty good
"August 16, 2019",The fast track line is really fast and the view is amazing when you get to the top. At the top you can see almost everything we have amazing pictures,So fast track for tix
"August 16, 2019",It’s worth it as long as you buy your tix in advance. The lines were crazy long if you didn’t. Fun and easy tour to see the entire city. ,London Eye
"August 15, 2019","Honestly I found the eye a bit over rated. Yes, you get a lovely view of the city, but it's anti-climactic and even at the highest point, I wasn't all that thrilled. I think it is literally exacltly average. There is nothing great about the Eye, but also nothing bad. The wheel itself  moves very slowly which is fine, you get more of the experience, but at a certain point it started to feel like a drag. I went at around 8pm thinking that the sunset would be nice to see over London, but it really wasn't that great.  I do highly recommend getting the fast-track ticket, it worth the cost. .",Very over rated
"August 15, 2019",The London eye is just an over rated experience. It's not worth the time you spent in the queue to get to the cabins. Can be certainly missed. If you really want to see the view from the height then I would suggest you go to St. Paul cathedral and visit the viewing gallery. But remember it's about 500 steps but worth an experience. ,GREAT WAY TO SEE CITY ! 
"August 12, 2019",Went to a friends pre drink birthday party on the London Eye. It was a great event and it will be great for my 40th !! ,Family trip
"August 12, 2019","Eh, you read about the queues but it is horrible in real life. The view is fantastic but I think a little bit overhyped if you want something nicer go to sky garden. May be worth it if you buy the champagne package",Great but staff not helpful
"August 12, 2019",Def worth the experience but experience slightly spoiled but staff shouting at everyone to get off and on. Only 30 mins and queues do move quick so not worth spending the extra for faster queue passes. We had a sleeping baby in a pram that we were told had to come out and pram folded as needed space for a wheelchair that was clearly invisible and none to be seen. Staff really not helpful and all about speeding people on and off and got whole family of 6 in a panic when we tried to get on. They should check how many are in your party as family in front of us got split and they had to stop the wheel and bring it back. Disaster. Managed to get pram up and off the moving capsule fine coming off! Worth the sights and money.,Wonderful views
"August 11, 2019","This is our 3rd visit to the London Eye, we enjoy the views so much it’s always good fun. The ride is relaxing and you have plenty of opportunity to walk around the pod to admire the views and take photos.",London eye
"August 11, 2019",Fast pass was great! Very quick. Great views of the city. All kids and family members had fun from ages 11 to 75.,"""Earth has not anything to show more fair . . . . . """
"August 11, 2019","This quote from Wordsworth's poem on ""Westminster Bridge"" was posted on the sides of the approach as we queued. We'd been warned the queue moved exceeding slow, but were very pleasantly surprised that we didn't have to wait too long (about 20 minutes) to board, and the staff were fab, REALLY friendly (even the bag-checkers!).London is dirty and cramped and claustrophobic at ground level, but this was like the ""celestial city"" when we got to the top of the Eye - the mix of traditional architecture such as St Paul's and Parliament, and the modernistic features like the Shard were somehow beautiful and magical from this distance - we thought about how it must appear to aliens coming in from space!It's expensive - but we got a 2-for-1 deal with our train tickets (you can print a voucher, then have to show your train tickets with the voucher at the ticket office) - so worth it for a ""bucket list"" experience.AND you get a ""4D Cinema"" experience with your tickets, which was great fun.",Great Combo
"August 11, 2019","The river cruise is a great way to see the Thames river. It is approximately 45 minutes long. The tour guide was friendly and very knowledgeable of the landmarks along the river. The London Eye gives you great views of London and the Thames river. The line to get on is quite long, unless you get the fast track. Once you get in the capsule, the view is outstanding. The ride is approximately 30 minutes total.",Must See
"August 11, 2019","A must-do attraction if visiting London as a tourist.The views offered from the top are spectacular and provide some great photo opportunities. There are queues as you would expect, particularly during the summer months, but I found these moved fairly quickly and the wait was not too long.","Charged twice - misinformed by supervisors and managers, no refund"
"August 11, 2019","Purchased 2 Standard tickets for the attraction on the website in order to avoid queues. Whilst purchasing, the website crashed but my card was charged £60. Advised by outdoor staff to queue in the ticket office where somebody would be able to trace our tickets. Got to the desk, told we were in the wrong queue, had to queue up again at a separate customer service desk. Lady on the desk couldn’t trace our purchase, so called on a supervisor to help out - I’ve never known such rude service! She told us they hadn’t received any money from me so there is nothing they can do, even when I had the transaction in black and white on my banking app. Asked to speak to a manager, who came down and explained the situation in depth so that we understood where my money was, which we appreciated. However instead of offering us tickets told us we could purchase again for the standard price but he would add fast track. He told us that the original money would bounce as the company would not accept my payment, and if it didn’t do so by 5pm to contact their customer service. Paid another £60 for tickets (which luckily we had, others may not have budgeted for this), went on the Eye despite all the mishaps.4pm came, still no refund. 3 days later and I have now contacted customer services three times with no response. Now been informed by my bank that the London Eye have claimed the money (which we were assured would never happen) and I am now £120 down for a 15 minute wheel ride with awful customer service.This is now being disputed by my bank and I am hoping that this review will provoke a response from your company.",People in line are the best part!
"August 10, 2019","The London Eye in July means lines. We were in line with people from India, Nigeria, the US and UK. Talking with them was more interesting than any other part of the experience. For the money, a boat tour shows you much more of the layout of London, with less waiting.",A must do! 
"August 7, 2019","Booked tickets online for a time slot (12:30). we got there and was told that we just had to queue which was about an hour long. The time slots don’t really matter. We paid £10 to upgrade to a fasttrack slot which was at 3pm, but as my boyfriend bought his ticket a 1:45 slot became available so we changed. We could queue from 1:15 and we were up in the air by 1:30. I’d recommend buying the fastrack as it saves a lot of time. Well organised and it offers student tickets too! ",Fantastic views
"August 7, 2019","We had to queue for quite some time to get tickets, then queue again to actually get on the eye, but once we were on, the views were fantastic.",Magnificent views from the Eye
"August 7, 2019","Loved this ride. It was a nice slow pace, and the views of the Thames and London were spectacular. Our pod only had about 25 people in it, so not crowded. I have a huge fear of heights but that fear disappeared while we went on this. Highly recommend this!",Fabulous Thames River Cruise and London Eye
"August 7, 2019",The Thames River Cruise was full of sights and sounds. So relaxing going down the river and seeing all the beautiful buildings. It was a little hard to hear the guide but enjoyed it immensely. We then got off and went on the London Eye. I had no idea I would love this so much. What a great way to look all around London. Fantastic views and it takes about 30 minutes to make the full revolution so it hardly feels like you're moving. A must do when in London!!,Bought the fast track but couldn't pull it up on either of our phones
"August 7, 2019","The London Eye was a zoo. We bought the fast track to skip the massive lines but couldn't get the tickets to pull up on either phone so had to wait in a very slow moving line to get paper tickets. If you purchase, definitely print your tickets at the hotel. I was underwhelmed with the the slow moving ""eye"" and was ready to get off about halfway through. I think it was overpriced and overrated.",Overpriced
"August 7, 2019","It’s as simple as supply and demand - this is a popular attraction so they get to charge a lot to do it. Since we had a limited time in London and it was one of the few things my son wanted to do - I bought the skip the line tickets to save on time.  £70+ later we were on.  Half way up the line they took a picture of us that we had the option to purchase at the end of we liked. Your image is photographed with the background of Big Ben and Westminster Abby in the back and you can choose from £20 or £25 package (which includes key chain sized photos and 2 key chains to go with it).  Take your own - it’s not as perfect, but it’s more meaningful and memorable. The trip itself took just under 30 mins. While you do get to see a far distance in London (I feel the best views were of Westminster Abby, Big Ben (currently under restoration until 2021 BTW), and the River Thames. While I would do this again for half the price - I wouldn’t for what we paid. I certainly wouldn’t stand in the massive lines as it would not be worth the wait - keep in mind this was August and the city is bubbling with tourists.  I’d rather spend the wait time at The Tower of London (which I did last year) or somewhere else where you can experience some of the rich culture of the city.  So as I won’t pay to skip the lines and I won’t wait in the long lines it is safe to say I won’t do this one again.",Not worth it
"August 7, 2019","The London Eye is obviously a popular landmark for tourists and the experience is understandably an iconic one. Yet, I don’t recommend that you put in the efforts required to endeavour in this experience.First of all, it’s much more money than it’s worth. I would recommend that, if you want to see views from London, go to the balconies of the Tate Modern Art Gallery or enter the Sky Garden-both of which are free. Second of all, queueing will take you forever in the summer holidays-which could be time wasted if you aren’t staying in London for long.",Poor signing and horrible queues
"August 7, 2019","I had not been before and I thought the signing for where to pay needs to be bigger and more prominent .The queues were horrendous and laid out in zig zag snake pattern, like at the airport and very annoying. I would have liked to know how long to the embarking was when we paid and how long if we upgraded tickets not difficult to do these days. The queue seemed to merge into other queues for other attractions and it was not the greatest experience.As you were about to get in your pod you were held up with a photo opp and a shop which everyone had to pass through, very badly laid out as not everyone wanted the services and it caused further delays.Once on board it was a good experience, pods not overloaded and great views with a cheery welcome and warm goodbye voice recording, staff very helpful disembarking and this was done quickly and efficiently.I would take any Visitors to London again to the attraction but only if you improve the embarkation part of the experience.",London Eye not worth $40.00
"August 7, 2019",Not worth 40.00 to be crowded with 15 to 20 other people in this capsule ride for 30 min . Yes the view is nice but way to expensive .  ,Incredible views
"August 6, 2019",What a great way to see London (especially all of the construction cranes when we were there). 30 minute trip gives plenty of time to look in all directions. Would recommend the skip the line ticket because that saved a lot of time for us as the regular line was crazy long.,Buy the fast track tickets 
"July 29, 2019",We visited the London Eye on our recent trip and bought tickets online the day prior. It’s worth the extra money to buy the fast pass tickets- especially in the summer. We also upgraded to add on the river boat experience on the Thames. Highly recommend! It was a great way to see London. ,Very busy but staff accomadated..
"July 29, 2019",Took my nephew here for the second time as he loves this attraction. Huge queues due to summer holidays but as my nephew has aspergers staff kindly took me to VIP check in for my ticket and then gave us fast track tickets to skip the queues. Made a huge difference to my nephews experience as does not do well in crowds of people. Thank you,A giant ferris wheel 
"July 28, 2019",Great views but a bit pricey for just a 30 minute spin. If you are looking for a place to take a panoramic picture it does afford some of the best views but you will be in an enclosed capsule with 12 or so other people who may or may not have similar hygiene standards and level of manners so it is a bit of a crap shoot.,Family getaway
"July 28, 2019",Great family time. Kids enjoyed it. Got thru fast track due to health and having a little child with me. Friendly staff.great views. Kids and family enjoyed it.,Good experience 
"July 28, 2019",Definitely one to do while in London 👍See all of London from the skies! Great views of all of London 😁,Sunset From the Eye
"July 28, 2019",We caught the last spin of the Eye at about 8:30. The capsule was cool and not very crowded (the temp had been in the 90's).  stunning views across all of London. Serene and enjoyable with the sun beginning to set. Expensive but worth it. ,Amazing experience
"July 28, 2019",Wonderful experience! I can’t express how amazing the London eye is. This was our first time visiting this attraction and it was nothing short of amazing. The views are spectacular and the staff were lovely.,Average tourist experience
"July 28, 2019","The line is too long and the view is just average. We purchased the 2:40 timed tickets, which just means we can enter the waiting line at 2:40. (btw, the signs are not clear, it took us sometime to find the right line) It took us more than 30 minutes waiting. Once on the top, the view is a bit disappointing, not much to be seen or worth taking pictures.",A great View
"July 28, 2019",A 30 minute look above London which allows you to see for many kilometers. Enjoyable but not the most memorable thing I have done.  A great benefit was that the cars were air conditioned at a very hot time.,No need for fast track
"July 28, 2019",We bought the fast track tickets but found that the normal line was about the same length --- thus no benefit.  Wasted our money.,Poor signing and horrible queues

"August 6, 2019","It’s a fantastic experience, but once is defiantly enough. When you see the queue and have already done it I’d say walk straight past and go experience something different in London. ",This was a one off
"August 6, 2019","We purchased a ticket online however we had trouble redeeming it. The staff helped us out and the eye was magical.  I enjoyed the pod which was full with 4 different nationally. Being the first time, it was worth it ",Was ok
"August 6, 2019","We did this at night and although it was nice to see the city lit up, it was hard to see the actual buildings. We paid for fast track and it was worth as the line was very long, the entire process took about 45 minutes.",On a clear day
"August 6, 2019",The view is wonderful.Not worth Fast Track really at £10 per person as the queue does move quite quickly.All in all a nice time,Fantastic views
"August 6, 2019",Although it was a 45 min queue the system to keep you moving was good. Great views and the pods are not too crowded so you can move around to see different views,Great view over London!
"August 6, 2019",Terrific views of Big Ben and all of London from a large gondola you can walk around in to see in all directions during the ride. Great experience but expect long lines.,Day out with family 
"August 6, 2019","I was Never interested in visiting the London eye, so I didn’t follow all the hype But it was a day out with family (my parents wanted to visit) I don’t regret it Sights were awesome the time around was lovely 45 minutes only issue I had was the number of people crammed into the pod felt a little Overcrowded but I’m also afraid of heights so that could be the issue! I enjoyed myself and would do this again ",Is a great experience! A must do.
"July 25, 2019","I was very happy I have bought a fast ticker because queues are long. Make sure you understand if you have to go to the desk to exchange the coupon or if what you have is already a ticket. And arrive with at least 20 minutes prior time.Some relevant landmarks cannot be seen form London Eye, yet the whole experience and the perfection of how this have been developed is worth the experience.","2nd Largest ""Ferris Wheel"" in the World!"
"July 25, 2019","My daughter wanted to do this -- so we took the Tube to Westminister Bridge, and walked over to this attraction. It helps to purchase Fast Track Tickets before hand -- saves a lot of time in the long lines. It’s not really a ferris wheel (though it sure looks like one -- on steroids) -- it's the world’s tallest cantilevered observation wheel.The views were stunning -- and they offered a good photo op from the gondola you ride in. If you're afraid of heights, you might want to skip this -- at the highest point it is almost 445' above ground. After our ride we were amazed at how it dominates the London skyline. We could even see it from St. James Park near Buckingham Palace!Can you imagine: supermodel Kate Moss has been on the London Eye 25 times – the record for any UK celebrity.",Highly recommend you buy your tickets in advance
"July 25, 2019","Unless you get there right when it opens, I highly suggest you buy tickets online. The line to buy the tickets was long and then once you have the tickets the line to get on the Eye is even longer. We intended to buy beforehand, but weren't sure which day we would go. The ride is nice and slow and you can take in the views of London. There are plenty of picture opportunities. Each capsule is rather large, so those who may be afraid of heights might do better on here versus a regular Ferris wheel.",Impressive to See
"July 25, 2019",We were on a bus tour that dropped us off in front of the Eye. We were short for time to the Tower so we didn’t actually get on the Eye. It was also an overcast day so our driver didn’t recommend it. Looks like it would be fun otherwise.,London eye
"July 21, 2019",Beautiful. Definitely worth it. Lines went fast. Not scary at all. Enjoyed it a lot. Would highly recommend,Fantastic views of London
"July 21, 2019","On my bucket list, booked well in advance and we were lucky with a really pleasant day. The Bank holiday was about to begin so preparations were in full swing, crowds collecting so prebooked tickets saved ages of queuing and the actual loading of each capsule was very well organised. It’s a very smooth turn of the great wheel and easy to take photos or a video, really enjoyed it",Mediocre Experience
"July 21, 2019","The London Eye is one of those tourist attractions that are just what you expect them to be, mediocre and crowded. I will say that the queues, whether fast track or regular, moved pretty fast. They are also pretty efficient in which ways to direct people.  What I do not understand about the entire process, is the price. I thought that the price paid (fast track ticket for one adult and one child) was pretty expensive. As you ascend, you realize that there really is nothing too fascinating about going high in the air to view the skyline of London. If you go during the 2019 season, be aware that renovations for Big Ben and Parliament are ongoing so, you will not get a good photo op there. My advice to you is to either wait until the afternoon to go, when all of the initial crowds have left or wait until later in the evening.  But, overall, i would skip this altogether and walk over the many bridges instead to take in the scenery.",Good view of London
"July 21, 2019","It is a nice thing to do. But it is very expensive, even when you buy the combo with another atraction in London. The view is ok. But you can go to other places in London where you have beautiful views as well and do not need to spend any penny",Good Arial View of London
"July 20, 2019",Popular and crowded. You do get a spectacular 360 degree view of London.  The ride lasts 30 minutes. Very steady ride. Even people with motion sickness can handle this. Not: Buy your tickets in advance if possible. You can buy them onsite as well from multiple kiosks. A 4D movie experience is included with the ticket and is located in the tickets office.,Must visit
"July 20, 2019",Must visit This attraction we had some family over so we decided to take them to the London Eye this is definitely a must visit for any tourists visiting London,Spectacular view of the city
"July 20, 2019",Busy tourist attraction but the view of the city is well worth it.  All pods are air conditioned and enclosed so you can't fall out.  Careful when you get on and off of the pod as it's still in motion.  Pods are slow enough that it provides a spectacular view of London.,Great view!
"July 20, 2019","Fast and efficient service. The queue moves fast, so don't bother buying the fast track ticket. Great views, especially on sunny days.",Fabulous view
"July 20, 2019",So worth going! Just a great view of London. Perfect way to get pictures. Love the fact they don’t pack you in the cars. Plenty of room to move around and see.,Great experience 
"July 25, 2019",Last Saturday I decided to get this in with my two friends visiting from the US. We did the fast track as it was only £10 more per person but we were able to board quickly. The queues were very long for normal admission. The pics at the end we took two booklets valued at 25£ each with two pictures and the keychain and magnets. Memories I guess. ,Stunning views
"July 24, 2019","I think anyone who visits London should treat themselves to the London Eye. The views are incredible, all-be-it a bit murky when we did it. We got there early in the morning to get tickets so to avoid the queues. The pod was clean and we only had a few other people in with us. It takes about a hour to complete.",Nice but Dirty Windows and Pictures
"July 24, 2019","Spectacular views but the gondolae are very dirty on the outside. So practically impossible to take pictures from the inside through a clean window, always tons of dirt visible on my pictures. Also they close far too early for a day in July (20.30), so no sunset pics ;-/",Are you afraid of heights
"July 20, 2019","To be honest, this attraction was not on my bucket list but my grandson really wanted to experience it so we went.  The cars hold about 30 people and it moves so slowly that you do not have the sense of being on a carnival ride.  The whole car seems to be made of some type of Plexiglas, including the floor.  My grandson found this very uncomfortable and disorienting and spent most of the rotation sitting on the bench in the middle of the car.   The views are nice but nothing you could not see from other vantage points.  The other thing to be aware of is that the other passengers in your car will compete for the best vantage points and they tend to stay in those spots until a better view is available elsewhere in the car.  If you are not an aggressive person, you probably won't get the photos you were hoping for on this attraction.  Still, the views of historic London are impressive and for those who don't get queasy when they can see what is beneath their feet, it can be a great experience.  ",Nice to see
"July 24, 2019",The London eye is a great 30 minute Ferris wheel ride to see great sites of London. A must do in London.,Spectacular Views and of course Madame Tussauds is a must in London!
"July 24, 2019","I was able to convince my wife to join me on this and she was nervous, but not disappointed. The views were incredible! The only thing I would say is be prepared for very long lines and crowds.",Awesome experience 
"July 23, 2019",This is wonderful ride. Make sure to buy your ticket with the fast pass. It will save you alot of time. Well worth it.,Famous Monument
"July 17, 2019",I did not get the opportunity to get into the monument but visited it by far.  Busy area and nice to see about,Fast Track is the Way to Go!
"July 17, 2019","Had Fast Track tickets for the London Eye. I didn't the last time I took grandchildren, and it took FOREVER to work our way up to the attraction. It is not a scary ride at all. It is benign, you have incredible opportunities to see some 30 miles out, take photos and just chill.It is so iconic that you just have to do it if you are in London, or you won't have had the full London experience. Kids adore it!",Ms
"July 16, 2019","We were not so impressed with this , we we were hurried to get a ticket & had to choose a time to come back - which was worthless- it was merely a time to come and stand in line for 45 minutes before we got on the actual eye they corralled us on with 20 other people that spoke a different language -we felt like a herd of cattle. Once  on the actual vessel the speaker comes on and starts trying to sell additional events. Really truly not worth the money or the time to do it again we would avoid",Fantastic Views
"July 16, 2019","We decided to do the London Eye and, seeing the queue, decided to fast-track and pay the extra ten pounds to do this. Fortunately, given that I  use a walking stick at the moment, fast tracking was free and we were quickly onto the London Eye. Surprisingly the photo that was taken at the start was good so we paid 20 pounds for this. The 30 mins (approx) ride was great. It was a great day with lots of sunshine and we enjoyed every moment of it.",Worth the Wait
"July 16, 2019",Bought our ticket combo with the London Eye river cruise which we took first. It was great taking us past lots of hallmark sights. Returned to dock to see the huge lines waiting for the Eye. Worth the wait to see London from up high. Would buy fast pass next time!,"Best views of London, a must"

"July 16, 2019","The London Eye is a cool feat of engineering that is safe, exciting and provides an amazing view of the entire city of London. There were a couple of people in my family who do not like ferris sheels and are scared of heights, but after mustering up the courage to ride this attraction, they loved every minute of it and never felt uncomfortable. The Pods are huge (accommodating around 20 people or more) and the ride is slow and smooth. A trip to London would not be complete without a ride on this modern addition to a historic city. Also, on a busy day, it was worth the few extra dollars for the fast pass.",Get a good view of the London city
"July 16, 2019",The normal queue was about 45 min wait. If you are in a hurry you can buy the fast track tickets at extre 10 Pounds. If its cloudy would not be worth the money. Quite and moves very slowly. Wheel Chair and disability customers are very well supported. zThey do stop the eye for them. Do not miss the 4d presentation.,Worth the experienc
"July 15, 2019",Not mind-blowing but certainly gives you a birds eye view of London. Slow moving and air conditioned capsules make it comfortable for all ages. Suggest doing it at night or on a clear day. ,Lovely evening
"July 15, 2019","My partner and I booked the London eye for 8:15 on a Saturday night. The queue looked very long however it was continuously moving and only took 20 minutes to get to the front. I haven’t been on the eye since I was little so it was nice to go back, the views were lovely at that time of night but you can get better views from the shard. We only paid £30 altogether which was fine, I wouldn’t pay any more for it! ",Great View
"July 13, 2019","My wife, my daughter and my three grandchildren had a great time during our London Eye Fast Track Ticket with a Professional Guide - a VIP Experience.  Our guide met us at the London Ticket Office at the appointed time.  We skipped past long lines waiting to get tickets and were soon on our way.  We had a great view as we rose silently over the Thames River.  Our guide pointed out various sites and answered questioned posed to him by our group.  In addition to the six of us, there were only four other people on our particular conveyance (gondola).  A great time.  Well worth the money not to have to wait endlessly in long lines.",Great views
"July 13, 2019","Fun to visit but very touristy.  Enjoyed the area of Southwalk.  Be sure to book tickets ahead of time, lines get packed.",Simply awesome!
"July 13, 2019",Absolutely fantastic! Must do if you are in London. Had the fast track ticket because of the long lines and got in with in 10 minutes. Amazing views of London and all the top attractions near the Westminster bridge. If you are afraid of roller coasters or Ferris wheels this is still no problem. No wobble at all and goes very smooth. The 4D experience afterward is also very nice. Don’t miss!,Loved it.
"July 13, 2019",This is a great tourist atttaction. Really love it. The 360 degree view of london was amazing. The rides moves at a great pace so you could enjoy a lot and take plenty of pictures.Queing up does take time however they move it fast. Overall a great experience ,A great view of London 
"July 12, 2019",This is a great way to get a total view of London and the surrounding areas! Make sure you get the fast pass type of ticket to avoid standing in line forever. Get off the Eye and then go right over to the boats. You’ll get lots of information that will help you navigate through London ,Beautiful views

"July 12, 2019","Went to the London Eye with a 10 year old, a few teenagers and adults and everybody enjoyed the experience.  The lines were not too long with the fast track ticket.","London eye with 10, 13 and 15 year old"
"July 12, 2019","During our London visit, each child got to pick an activity. My 15 year-old picked the London Eye. Beautiful view, fun experience, but pricey at over $30/person no child rate. So consider whether this is a must do. Otherwise would have been 5 star. Having heard stories of 2 hour wait times in regular cue during peak season, I shelled out extra for the reserved tickets. We booked for 7:45 as wanted to end our day with it so as not to break up touring during the day (most sites close earlier in the evening so good to plan around least flexible hours first). When we got there saw no line for either fast pass or walk on. Can’t say whether that’s because they close the walk on line earlier or whether there was no walk on line. Did cross my mind if I made a mistake paying extra for reserved, but had the situation been reversed and we missed London eye due to cue, I would have regretted.Recommend going after seeing sites in London as kids enjoyed spotting and pointing out bridges we had seen or places we had been. Extra perk, we were looking for a place to have dinner after London Eye and had perfect scouting view of eateries next to Thames. Having spotted tents we walked North next to Thames to discover a summer festival with food tents ranging from crepes, to Thai to burgers all in a festive environment. Felt we happened upon a wonderful end to our evening with good food and ambiance",Very Good
"July 11, 2019","Booked for this only to see that it had broken down and out of service in our time slot. A quick trip next door to Shrek's Adventureand we noticed it was working again. Staff brilliant at getting us on board. Super helpful. Sunday afternoon is super busy. Honestly,, it is worth the fast trackto save the hassle. ",Informative commentary on river cruise
"July 10, 2019","My daughter had always wanted to do the London Eye, I am not keen on heights so had always put it off. On our recent trip back to the U.K I could put it off no longer!The queues were really long but they did move swiftly and for £6 for an adult bolt on and a £3 child bolt on for the river cruise it was a no brainer. The London Eye was okay, our pod was full so I got jostled and feet trodden on a lot, didn’t help my phobia one not and I frankly couldn’t wait to get back down. There was also a lot of cranes, if construction views are your bag then you will love it, otherwise I would give it a miss.The boat trip however was awesome. I had previously lived in London but still found out new facts. Chloe was really good, informative and with a dry sense of humour that kept me engaged and listening. I would personally take the boat trip over the Eye...personal opinion.",Amazing 
"July 10, 2019","Needless to say that The London Eye is hugely popular, hence there were mega queues, all seemingly merging into one with different ‘tour guides’ looking for their Groups etc.Not clear that, in the commotion, you have to get your tickets in The Ticket Hall across the way and NOT at The Eye.The Ticket Office was also rammed to capacity with many, many differing languages. However once all that was sorted out the operation was quick and efficient.The views are spectacular - the pods are not crammed with people and so it is very relaxing and most enjoyable and fun.Well Done!",the fast track is great
"July 10, 2019","the whole experience was very nice. We were very lucky as the weather was beautiful, but apart from that the 4D film before is excellent and the fast track was super as there was a very long line even at 10am",Will do it again!
"July 9, 2019","We visited the London Eye as part of an MBNA Clipper catamaran river cruise. The whole experience from boarding to leaving leaving the catamaran was great. We were able to enjoy the sights from both the perspective of the river and from way up high. The passenger capsule was large enough for guests to move about and take advantage of the 360 views. Next time we are in London, we will do it again!",A Birds Eye View
"July 9, 2019","The London Eye is a nice way of getting a view over the city.On research, you are encouraged to purchase your ticket online. There is a lot of fuss over purchasing a fast track or flexi ticket. Personally, I feel this is unnecessary. I would recommend that you purchase a standard ticket online and then get there for 9-9:30 in the morning to get ahead of the queue. It is much like being on a big wheel and lasts 30mins.We did get some fab photos of the city",One of those must see and do places
"July 9, 2019",bought the ticket on one their busiest days!! Saturday July 6th 2019. long lines but if you want to visit during day time definitely recommend the fast track ticket. we went in the regular line around 630 and took us 30 minutes to the ride.,Nice way to view the city and pass a little time
"July 9, 2019","The London Eye was our first stop on our tour of the city. Was hoping to get some information about where things are and what we were seeing, but no such luck. You pretty much had to do your own research to know what you were seeing.  I do suggest you buy your tickets beforehand so you can skip the line to purchase them. It was cool to see the city from high up, but if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't bother.",Great views
"July 9, 2019","This is a one timer.  We had a clear day so the views were great.  However, they are placing too many people in each pods and if you are short, like me, the other people block the views and camera shots.","Glad we did it, but only if you have extra time!"
"July 9, 2019","The views from the Eye were amazing, but with so much being repaired, you see A LOT of cranes and scaffolding! i'm glad we did it, but if you are crunched for time in London, maybe do something else. I would do this if you had extra time, but maybe skip it in a rushed trip.",Nice but not the best way to view 
"July 8, 2019","A little bit expensive price, the view are good but not much as expected.Very long cue and hot weather in summer, and the online appointment that we did has no meaning. ",A good attraction for seeing some of the London sights
"July 8, 2019",As with most of these attractions it’s best to get there early and also if you pre-book tickets it usually works out cheaper. It’s a really good idea to have a map with you before you go into one of the pods because then you can see all the attractions from the pod and link them to places on the map if you’re not quite sure what is what. It takes about 30 minutes to go around in one complete revolution from start to finish. It’s right next door to the London dungeon and a couple of other attractions so it may be worth looking at buying a ticket for several attractions all at once and doing more than one thing as that works out much cheaper.  ,"An eyesore on the skyline, but a vaguely interesting view."
"July 6, 2019","I have always considered the London Eye (under its many sponsorship brands over the last 20 years) as being a blot on the London riverside skyline.Having finally been persuaded to ride it I find it no less of an intrusion along the river, but the ride was at least novel.  I remain unsure that the minimal entertainment value justifies either its presence or the cost of the ticket, mind.",Definitely a must even if it isn't extremely exciting 
"July 6, 2019","We loved the London Eye. I certainly think that it's a great experience to enjoy in London. You can see so much and get an excellent idea of where everything is. I recommend the skip the line tickets if it's in your budget. We had a much shorter wait than the traditional line, however, if you are going at a slower time, it might be worth it to save the money. By the end, my 10 and 8 year old were asking if it was over yet, but overall, they really enjoyed it. It is air conditioned but perhaps not to American standards. It was quite warm.",Nice view
"July 6, 2019","The price of thirty pounds was quite steep in my opinion, for comparison the Singapore flyer costs around 20 pounds, while the smaller Hong Kong one is three pounds. The view of from the Ferris wheel was nice and not too many people were put into each cabin as I feared would happen. The wait was somewhat long at twenty minutes, but I went during a weekday around 3:00 so probably one of the least busiest times.",Stunning views
"July 5, 2019","Now a modern icon in London, I find the views to be stunning and the experience to a lot of fun.  That being said, it's not the cheapest 30 minutes, and if you add the fast track option it can really add up.  Buying your tickets online 24 hours or more in advance saves you a few dollars, and if you combine it with a river tour, you can save more, but the downfall with buying online is you have to know exactly when you are going to go, eg 1:15-1:30pm.  Regardless of when you go, there will likely be line-ups.  Beware there is a line-up to buy/collect your ticket, then a line-up to get on the London Eye.  To minimize wait time, usually the first one or two hours of the day tend to be better, and better on a weekday than on a weekend.  Of course you can take the fast track option, which can save you anywhere from 30-75 minutes depending on the length of the lines, but at 10 Pounds more per ticket, it's a bit pricey, but time is money. Regardless, the London Eye is a must try experience.  ",its a glorified farriswheel
"July 5, 2019",Slow moving large glass domes. Can see London but I found it boring after half of the trip. Did not hold 11 yr olds interest either./,Good way to see things from a distance 
"July 5, 2019","My husband, my 13 year old daughter and myself did this. It was a nice experience but the line was way too long. Not sure I’d be willing to wait in a line like that with small kids. ",Wonderful experience
"July 5, 2019","Not inexpensive and expect very long lines and few if any available seats for waiting.  We paid a few pounds extra for the VIP queue; there was still a wait of about an hour from the time we arrived, but it was well worth it.  Lovely views, lovely photos.",Not worth the Money
"July 5, 2019","I and 3 others booked a slot for the London eye at 1:30 pm when we arrived (half an hour early as instructed) the queue was over an hour, we queried about our time slot but we were just told to get to the back of the queue which was around the corner. We didn't end up going onto the London eye due to the queue times & the heat.Don't use the vending machine in the ticket office either as we attempted to get some water out, it never came out but we were debted £12.We spoke to the staff in the ticket office who confirmed we could get a refund however we booked online so we had to email them and they would refund us. We have emailed the office and haven't heard anything back it has been over a week and from reading other reviews it doesn't look hopeful.",Fast pass but not necessary
"July 4, 2019","As many people have said, a fast pass and prebooking are truly not necessary. Having said that, I paid for the fast pass and it only saved me no more than 5 mins!  So buy regular tickets when you want to go and just line up in the regular line. It’s an awesome 30 mins as it gives you a cool view from up high. Great for a few pics and for the experience. Would probably not do it again as it was £40 pounds each!",Much better than general admission
"July 3, 2019","Two years ago, we used General Admission and were frustrated by the wait.  This time, we purchased the Fast Track and are so glad we did.  Tremendous difference.  Well worth the few dollars extra.",Beautiful view at a cost
"July 8, 2019",We went on a the London Eye as we thought it was a must. The view was spectacular and loved the experience however it was very expensive (close to $240 AUD). You do get an awesome view but I’m not sure it was worth the cost! Best to couple it with Madame Tassauds for a better price if you’re keen .,never made it past the queue
"July 8, 2019","too many people. arrived exactly at prebooked slot, and was told that we needed to wait for another hour to get in. our schedule didnt allow, so we skipped.oversold experience.",VIP Champagne Experience
"July 8, 2019","I would really recommend this. No queueing, relaxing in the VIP lounge with a champagne cocktail overlooking the eye before being escorted to the cabin for the trip. More champagne on board. Excellent , no fuss, no tress",Spectacular views
"July 7, 2019","From boarding the MBNA Clipper until the completion of the ride on the London Eye, the views of the skyline were spectacular. The cabin was comfortable and the aft section was a good location for photos on the river. There is plenty of room in the capsule on the Eye for passengers to view the sights from every angle.",Great way to see London from above
"July 7, 2019","Great way to see London from above .Spacious gondola with seating if needed ,but can be very busy in peak times ",Nice views 
"July 7, 2019","As Merlin Premium passholders, we decided to do the London Eye. We went to the information stand in order to book a time slot and the man told us 4:15, 20 minutes passed and we looked at the ticket he had issued us with and it said 4:45 so we had a slight panic as we had things to do at 5:15 (the attraction is about 30 minutes long) - we went back and he said “yeah you need to queue at 4:15” so that’s what we did. The whole thing was really confusing. Not quite sure why our ticket said 4:45 if we were allowed in at 4:15? As Merlin holders, we get fast track which is definitely worth it. The queues were huge!! The London Eye itself is good for views across London. You can see many tourist attractions, such as Buckingham Palace. If I wasn’t a pass holder, then I wouldn’t pay for the Eye though as I feel it’s overpriced. I would definitely do this again, but only with my Merlin pass. ",Eye in the sky
"July 7, 2019","Do This!!  A phenomenal view of London and all the iconic buildings.  The pods are spacious, have seating in the middle and are easy to move around in while you go on your journey to the top and back down again.  Plenty of photo opportunities and smooth and quiet.  Definitely recommend.",Nice view
"July 6, 2019",2013Everything about this was awesome. This is a must in London. Very nice highlight of a bday trip .Viewing London at the top on the London eye while sipping champagne🍾.Great memories..It's kid friendly as well minus the champagne😄,Expensive and Not Worth It
"July 6, 2019","They say this is the most visited tourist attraction in the UK.  It certainly feels that way but having done it I can't imagine why.  The fast track ticket did get us priority entrance but when we went at 8:30 in the evening there were hardly any lines.  For a family of 4 the fast track tickets cost us nearly $175.  You enter a pod with a dozen other people and then spend 30 minutes seeing the London skyline.  However, with the exception of Parliament/Big Ben right across the river there really isn't all that much to see.  Its difficult to take pictures with the glass surrounding you and the views just aren't that exciting.  It feels like this is something you ""have to do"" when you visit London but I'd recommend you skip it.  It just wasn't worth it.  Even my kids - ages 10 & 13 - didn't rank this as a highlight of our London trip.  If it is true that this is the most visited tourist attraction then it is very likely that it is the least re-visited attraction.",I liked it a lot more than I thought I would
"July 6, 2019","I was here with a University group in London for 48 hours on the way home to the USA.  Although I thought of it as too much of a tourist trap, it was one of the most requested activities from my group.  When I found out there a huge discounts for school and university groups I added it and the river cruise associated with it to our agenda.  It was great.I am afraid of heights, so I wasn't actually sure I would not chicken out.  It turns out that I had no problem at all.  The pads are so big, it turns so slowly, and the support spokes are so massive that I had absolute no fear at all.By getting the river tour first, we knew what to look for from the eye.I am glad that my students talked me into adding it to the London itinerary and encouraged me to go on board.",London Eye experience
"July 2, 2019",Prepaid tickets so just got in the long queue which moved very quickly. Tickets scanned and we were in a pod overlooking London within 5 minutes. Slow and steady rotation and on the day we went it was lovely clear and sunny so a great view. Don't particularly believe it is great value as it is quite expensive ( £30 each at the time of going ) for a half an hour view of London. You wouldn't need to do it again though.,Eye for London 
"July 2, 2019",A great way to start a day to see whole of London. Awesome experience with my love one. One of the highlights of our anniversary trip to Europe.,A must do!!
"July 2, 2019",The London Eye is amazing. The view from the eye is breath taking. It’s a Ferris wheel with each capsule able to hold 20 or so people. It moves slowly so you can get beautiful pics. Highly recommend!!,Good view. Nothing else.
"July 2, 2019","Good view of London. Enough time to take pics. Make sure you take pics when you are at the top, as it's only downhill from there. The river cruise is also good. The guide was fun, though a but lame but who cares.The cruise takes you till tower bridge, which you might have thought was London bridge until now, but it's not.The queue is big but fast progressing.",Not scary at all; great photo ops.
"July 2, 2019","Do this, if nothing else, for the views. You'll get some great pics and it's not scary at all. They don't crowd the cars too much and there's plenty of room to walk around. It's a super-touristy thing to do, but pretty cool. ",Great view
"July 1, 2019", This was an enjoyable event with great views of London. The lines moved fast. I highly recommend this stop on a London vacation. ,ok but too crowded
"July 1, 2019",The High Roller in Las Vegas is so much better than this one.  But this one of course has all the views of historic London.  it's just too crowded though.  They should open longer hours.,Look for a 2 for 1 Train Ride Ticket
"June 30, 2019","Excellent views for the first time visitor to London.  You can get great pictures of the London, if it is not raining.  Gives a good overview of London and where you've been or plan on going.",Great!! 
"June 30, 2019",We had to que for a time but it was worth the wait....something I would encourage everyone to do once! It's an experience! ,"Walked right in, but the regular line wait was maybe 10 minutes"
"June 30, 2019","We pre-booked the Eye online and purchased tickets which allowed us to arrive anytime and be fast tracked. With the online savings, it was about the same price as if we'd bought the ticket on-site.  The Eye is enjoyable but it's over pretty quickly for the price.  We were lucky as we had only 2 other couples on board with us, but the next two cars were full of children on a school outing. We also used the tickets for the additions, which were okay, but the movie is so-so and the lounge is not worth it (pricey drinks, full and noisy).  That all said, if i were going to the Eye on a busy, sunny day, I would still purchase a fast-track ticket.",American Mom and 12 Year Old Son
"June 26, 2019","Stunning view- paid for faster admission, which looking at the lines was worth it.  Enjoyed the 4D movie ahead of time.  I feel like it is a must see, but not something you'd ever feel like you had to repeat.  If you have ever been to Wall Drug in the U.S., I'd say it offers that same feeling.  You have to do it, but you'd say once is enough.",A must do London attraction

"June 26, 2019","a sort of ""must do"" which doesn't disappoint. Go early - it's a very crowded area and the queue at the Eye is fairly slow.  We were ""with wheelchair"" and were well looked after - somewhat of a fast track.   The pods are not overcrowded and have a bit of seating.  If you know London sights it is nice,  if you are seeing them for the first time it must be fairly amazing.If you can - go when you have visited a few other places so you can orientate - pick your previous places out even!",Great ride

"June 26, 2019",Usually we avoid this type of mega attraction. However with 12 and 14 year old granddaughters who suggested it. Bought tix online and saw a huge line when we arrived. Joined it and surprisingly moved quite fast. Boarding the module was a little thrilling as it was moving. It was clean and not overcrowded. The ride took about 30 minutes.  Of course the views were spectacular. Lot a pix and fun with girls. A good trip.,Dry sense of humor of River Cruise Director was hysterical
"June 25, 2019",The London Eye provided excellent views of London. The guided River Cruise provided a great history lesson with humor and wit. A great way to see the city!,Day out!!
"June 25, 2019","What an excellent way to spend 1/2 hour seeing London from a great height. The actual organisational side of things are excellent, your not in the queues very long and then the staff promptly gets you on and your away. A fantastic attraction to visit absolutely brilliant!!",Not quite worth the money 
"June 24, 2019",For two people at 60-80 pound based on whether you go fast track. If you want a good view go with the shard ,the view is breathtaking
"June 24, 2019",I went on a sunny afternoon and it was great I could see well outside the city . Buy the fast track ticket it is worth the extra 10 pounds . It only took 15 min verses 45 min in the regular line. ,Vacation 
"June 24, 2019","Buy the fast pass a day ahead of time, saves you money and time.

Could see very far and the views were gorgeous. Highly recommended.",Fantastic views
"June 30, 2019",You really get to see the London skyline and the ride is also fun.  Thd capsules are completely enclosed and very comfortable.  You can walk around for different views or sit on the bench in the middle.  I walked and got some great pictures.,Worth a look!
"June 30, 2019","Not much to say that hasn’t been said before here.Its one of these things that is worth doing once, the best views I think are over Westminster area.Aim for slightly later in the day, usually not so busy and sunset makes the backdrop over the big smoke a lot nicer!",What I expected 
"June 29, 2019",This was a nice diversion from museums but was about what I expected. Not a disappointment but also not a wow. ,"Nice, expensive and crowded"
"June 29, 2019",We bought a 20% discounted ticket on one of the bus tours. It is comparably expensive and you should know that buying the fast lane is only a reasonable option if you're going afternoon with regular lines being insanely long. Otherwise it's not worth the money.Nice view. Very well organized boarding and security. Can't complain. Is it worth it? Dunno. It's good for some stunning pictures. That's for sure.,Great experience-better than expected
"June 29, 2019",My husband and I visited the London eye for the first time. The staff were really friendly and helpful. They couldn’t have been more courteous. The queues looked long but they moved really fast. We didn’t pre book tickets-just turned up and within about 20 minutes we were in one of the capsules. The capsules are very sturdy. No rocking about or anything. You basically feel like you’re in a big oval shaped living room made of glass!! You get really amazing views across London and can see a lot of the historical sites from the London eye. I would recommend to everyone to try it out at least once!,London eye and river cruise

With fast track we sat in the cabin immediately and enjoyed beautiful views. It makes a round for approximately 25 minutes, there are 22-23 people in the cabin.

It covers very little of London and without any audio in background, one does not does not understand of whatever little is seen. I could have better look of Westminster Abbey and Big Ben, from the ground. Or better take a boat cruise.If you are on short visit, better avoid",This Is a Must!

"June 23, 2019","London Eye gives great views of this great city.  That is only to be expected.  However, as a complete experience, I didn't find it first class mainly because of the long waiting time in the queue on a Saturday.  What's the point in reserving a 15min time slot and waiting in the queue for 45min?  At the very least, it disturbs your other plans for the day. Go if you need to tick this off your list.  Or maybe when the waiting is slightly bearable on weekdays.  I bought a combo ticket which included London Eye, Madame Tussauds and Bigbus Classic tour.  It turns out significantly cheaper than doing these attractions individually.",Great experience and awesome view but very crowded in carriages
"June 23, 2019","Worth doing because it’s the London Eye, but the carriages get very very crowded which makes the experience not as enjoyable as it could be. It can be hard to move around the carriage and get good photos. Would recommend doing but just be prepared.",Silver wedding celebrations
"June 23, 2019","We loved every minute of our experience upon the eye.

"
"June 23, 2019","As you can imagine travelling on a sunny Saturday in June this was very busy. The queue even though you’ve booked a time slot looks huge but to be fair moves quickly  and is managed well. The views over London are spectacular but it would be nice if people were more considerate in the pods in terms of sharing the views, especially when you have small children that want to see but some people won’t move at all. It is very expensive as well, I realise it’s a prime attraction in a capital city but still stings a bit! ",London Eye Fast Track
"June 22, 2019",This is a fantastic way to see all of London.  Important...do not buy your tickets ahead of time.  Weather in London can be crystal clear and see forever. Or it can have fog come in and you can't even see one bridge which ruins the whole experience.  We bought our fast track and had a beautiful day and experience. The next day was fog and rain. That said plan carefully,A billion dollars but the kids liked it 
"June 22, 2019","This was insanely expensive but it was the one thing my 6 yr old asked to do, so we did. He seemed to really enjoy it. I would have preferred a cheaper and shorter ride. My 3 yr old threw a fit & I felt bad for all the people (lots of them) trapped in the pod with us. They put a lot more people in one pod than I imagined. I will say, I did pay extra for the fast lane tickets. Otherwise we would have waited forever. There’s a kiosk right inside the ticket office, so you can purchase the tickets yourself. Super fast & convenient. Views were of course phenomenal. ",Tourist trap
"June 22, 2019","It was ok - I'm not sure about the hype. Yes, you see London from a birds eye view but was it worth it waiting in line? Our 'pod' had several zealous photo 'hogs' so that was annoying, as well. I'd take a river ride before you spend your money on this.",Amazing views!
"June 21, 2019",Highly recommend- the pictures and the views are amazing!  Well worth the cost of the ticket - buy skip the line tickets (in advance if you can) and avoid the lines.,Not to be missed
"June 21, 2019",Great first stop on any visit to London.   You can get a bird's eye view of the city and what you want to see later in the day.,Not bad!
"June 21, 2019","This was my first time on the Eye, however I have previously climbed to the top of St Paul's, and the view from up there is just as good in my opinion. Although, you do get a full 360 degree view from the London Eye. You're on the Eye for about 20 mins. I feel a little longer might be nicer (I don't think I would mind 2 rotations), but for a view of London, this is something you should definitely do.",Definitely worth the visit!!

"June 20, 2019","The lines are long, the ride is boring, the kids were bored, and the tickets are too expensive for what the experience.  Zero things to see above London, sans construction.  We counted at least 41 construction cranes in the skyline.  So so Boring.  Save your Euro!!!!  This thing should be free and it’s in a completely tourist trappy lane.",Kind of expensive and crowded
"June 19, 2019","It's a good way to see a birds-eye view of London, but the ride itself is kind of underwhelming.  Somewhat crowded pods, and if one of the guests has BO, as one did in our pod :(, it makes for a LONG 30-minute ride around the loop.",Amazing views of the city

Half hour to soak up all the sights of Westminster Bridge, Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, The Shard and the River Thames as well as sights from around the city.  The only down side was I booked it for 8pm thinking we would see London with night views but it is still light at 9.30pm in June",Much better than expected
"June 19, 2019","This was on the must do list and like the Eiffel Tower, was so much better than expected. We did the champagne tour and our host was lovely.  Greatly enjoyed the sights from the top.  It was really cool to have a 360’ look at London.  It is something I won’t forget.",Great fun 
"June 18, 2019",It was good fun thing but way over price for what u can see and do in there . And there's  a big Q  for every where in that place. Worth a visit  tho ,Great view
"June 17, 2019",The line up looked lengthy but went by much faster than we expected.The pod we were in had a good amount of people and didn’t feel over packed.Great views and it was enough time to look around and take pictures without being rushed but did not feel too long.There was a bench in the pod to rest which was nice or you were free to stand.Would suggest anyone or any age to do it. Personally I was gong to skip it but glad I did it.,Nice experience!
"June 17, 2019",It was worth it! Even if the queue is long but it is running so you won’t get bored. Good experience!,Fun day out
"June 16, 2019",Long que but the time was short. The views were great even though overcast. Friendly staff. The fast pass was not purchased but not really needed. ,London May 2019
"June 16, 2019",So you have to rid the London Eye when in London.  The views are amazing along the the River Thames.  You get a birds eye view.  Purchase your ticket online and add the skip the line.  It's totally worth it.  I showed up at my designated time and got right on.  Spend some time enjoying the excellent street performers after the ride.  Totally worth it.,brilliant experience
"June 16, 2019",you have your dlot time and effectively queue up from then. goes fairly quickly.i am a bit scared of heights but strangely this felt absolutely ok. great views from the eye as you would expect. awesome photo opportunities.would highly recommend ,a great way to get a birds eye view
"June 16, 2019","The London Eye created a capsule filled with a floral garden to give an eye opener feel to the show. There were many ways to utilize the time in the capsule- one could hire one for a personalized experience or have a champagne experience, celebrate a birthday, yoga, anniversaries and so forth, the options were many",Great Views
"June 16, 2019","Been on it a few times and it’s always nice to go on a clear sunny day. Queues are long, but book in advance and you skip it.On a busy day, you’ll have quite a few people in your capsule. The annoying ones take selfies. Enjoy the moment and ditch the camera. Yiu might even get a discount with an Oyster Card, but double check. ",Nice views but not a must-do
"June 16, 2019","A friend of mine and I visited here on a Friday evening, as neither of us had never done the London Eye before. It was still fairly light when we visited (around 8.30pm) - and I would possibly recommend visiting just a bit later if you wanted to see the city lights all lit up. The views were really good as expected, and we were pleasantly surprised at the lack of any queue at all. I would recommend visiting the London Eye, although you can get an equally good view from other places in London, if you go for a meal or a drink in one of the high rise restaurants - so it depends if you are willing to pay or the novelty of being on a giant ferris wheel.",London in a day
"June 16, 2019","We were staying in Paris and could only get to London for a day, via Eurostar. So knowing how limited our time was, we booked skip the line tickets for the 28th May but we booked tickets that did not lock us into a time and even though they were a bit more expensive, it worked with our limited time. Once we made it to the Eye, we went into a separate skip the line queue (which really wasn't much of a queue) and we were on the  Eye within 10 mintues at the most after arriving there. A great way to get an overall view of London, being able to see certain landmarks from the Eye that we just could not get to by foot or bus. Each pod seemed to only have about 12 people in them which made it easy to get close to the glass for photos. The pod we were in was clean  and roomy. There was also a bench seat in the middle if you needed to sit. Took about 1/2 or slightly more but so glad we did this and booked skip the line and not lock in time. ",Nice view
"June 16, 2019","The ferris wheel itself is high, but not particularly pretty. The view is good, but there are probably other places to get a view of London from above for a cheaper price. Maybe it's a better experience during sunset. The ticket includes an ""amazing 4D experience"", which is, sorry to say, not amazing.",Great view 
"June 16, 2019",This provides a great view of the city and was not crowded when we arrived late in the afternoon.  Kind of pricey for what you get but the views are worth it.  The 4d video is fair.  Could skip it.  ,Don’t miss it
"June 15, 2019","The views are spectacular, this activity is well worth doing. If you have the first ticket @ 10 am, they tell you to arrive @ 9:30, but that just meant we had to stand in the rain for 20 minutes; they won’t let you in early and nothing around there opens until 10. Also, we did the fast track tix, which was fine, but if you’re going to go early, they were letting walk ins in along with the fast trackers. Go early and then take the river stroll to the tower bridge, maybe 3-4 miles, a very pleasant walk.",Informative view 
"June 15, 2019","As a claustrophobic and afraid of heights person, I can recommend this activity!  Do go. The view is spectacular. The movement very slow and steady. And the focus is out from you - not really straight down. Do get a map to help you locate points of interest vee went in a light rain and it was still OK. ",Great views
"June 15, 2019",Such a pretty way to see London at night.  Our group enjoyed the ride and it was the perfect amount of time. ,Incredible View!
"June 15, 2019","I was wowed by the views...it doesn’t seem that tall by big city standards, so I didn’t expect much, yet you can see everything in London from the Eye. So glad we went! The 30 minutes went by too quickly.The price is steep (60 Pounds for 2 pp for same day, slightly cheaper online but the site wouldn’t let us book tickets, it just didn’t work which seemed to happen with more than one location in London). A group of extremely loud Italians literally yelled the entire time we were in the Eye, people should use their “inside voices” and be considerate of others in the cars or reserve a private car. I’ll have to dub our video to drown them out.",Great
"June 15, 2019",Went on the London eye with my 10 year old son. Enjoyed the ride with great views and not too many people in the pod with us. ,Bird's eye view
"June 14, 2019",Enjoy unrivaled views of London from the Eye. Ensure to plan your trip on a sunny or clear day so that you may enjoy unobscured views. Twilight will be a good time to vist as one can see day and night views. The ride lasts around 30-35 minutes.,Lives up to its name
"June 14, 2019","Good views of all the main landmarks beside the Thames. They don’t fill up the capsules, which is good as there is enough space inside to move around comfortably and take pictures and enjoy the view from all sides.The queues are long, and it makes sense to choose the fast-track ticket if you are not in a mood to wait in the slow-moving winding queue.",London Eye afternoon visit
"June 5, 2019","London Eye was ok, nothing special I would add. We have visited in the afternoon, so maybe during the evening is more attractive.You have a nice view on the city and is quite relaxing activity. ",My Favorite place in London

"June 4, 2019","The river cruise was just okay, but don't miss the London Eye, the views were spectacular.  I highly recommend the London Eye, the river cruise, not the so much.",Unique Experience
"June 4, 2019",First of all...purchase the tickets that bypass the long lines.  Also worth purchasing the book that includes a map of everything you will see as you go around...takes about 30 minutes.  ,A bit of a let down
"June 4, 2019","London eye is like one of the most iconic places when you think of London. And maybe because of that I was full of expectations when going into this. The service is okay, even With a line we got in fairly quickly, but it was kinda disappointing for me. The view was ok, almost the but not all that, for the money your paying you are there for half an hour, a bit stuck on the angles the capsules are at the moment. It ends kinda quickly and even though the view is nice it is kind of overpriced and super touristy, you're assaulted by memorabilia entering and leaving. Not awful but not the best experience...",Pleasant visit with my mother in law in her wheelchair
"June 4, 2019","The superb staff gave us all the help needed! Certainly, beat the ques. Lovely view of London. Never been at night so that is my next option.",What a view
"June 3, 2019","Fortunately we went when it wasn't crowded.  Takes about half an hour to make a complete rotation, but a great view of London from the top.  Was dramatic the day we went as a Thunderstorm popped up just as we were at the top.",refused a refund when the attraction had technical difficulties!
"June 3, 2019","Was very disappointed when i brought my 10 year old on a trip to the London Eye. We queued for about an hr to only be told there had been technical difficulties with the ride (which is understandable these things happen), we got a leaflet to say how to re-book, but unable to get a refund! As this was no fault of our own i believe we are entitled to a refund. i can not afford another trip to London or able to get time off work etc. The staff there were not very helpful as they would answer anyone's questions, We left very disappointed with our experience :(",On a clear day ...........
"June 3, 2019","On a clear day you can see all around you, so the song goes!  Wow the views are fantastic.  I found everyone on board willing to share the views from around the sides of the cabin as it moves very slowly and with no distinct shakes.  30 plus minutes of a fantasy world, we even saw the Guards practicing on Horse Guards Parade for the Trooping of the Colour.  The queues are typical winding sort, just like Disney, but they move quickly and the staff are incredible efficient at loading and loading.  Well worth the money but better to book tickets on line before hand.  There is also a Fast Track system available.  If the weather is hot do remember your bottle water and possibly hat. Your bags are checked before entering the line.",Great
"June 2, 2019",The London eye is great but only if you do the fast pass. No way I would stand in line for that long.,Never disappoints 
"May 28, 2019",Been on the eye a few times but not since it was Coca Cola.   Very quick to get on and such a nice view.   Can’t say much more other than I recommend the London explorer pass.  We used those on the eye and other attractions.  Worlds a treat and saves loads of money in real terms. ,amazing deal
"May 28, 2019","We got the combo ticket, dungeon, London eye, sealife, tussauds and the bus tour. Well worth the money great deal and saves loads of money, dungeon was great fun, the eye was amazing but be prepared to queue, sealife really interesting and plenty to see, Madam tussauds is worth the money and so much to see, loved the little ride that is part of it and the 4d mini film is fun, bus tour was ok but as traffic was really bad it took away from the fun side of it. All in all combo ticket really worth the money.",Nice experience
"May 27, 2019","Although I was initially scared to be so up in the air,while being in the cabin I felt like being on the floor,very nice ,specially for families although quite expensive.",Rubbish
"May 27, 2019",Thankfully I only paid £24 for myself & my teenage daughter as we used the codes off the Kelloggs cereal boxes but even then I felt robbed. It goes so slow and you can see out of the windows because they put so many people in each pod. Never again!,Fast Path Rules
"May 26, 2019",We got in an out under an hour with a “Fast Path”. We would recommend doing upon arrival to understand the city.  Staff was pleasant and helpful,Waste of money 
"May 25, 2019","We had gone on the city cruises boat tour which was way more better and informative to see the sights from the ground and walk around.I heard many bad reviews on the eye however wanted to give a shot for ourselves. Was very disappointed with the amount of money you pay when you really do not see much at all nothing different to be honest I think other cities around the world have better sky views than the wheel. Also while you are in there, there is a label on the floor stating ""photo zone"" BUT they do not prepare or indicate when the photo will be taken. All the people in our capsule had no idea either and the flash went off when everyone was wondering around.As our tour guide stated you actually are better off going to the free sky deck view which was across the river facing the shard.",Fun
"May 25, 2019",It is definitely worth checking out for great views and pics. The price is a little steep but the half hour trip was so unique and fun,Fun
"May 24, 2019","Went on the London Eye. Very good value. Buy your ticket in the park they have a two for one, the Eye and boat ride. The views were fabulous. ",Stupendous view
"May 24, 2019",A slow and steady ride which is not overwhelming if you are afraid of heights the only drawback is the skyline is been cluttered by high rise buildings and tending to obscure the older historic landmarks. Potential for interesting photographic shots ,Loved the ride and the view
"May 23, 2019","It went slowly enough, that I didn't get motion sickness! I did the Champagne Sunset Ride and had a blast.",Great Location
"May 23, 2019","I think the view would be amazing from the London Eye, were it not for the fact that they close super early (8:30 pm), which sadly, I missed. Also strange to me was that the gift shop also closed at that time. So ixnay on buying souvenirs there. Best bet is to pre-order your tickets and get there by sunset. ",Expensive but Unforgettable 
"May 23, 2019","This really is one of the must-do things in London, as long as you can afford it. It’s certainly not cheap - £30 for an adult and not much less for a four-year-old when we visited, similar to the Shard - but it’s hard to beat as a way of seeing the city from up on high.You get a 30-minute ride taking you up above the Thames with unparalleled views of Parliament and the surrounding area. You’re able to move around within the capsule - something our four-year-old loved as she went from side to side taking it all in. She picked it out as the best thing we did in London when we got home. ",Good view
"May 16, 2019","The line was faster than i expected , actually it's a great view of the city and Tamesis river.Takes 30 min to complete the round, time is perfect, you could enjoy your time taking pictures .","Glad I did it but it is just a Ferris wheel, after all."
"May 15, 2019","It seems as though one has to go on the Eye, and I am not sorry that I did.  However, it is just as expected.  It is easy to get a ticket and the line was not very long (I did not pay extra for the fast track).",Great Way to Begin a London Trip
"May 21, 2019",This is the perfect spot to begin a trip to London. It’s a great opportunity to really orient yourself with the city and get a different perspective of many of the famous sites in London.  This is well worth the ~1-2 hours it takes to complete.,amazing views
"May 21, 2019","This attraction lasts 30 minutes. The views are wonderful, due to the location right by big ben, Thames river, parliament, etc.",View of the river and London
"May 21, 2019","This was our second time in London, but the first time we jumped on the Eye.  Wow, it was something else!  It doesn't not spin real fast, so you have plenty of time to see the sights around the Thames River. A must do if you have time.",Amazing ride
"May 21, 2019",A ride of the london eye that too in rain.... just simply amazing.... though it might be an understatement. Do get the fast track ticket to avoid the queue and save time.,Brilliant on a clear day
"May 21, 2019","We got very lucky with the weather, clear sunny day and could see for miles.   Great way to pick out the various sights from the top of the wheel. It moves nice and slowly so plenty of time to see all the sights. If the weather is clear its a Must do attraction when in London.",Fun
"May 20, 2019",This was so much fun to get on during the day but at night the view is amazing. Must get on when visiting London. ,Beautiful View
"May 20, 2019","We went the perfect time of year!  The weather was beautiful and there was minimal waiting time.  The cruise was fantastic.  Our guide, Victoria, was energetic and quite informative.  What a great experience!",Standard Ticket Pre ordered- Pay For A Fast Track
"May 20, 2019","I guess when sightseeing in London, this is on the to do list, however, the view from The Shard is far superior and from Sydney Tower and the Sands Sky Deck in Singapore etc As the title suggest, we paid for the London eye ticket through a tour company as an add on to a day tour. When lining up to get these pre booked ticket, I jumped at the chance to fast track. The line for both the ticket and then to board the eye was extensive. Worth the extra 10 pounds each. The ride was underwhelming I have to say and of all the attractions we visited in Europe and London, this was the least photographed. The weather was perfect but it was almost disappointing. If you are time poor and you miss this one, it is not the end of the world. Perhaps the evening ride is more captivating?",Worth a go 
"May 14, 2019",Had a great time. The views are amazing. It’s exspensive for what it is though. Very high security which is amazing. Just found it a little boring! This was my 2nd time showing a mate. Cool experience but you can go up any building in London & get the same view. ,London's iconic sky line

"May 13, 2019",Would really recommend the London Eye. This was my second time on it and I loved it just as much as the first time. Those in our group who had not been on it before were very impressed. The weather was lovely so the views were great. ,Online tickets 
"May 13, 2019","I was surprised to see that after we bought tickets online (London eye + Tower bridge) that we needed to get the ‘real’ tickets. So we needed to wait in a queue for that, and it took us a lot of time to get back to the Wheel and stand in line again. View is beautiful, must see, but I don’t see the point in buying tickets online (that was cheaper, must admit!), and then getting there and standing in queue to get those bought tickets cause printouts are not valid","Expensive, slow but a must do."
"May 12, 2019",The London Eye is a must do and I'd not a thrill ride but at times it's slowness is boring. It's also expensive.,Didn't do it for me... 
"May 12, 2019","It's one of those things to experience while in London but if you don't enjoy being locked into a small pod with a large group of strangers, find another way to check out the skyline. I used vouchers to drastically reduce the ticket price but had I paid face value I'd have been greatly disappointed. Queues moved faster than I expected to get on and although photos were taken there was no sales pitch. Do be aware that there is an airport style bag search before you get on. ",Good view of the city
"May 11, 2019",Great view of the city but the shard offers much better view and later viewing. The eye has a fast moving line but is hit and miss of who is on your pod. We had a bunch of rude people pushing to get in and off and standing in front of people trying to sit and view. When asked to move completely ignored. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Would not ride again but should do at least once.,Nice way to see London 
"May 10, 2019","We reached on time and thought it was a grey day , London was still beautiful ! The queue moved quickly There’s a Namco arcade nearby , just before sea world where you can spend some time in the warmth and drink a coffee and use free clean loos if you’re early ! Paying extra for the fast track didn’t seem worth it as everything was so smooth and we hardly waited a few minutes I’m not sure I’ll go again for that kind of money but it’s a must do if you haven’t done it at all ",Brilliant
"May 9, 2019","We had to to wait in line for about 15 minutes, but easy to get on and off. What a view of London, we had about 10 people in the pod. Enough space for everyone. It goes very slowly.",A great send off after a month of hard travel.
"May 9, 2019","I’d say it’s overpriced in general, but where else are you going to have an experience like this? The ride is slow enough to not make someone nauseated. The views of the city’s Are fun, but when I was there, a huge amount of construction and renovation was going on. Many buildings had wrap, cranes or scaffolding obscuring them.",Honeymooners! 
"May 9, 2019",Wow!We bought the fast track tickets.This means you don't have to wait in line for a long time.You can purchase fast track tickets online or at the counter.

"May 8, 2019","Amazing experience!! It worth every penny! It has the most beautiful views of London, we certainly recommend!",Definitely worth doing once
"May 8, 2019","Ok-so it’s a little cheesy and it is kind of pricey, but the views are absolutely amazing and it moves slow enough that you have time for lots of selfies, family photos and yes- just to relax for 20 minutes and take in the London skyline!  The lines are always insane for the London Eye (which is why I have passed it up on previous trips) so I do recommend spending the extra few bucks for the skip the line option (we walked right on while there was a huge queue in the regular line).  The capsules are pretty big- even though there are about 20 people in each one- there seemed to be room to mill around and it’s nice that you can do this rain or shine and that this is an accessible view for folks that maybe have limited mobility and can’t climb lots of stairs.  I’m glad we did it once!  I took one star simply because I do think the experience is pricey and it would be nice if they limited the group size of each capsule to the amount of seating available in each one.  Like I said- they are pretty roomy, but there isn’t enough room for everyone to sit on the benches so be prepared to stand.",London Eye

We bought fast track tickets, well worth paying the extra, there wasn't much of a queue when w e arrived but by the end of the ride, the queues were full of school and your groups, it would have taken hours to get through.

"April 29, 2019","If you plan to see and photograph London at night, ride the London eye during autumn or winter season when the nights are longer. We went on the last trip which was 8 pm (23 April) and it was still bright so no nightscape for me to take, plus Big Ben was covered in scaffolding so really nothing interesting that day. The views would've been magnificent if everything was the way I imagined it. Also, buy tickets at the counter and NOT to those men outside the ticketing who are authorized sellers but will also rip you off! ",Eyeing the Sunset...
"April 28, 2019","Timed our ride on the London Eye to coincide with sunset.  We were a few of the fortunate ones for the day we enjoyed this activity, as we were able to catch the ride at sunset and the weather was perfect.  Views all around were nice, making this somewhat of an 'eye-conic' experience.  A bit pricey, but now off my bucket list !",Went with kids
"April 28, 2019","Nice view but very high price to take 2 kids for 30 min ride to see London. The queues were not bad. The photo from London Eye cost me another £20.

"April 26, 2019","Even though supposedly it opens at 10 according to the website, we got on at 915 and I think it was going before that. Fast Pass not only gets you in another (much shorter) line, it also gets you in a car with only other Fast Pass holders. So we had 5 people in our car, while we saw other cars that were packed. ","Great Views, Do the Fast Pass"
"April 25, 2019","The views from the London Eye are fantastic. The car moves so slowly, the motion is almost imperceptible. Also, the car is so big that it doesn't feel crowded. One thing, though: We bought the anytime that day fast pass. It's nearly double the price of a basic ticket, but it's worth every pence. The line for regular ticket holders was so long, the workers had to route it across the walkway and into another holding area. I couldn't even see the whole line until I was up in the Eye. It wouldn't have surprised me if the wait was two hours. We, on the other hand, walked nearly right up to the door, with a total wait time of less than five minutes. So go, but only if you do the fast pass.",Once is enough. I would not repeat this experience.
"April 25, 2019","We went with the family through this experience and it was kind of lame. You get to see some of the famous London sights from above, but overall I was not impressed.",Lovely relaxing time with some stunning views and great photo opportunities.
"April 1, 2019",We went on the eye and it was my husbands first time. We both really enjoyed it! It was relaxing and an all round nice trip. We did buy the photos they took of us and they where nice in a book and some key rings ect. They also had some nice gifts in their shop although we did not buy anything else. I would recommend booking a fast track ticket. We went on a Friday and not in school holidays and the Que was very very long so i can only imagine in the middle of summer or in school holidays.,Fabulous views!
"March 31, 2019","The wait to get tickets was a bit much. The line moved at a slow, steady pace. We purchased tickets at approx. 5:50 PM then decided to visit the washroom before getting in line. When we exited, we were told that the tour ended at 6 PM. The lady who sold us the tickets failed to mention that we had 10 minutes to get on the ride! This is a customer service snafu that must be rectified immediately. After getting our tickets, we were directed to the side for photos (to be sold to us) and a 4-minute video that really served no purpose in relation to the ride. Otherwise, we enjoyed our ride on the London Eye. It goes super slow so there is no rockiness. The views were phenomenal which make for great photo opportunities. As nightfall set on London, the views became more lovely. We were unable to visit the gift shop as it was closed when we exited.",Fun Experience

"March 29, 2019","The Coca-Cola London Eye, according to Wikipedia, “is a cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London.” The article goes on: “It is Europe’s tallest cantilevered observation wheel, is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over 3.75 million visitors annually, and has made many appearances in popular culture.”By the description from Wikipedia, it seemed that my family’s visit to this hopping place was a must. When we were in London, we got on the London Eye, and enjoyed the novelty aspect of the wonderful cantilevered observation wheel that was situated so conveniently close to our hotel. The cantilevered observation wheel is also commonly referred to as a “Ferris wheel.” I believe that is what the kids call it these days anyway.The London Eye is across the River Thames from Big Ben. Unfortunately, at the time of our visit to the UK, Big Ben, which is likely an iconic sight from the cantilevered observation wheel, was under construction. This impeded on our ability to attain full enjoyment of the views of London, but didn’t put so much of a damper on our experience of the cantilevered observation wheel that it was to the extent that it destructed our enjoyment time of the cantilevered observation wheel. There were still many sights to soak in, and the London Eye moves along at a slow enough pace for you to enjoy taking pictures and getting a kick out of the other fun and exciting things to do in a gondola.You should go here.",LOndon Eye
"March 29, 2019",Brilliant. Easy access and boarding. Very smooth ride with no real feeling of moving. Views all around unprecedented.Recommend.,Great day out 
"March 29, 2019",Wonderful day out in london especially on a beautiful sunny day. The views of the city are simply amazing ,Oh what a view!
"March 29, 2019","Oh, what a wonderful view of London of you get from up there! Just wow and open-jaw views! Amazing!And for those who are afraid of highs this might be difficult for to accept, but it moves so slowly that you won't even notice that you are moving. Cabins don't move or shake!! Great experience.",Excellent Views
"March 1, 2019","Excellent views over London on a clear day, can get hot inside the capsules if it’s hot out side, but worth a visit!",Must do experience 
"March 1, 2019","Booked on line, really fast entry. Amazing views especially at or near the top. Great picture opportunities. ",Fantastic
"March 1, 2019",Simply a must! This is a really nice experience that provides a great experience/view of the entire city.,Eye in the sky
"February 27, 2019",The London eye is worth a visit if you have the time ... Subway to westminister station ... Also view the Big Ben it’s under construction yet ... Parliament buildings ... A nice walk  around and lots of good photos ...ENJOY,Half term day out
"February 25, 2019","Lovely day out with half price through o2 was big advantage, que wasn't too bad too for the weekend, my children loves this place with the lovely views and experience.Bought the photos but quite dark.",Buy fast track / get a deal
"February 24, 2019","Queues at half term (3pm) are probably 45 mins long. Regardless of what your ticket says. Buy fast track if you can. We enjoyed it. Probably something you do once. Perhaps do Thames Rockets afterward, or dungeons or Shrek. ",London from the Top
"February 23, 2019","It was an unforgettable experience to see London from above, especially at night. If you want a discounted ticket, you can buy it in advance from travel website. Bear in mind that you will ride the wheel with strangers since the capacity for one capsule is for about 10 people.",Great viewes
"February 23, 2019",I purchased standard tickets through Golden tours. Wheb we arrive the queue was hugr. We upgraded our ticket to the fast line and was totally worth it. We waut for only 5 minutes. The view is amazing. Very romantic if you catch the ride at sunset,Anniversary Champagne Experience
"February 22, 2019",A lovely time and beautiful view!  My kids had sparkling juice instead of Champagne which they enjoyed. A little disappointed our capsule had more people than non-experience capsules but that is just bad luck.,Nice attraction !
"February 21, 2019","I have been several times in London, although seems for me to touristic. But last time I bought a ticket and I must confess : super. Topview. Helpfull staff and very friendly. Fastticket is a must if you hate queing. Desadvantage : very crowdy.","Fab views, worth doing once at least "
"April 6, 2019",I think once you’ve been on the London eye once you wouldn’t do it again but it’s worth going on to see some spectacular views of London. We did the champagne ride. Would recommend!,Amazing! 
"April 5, 2019","Great views, the line moves fast and it is a great experience! I would recommend this as a great addition to anyone’s day out in London! ",First time visit 
"April 4, 2019","Booked online with river boat cruse, best way to do it as you save money booking multiple items than turning up on day. Really enjoyed the experience and even though im scared of height i felt very comfortable due to size of pods and goes slowly around. Close to some bars, restaurants and tube station. Since ive done it i don't think would do again but did enjoy. Only issue was the queue, had to wait 45min to get into proper queue, then took another 35min to get onto ride but i suppose it was a Sat and good weather.  If youve not been you must try it ",A must. 
"April 4, 2019",If you’re in London then you need to do this. It’s that simple. Great thing to do first as it gives you an idea of where everything is and what direction you need to be heading in for other sights. ,Perfect view but with its faults
"April 4, 2019","Well the view you cant fault, it is what it is. It was a lovely experiance and my 4 year old really enjoyed it. We are annual pass holders so pre booked our time slot although we shouldnt have bothered. There is a reason Merlin will be 2nd in the world to disney ... customer service. The staff were not very friendly, rude at times and there was an element of not knowing what they were doing. We travelled with a newborn and I would say it was less than family friendly. I was rudly told I couldnt take the baby on in the buggy ... it was health and safety and space apparently. I was happy to take the baby out which i did. They wanted me to take the buggy apart, at the same time as trying to board a pod and hold a baby and keep an eye on a 4 year old. There was little help offered. They said it was about space but did not understand me when i said that putting it down will take up double the space as it came in 2 parts ... hence we took up 2 lots of buggy space in the pod. Again there was no help offered when getting off ... I was trying to put the buggy back together without droppung baby and was told I needed to do it behind the line!",Trip to London  for sightseeing
"April 3, 2019","On a beautiful sunny day, our flight on the London Eye gave us spectacular views of the whole of the London panorama. Smooth ride, well organised, clean pods. Advisable to book beforehand as it is very popular.",Still in maintenance
"April 2, 2019",Will have to go back another time :( great scenery at night with it’s lights though. Too bad I couldn’t get on.,Lovely relaxing time with some stunning views and great photo opportunities.
"April 1, 2019",We went on the eye and it was my husbands first time. We both really enjoyed it! It was relaxing and an all round nice trip. We did buy the photos they took of us and they where nice in a book and some key rings ect. They also had some nice gifts in their shop although we did not buy anything else. I would recommend booking a fast track ticket. We went on a Friday and not in school holidays and the Que was very very long so i can only imagine in the middle of summer or in school holidays.,Fabulous views!
"March 31, 2019","The wait to get tickets was a bit much. The line moved at a slow, steady pace. We purchased tickets at approx. 5:50 PM then decided to visit the washroom before getting in line. When we exited, we were told that the tour ended at 6 PM. The lady who sold us the tickets failed to mention that we had 10 minutes to get on the ride! This is a customer service snafu that must be rectified immediately. After getting our tickets, we were directed to the side for photos (to be sold to us) and a 4-minute video that really served no purpose in relation to the ride. Otherwise, we enjoyed our ride on the London Eye. It goes super slow so there is no rockiness. The views were phenomenal which make for great photo opportunities. As nightfall set on London, the views became more lovely. We were unable to visit the gift shop as it was closed when we exited.",Fun Experience
"March 31, 2019","I was a little concerned about going up in the Eye, but I really enjoyed the views and the comfort from the air conditioned pods. It was a nice relaxing experience.",Evening Visit to see the Christmas Lights
"January 1, 2022","I have done the eye several times, but always in the day and during warmer weather.  Wanted to see London at night. It was spectacular.  We'd book the last time of the day, but arrived early and were allowed on without any problem. Shared our pod with 4 other adults and 3 children. It was very comfortable and safe. Lovely ride as always. And beautiful views across London. ",Vicky a great guide!
"December 30, 2021",Such a great way to see the city and so many amazing stories of landmark buildings! Vicky the tour guide was excellent and full of enthusiasm! Couldn’t recommend more!!,"Jordan if you’re single, call me"
"December 30, 2021","The London Eye River Cruise was amazing. Highly recommend if you are visiting London. Also, Jordan was  phenomenal. He was a great tour guide and had me laughing the entire time.",Great day out in London
"December 30, 2021",-tickets was easy to book -the waiting queue was fast didn’t have to wait long -great experience overall,Worth every penny
"December 30, 2021","Lived in London for 20 years and this is the first river cruise I have ever done. Absolutely loved it, our guide, Jordan, was great, the perfect mix of informative and entertaining and our 6year old loved it. I'd heartily reccomend this for Londoners and Tourists alike.",Wonderful overall experience
"December 29, 2021",Amazing day out there the wasn’t that long as I have herd people moaning about before although we had booked online only took about 8 minutes of que time the views were wonderful and the pods were I think very well designed for comfort including having places to sit you also have your picture taken there as well which is nice overall had great time and when to the nearby Wagamama restaurant after on the south bank I would highly recommend if you are in London good luck 😃,Not to be missed!
"December 29, 2021",Fantastic trip for adults and kids!Jordan was knowledgeable and really funny too - highly recommended and really affordable. Thank you !,Great view of urban London
"December 28, 2021","London eye has a very amazing view looking down at the river Thames, I certainly do recommend it very much as it’s one of the most iconic and beautiful place to look down at the city London . Though may get boring if ride a lot of times",Highly recommended!
"December 28, 2021",Prefect opportunity to see an aerial view of London. Highly recommend to anyone who is visiting London for the first time!,London Eye River Cruise-A MUST!
"December 28, 2021",The London Eye was a unique experience. Being up so high gives you a breathtaking and memorable view of London from the River Thames. The best part of my trip was the London Eye River Cruise. Jordan our tour guide had the right amount of humour to give me a taste of London's history with a pinch of laughter. Thanks Jordan! I thoroughly enjoyed the tour. I recommend this trip to anyone who wants to see London via the south bank in a few hours. Tip:  Bring an umbrella. A downpour of rain is possible at any time.,So cool!
"January 6, 2019",What a great way to see London!  We went first thing in the morning and bought a fast track ticket.  No line at all!!  It was great.  Such incredible views.  ,London eye new year eve 
"January 5, 2019","Amazing , nothing better , watching the fire works for the new year there You need to reserve a place by a ticket , the white area was amazing 10 pound , u need to be there from 8 pm , riding it is very amazing experience preferred in the morning where u can see the whole London , Big Ben , Houses of Parliament, Palace of Westminster, and the old palace yard You need to take the bridge to the other side in order to have your own facebook profile pic  ",amazing panoramic view of the city
"January 4, 2019",worth itamazing panormaice view of Londonnot much queue we waited 10 15mnpossibility to buy tickets online,Champagne experience
"January 3, 2019","If you decide to do the London Eye, please do the Champagne Experience. For a couple of pounds more you have the same magnificent view, but NO waiting lines AND a glass of champagne. You can wait in a nice lounge with music, where you can order drinks at the bar (also non-alcoholic). A host picks you up and brings you to the attraction and via the express line within 5 minutes you are enjoying a great view of London...",Fancy big wheel
"January 3, 2019",Its a good big wheel. Some good views when you get to the top. They do pack the pods though so struggle for a good view when everyone is trying to get to the same window.,Best experience ever
"January 2, 2019","TBH, you've not experienced London if you haven't taken a ride in the  London Eye. The cityscape comes alive, making you feel literally on top of the world! ",Great Experience 
"December 31, 2018",Massive in size and scope. Tremendous views of the city. It moves slow enough to enjoy the 360 degree views but not so fast that you would miss anything.,Birds eye view
"December 31, 2018",Came here on a family trip in the past few days but we did it in the day time. We did find that some staff told us different answers to our questions. Told to join the quenue half hour before our timed booking as we had booked the boat trip. So we ended up doing the boat trip first as couldn't change the booking. Good views. We didn't both the buy the photos taken inside the pods as other people stood in front of us much to the upset of the  little one with us! Thankfully we took our own photos..,VIP champagne experience 
"December 31, 2018","Overall it was an amazing experience!We had a tour guide Kimi that was so polite, informative and willing to help us / answer any questions.I would highly suggest that kids should NOT be allowed to do this experience!! We had 5 children in our group who were running around and acting up. I know for a fact that I wasn’t the only person to think that kids shouldn’t be allowed as I got talking with a few other adults. Perhaps children under the age of 14?To be honest, I think getting the fast track option and booking tickets online massively helps as the queues were wild!! ",Great views of London
"December 30, 2018","Although the overall experience is great, price is a bit too expensive.Worth doing if you have enough time and good budget, otherwise there is much more to do for free in London.",Great 
"February 11, 2019","Staff great, very quick queues all very well managed. Views overlooking London are worth seeing, it takes about 40 mins roughly. We went on a cloudy day & the views were still very good :) would recommend as something fun to do! ",Weather important
"February 11, 2019","I have been on the London Eye several times. That last was with my granddaughters who were thrilled. Pointless on a dull rainy day, bonus is clear skies.Over priced though.",Family trip to London
"February 10, 2019",Kids very excited and the parents a whole in the wallet. Very expensive 30 minutes for a view of London,Something I always wanted to do 
"February 9, 2019","A little anticlimactic, but all in all worth it. I didn't have to wait long even though I didn't have the fast track. ",Worth doing once. 
"February 7, 2019","The London Eye provides some nice views and I am pleased we have done it, but it is very expensive for what it is, even with concession tickets! If you have the time and money then do go, otherwise, enjoy some of the many other activities London has to offer! ",A must do in London. 
"February 6, 2019","My 2nd time of going on the London eye, and it’s still amazing. Went to the 4d cinema before. That was only 5-10 mins but well worth it, then onto the London eye.  No queues due to the time of year, and spectacular views of the Thames and London with some amazing photo opportunities. Think I was on there approx 20 mins, but it felt like ages. ",Waste of time
"February 5, 2019",Waste of time. Too short a ride. You are only high up for a brief time. Too expensive for what it is.,Great experience
"February 3, 2019","The London Eye is a must when visiting London. We booked and paid for our tickets online and arrived at around 9:30am ready for when the London Eye first opened. We weren’t queuing for very long which was great. The views were amazing and it taken around 25-30 minutes to go all the way around. I wouldn’t go again because it think it’s one of those things where once you have done it, you’ve done it though I do think it’s worth doing at least once when in London.",Great experience 
"January 27, 2019",Great experience on the London eye. Would recommend the £2 programme to get an idea of what you are looking at when up there!!! The 4d cinema experience was also good. We went fast track and only queued for15 mins on a Saturday. ,Night visit
"January 26, 2019","I visited the London Eye in the summer by day and then in the fall by night. Really enjoyed the night vision with its lovely colours, the busy streets full of tourists!",Beautiful view...but not sure its worth the wait.
"December 16, 2018","Amazing views when at the very top!!! however not sure it was totally worth it. The line for peopole with tickets was about 2 hours!! Also the views on the way up are just ok. Although the view up top is beautiful, its only there for a few mins making it really hard to grab a picture, especially when theres also 20 or so other people trying to do the same.",Eye eye!
"December 16, 2018","The Eyes have it! Fabulous for a birds eye over London and enjoying all that goes with it, turkey wonderful!!!",Waste Of Time - SKIP!
"December 16, 2018",This was a royal (pun intended) waste of time and money. The view is 'meh' and the price is ridiculous. You have to SHARE your cab with strangers.,Great view
"December 13, 2018",It is a bit of a tourist trap but something you will kick yourself if you don't visit while in London. The tickets are not cheap but the view is great. Don't worry about a swinging gondola. It is rock steady and takes about a half hour to go around. The gondolas are completely enclosed so there is no wind to worry about.,Lovely views
"December 12, 2018","Did a sunset trip to the London Eye. Used priority tickets which is well worth it especially since:1. The queues are busier in December as well as around sunset2. We had a 2 year old daughter and so wouldn't manage a long queue very well.If you don't mind the wait then standard tickets are fine. The view was lovely. You spend enough time up there and the capsules are not overcrowded. Definitely a must do for London but once it's done, that's it. No need for repeats unlike other London attractions eg. The museums","Expensive, rude staff but nice view "
"December 11, 2018","The staff wasn’t very friendly, we had tickets and there was a staring line so we joined the line, as the boys who checked the tickets were sure we tried to skip the line ( there was no line except constantly walking people everywhere) he told us to go to the back of the line, because of the discussion now there was a line and he wanted us to go to the back. As we were waiting with our four year old this wasn’t very pleasant. But we didn’t had a choice as they both were very rude. But hey, there’s only one London eye so maybe they think they’re allowed to treat people like that. Wouldn’t go back soon. ",London Eye by night and rain
"December 11, 2018","Worth buying the ticket online to skip the queue, though the queue is still quite long. It was an evening ride under the pouring rain of London, but it was still a very nice experience. Pure tourist attraction.",Fantastic
"December 11, 2018",It is very interesting to ride in London eye. One can see from top city view. It takes hours to get turn. Staff is very polite and gives information if asked. Eye is very neat and clean.,Learn to identify the skyline
"December 10, 2018","this is a slow ride, so dont see it as a fairground trip-it is for viewing the skyline of a very old city, with lots of easerly identifiable buildings if you know what you are looking at. I took an American friend and as a Londoner, I was able to point out what could be seen. On a clear day, you can see as far as Hampstead Heath. Great for tourists, children may not appreciate it unless they like buildings as their is no commentary. Look out for combined tickets and be aware queues can be long as the ride is very slow, but the pods are large and can take a few people, but you are not squashed in.",Short trip
"December 10, 2018","Great fun.. Helpful Staff...Obviously too enjoy this it helps if the weather is good...Fantastic View, definately Worte a visit....",Not suitable for families particularly pregnant mothers and young children
"November 27, 2018","We booked the VIP experience for my father's 60th. I am 7 months pregnant and we picked the VIP package so that I could rest my feet and enjoy the experience without having to endure the queues. We also had an autistic toddler in our party and hoped time in the VIP lounge would keep him nice and calm before boarding our capsule. Because the VIP lounge doesn't offer meals (which is understandable) my husband went down stairs to buy me a pie to share with the toddler. Whilst eating the pie with my nephew a waitress came and said you are not allowed to eat in here.My sister reasoned that this is a child and a pregnant woman and we booked the lounge specifically give us a chance to recuperate.Furthermore the fact that there were no signs to state the no eating rule, it felt unfair to suddenly inform us of this. I was forced to go downstairs where there was no seating and had to eat standing.Not the kind of treatment you expect for a pregnant woman and toddler.",Touristy for sure but...
"November 26, 2018","We had a great time on our trip around the London Eye.  It is an expensive endeavor for a family to undertake but the views really are stunning. We skipped the expensive novelty photos which helped to cut down on cost. It felt like they were trying to upsell us the whole time we were there on everything from food to photos to souvenirs.  If you have time and money to burn, we felt that it was a fun way to view London…",Wonderful way to get out of the cold and see London!
"November 26, 2018","We recently traveled to London for the first time last week. It was a cold & rainy day, so what better than to get out of the elements and see the city. We all loved the London Eye experience. There was no waiting and only us and another family of 3 in the ""pod"" with us. Eventhough it was cloudy and gloomy, we still have lovely views of the city. We wouldn've have loved seeing it at night, as well. Such a lovely attraction and worth the money! PS...the Hot Whiskey cart outside of the entrance, is amazing! A perfect & delicious way to warm up!",Great experience and views at a value
"November 25, 2018",If you have little ones and want to go here and some other places around the area. I suggest going to the site and booking online. We got a great deal on tickets for this and the sea life center. We also got great views of the city. Same as most things get here before noon if you want to avoid huge lines. Even on a cloudy day we were able to see pretty far. Our son hates Ferris wheels but he didn’t mind this one because it’s enclosed and it goes really slow.,Good
"November 25, 2018",It was like it should be. Fast lane in November not necessary. Good view over Westminster. Combine with others like Madame Tussaud's.,My husbands favorite
"November 21, 2018","Skipping the line was worth it, as the waiting line was way too long when we arrived. Also if the ride could be a bit longer, we fully enjoyed the time in here. The view over the center of London was just wow. Especially as we arrived when the sun was going down. The capsule wasn't too crowded, which was important to have the chance to see as much as possible. One of our top to-do things in London",Good for views across London
"November 21, 2018",Not a lot to review - you go round and round getting decent views of London - not especially exciting and not cheap of what you get- at busy times you can queue for hours and there are better ways of spending your time and money in London and ,Weekend relaxing 
"November 18, 2018",It's very big and you can see the whole centre of London. It's must visit and go have a try. It's very good to take pictures all around and unike place. I'd recommend to anyone 👍,Not worth the cost
"November 18, 2018","Excellent facility but hugely overpriced. Check to see if you’re eligible for a discount: nhs, student, etc.The crowd queuing system is a shambles, in need of restructuring. Once in the capsule, it’s great to see London and it’s beautiful landmarks. We went on around 4pm - up in daylight, down in the dark! Wonderful!",Waste of time and money 
"November 16, 2018","Everyone visiting London want to do this. And I think almost everyone wonders why they did it. Or at-least the ones that were with me in the ‘eye’. It’s bloody boring and the views aren’t that great either. I still wonder why, why, why I paid for this. Avoid. ",Must-go!
"November 4, 2018","Amazing views of London from here. It is definitely a must-visit! We really enjoyed it, it was slow enough to enjoy the views and yet, time flew!",Nice trip! 
"November 2, 2018",We visited the London Eye having booked our tickets on line but the queue we had to stand in was so long we didn’t get on the Eye until one hour later. However the views are fantastic and it remains not too commercially focussed with the pod remaining an easy place to navigate and the views are uninhibited as well. I had been on the Eye before but it didn’t disappoint.  My advice would be even if booking on line expect to spend st least 30-60 minutes queuing ,Great view of the city 
"November 1, 2018","A little pricey for a family, but great panoramic views of all of London’s beauty. Paying for the fast track ticket in advance is well worth cutting down on wait times. Kids loved it.  ",Just do it
"November 1, 2018",Been on this twice and it does not disappoint. Both my children loved it. There's a shop on your way round it and when we stopped to get a drink people pushed on ahead in the line that was the only annoying part as the shop is part of the line. ,A must do!
"October 29, 2018","Let me preface this by saying I went on the eye with my mom two years ago and said I would never do it again. I just recently brought my husband to London and felt I had to take him on this. We bought the champagne experience tickets and I would do it again in a heartbeat. The group size in the capsule was much smaller doing it with the experience. Also, we got in the fast pass line. Worth the extra money, and also great to do a night/sunset!",Not really worth the money
"October 29, 2018","Both my daughter and I agreed that this was an OK think to do in London. It's expensive, the lines are long, and the view is not really all that spectacular.  ",Beautiful 
"October 26, 2018","Nice , nice , nice. A must see in London. Very good atmosphere! If you plan on getting on the London eye— it’s best to purchase in advance !!! The lines are long!!!!!!!!! Very. Ice views - I enjoyed the night views !! ",Overpriced must do
"October 25, 2018",The queue system was a little confusing but it did go down quick. I think the price is a little expensive for what it is but it’s a must do attraction when you visit London. ,Check Before Getting an Express Pass
"October 25, 2018",Check with staff if you actually need an Express pass. There is no point if the lines are short to buy tickets.Would be nice if they could do more for keeping the glass clean.,Insane queues and pickpockets love this area
"October 25, 2018",A group of 4 can have a 30 minute helicopter flight over the city for the same price - need I say more,Too expensive
"September 26, 2018",On a clear day you can see all of London. But for the cost it just wasn’t worth it. Go to the walkie talkie building and go to the roof top garden for free. ,You can not miss it
"September 25, 2018",The London eye is massive. You can not miss it as you see it from everywhere along the river. It's a memory you will never forget.,Great views of London
"September 25, 2018","The Eye is a very nice way to see the setting sun in London.  Each capsule holds around 12 people, but it was still spacious to get many pictures.",Avoid in poor weather
"September 24, 2018","There is a lot of hype about the London Eye, but really it doesn't live up to it and it is very expensive. You don't get much out of a second visit and if the weather is poor and visibility reduced it may feel a waste of time.","Great, but expensive "
"September 22, 2018","Fabulous views of London, and a great opportunity to point out different landmarks and historical places to my children. The price, for 30 minutes entertainment, is too high. We got a discount for traveling there by train, but £27 for an adult and £22 per child is crazy. Also, they took a souvenir photo before getting on the ride, but at the end we discovered that only the tops of my children’s heads were visible! I would have expected them to know how to adjust the lens to capture children!",Mark is the best !!
"September 22, 2018","The cruise in itself is fun, but with Mark’s (tour guide) comments, it brings the experience to a whole new level ! ",The views can't be beaten elsewhere
"September 19, 2018","Ok, totally touristy but so worth the fantastic view on London. I would opt to do this around sunset so that you can see the city lights popping up under a sunset sky.",Something you need to do
"October 2, 2018",This is just one of those things you need to do in London.  The Eye is one of those attractions that during the approximately 30-minute ride will all you to view a good amount of London and a pace that seems like you are barely moving.  There is a bench in the middle of each car if you are concerned about dealing with the height.  There is so much to do around the Eye.  Take advantage of it.,London Eye experience
"October 2, 2018","Early evening tickets were purchased for my family of  5 (including my son-in-law) on our last day of a 5 day trip.  It was so worth seeing an elevated view of many of the places we had visited the past 5 days!  A little pricey, but worth the experience.",See the expansive London metropolis
"October 2, 2018",This was well worth it. A bit crowded but they move everyone along.  Got some great pics of the Thames and other landmarks with friends in the foregrounds.  Do it--it was memorable.  but once is enough,Another must go in london
"October 2, 2018",The only thing that can ruin this nice experience is waiting in queues to buy the tickets. Go for the fast track way,Ask for Marian
"September 18, 2018","We booked the champagne experience / fast track. It was strange as we could not claim our ticket by the machines which were very fast, we had to queue up by the vip desk which took ages due a difficult client, and due the fact that only one person worked, the other was socialising and entertaining a group of young girls.We have been advised to go to the lounge and wait for the hostess to come. The lounge is very small and it was very uncomfortable for us as there was a large wedding party and we were just sitting in the corner in our “normal clothes” the drink menu is rather pricy as well, so I would rather skip this bit if we return.Our hostess Marian was amazing, very bubbly but not over the top, very knowledgable and lovely personality. She couldn’t do enough for us when it came to photographs, answering questions and so on. On our tour we had 17 people in our group which was fine, wasn’t too crowded and we had great opportunities to make photos.",Rode the London Eye
"September 17, 2018",Perfect day weather wise so I rode the eye.  Surprised it was only £27 for an adult ride.  Only a 10 min wait to get on.  Ride took about 20-25 min.  Great views if the weather is good.  Come early.  No lines right at 10am.  ,Sightseeing
"September 16, 2018",Take patience with you the ticket lines are long but goes very quickly.the ride give an awesome city view of London and its historic beauty restaurant and rest room's are close.,"Go early, but Go"
"October 2, 2018","Amazing, easy for all ages, spectacular, and worth the price. We have priceless pictures and the overview was breathtaking! ",Perfect view of London
"October 1, 2018","We are afraid of heights but this was a fantastic experience ! The best advice is to get a fast track ticket , the wait was manageable for us as we are seniors . The views were super and we could sit and enjoy the sights .",rainy day
"September 30, 2018","the day i went there was a rainy day, even that we enjoyed the round.. it was amazing, just sad the the big ben was covered for maintenance (i think 5 years starting 2016 or 2017)",Meh 
"September 29, 2018",It was disappointing.  I thought it would have been a better experience. Not worth the time or money. ,A view over London
"September 27, 2018",Decided to do the London Eye and reserved together with Madame Tussauds for a discount which is 11 £ so do it. Overall nice view over London. But I expected more.,Pod on top of London
"September 26, 2018","Even thought the ticket is pricy, you really have quite the serene views of the city. The line is long but moves quickly. Each pod is rather large, temperature controlled and has plenty of room to sit or stand. The trip around is about half an hour. Around the area there is a gift store, ice cream store and vendors.",Great views on a sunny day
"October 14, 2018",Worth seeing.  Very busy but if you want spend the money for the fast track ticket.  We didn't see the other sites associated with it.  Well organized.,Excellent experience
"October 11, 2018","We simply walked up and there was no wait. however, in hindsight, I wish we purchased tickets in advance for a reduced price. Still worth it!",Beautiful view of London!
"October 11, 2018","The London eye was a fun family adventure to go on! It’s about 30 minutes to see the views of the London skyline... and, it’s very pretty. Would recommend for families to do!",London eye
"October 8, 2018","Smashing experiance with great views even in the rain. Large queue for tickets in ticket office, but you do get on to the eye very quickly. ",Go after sunset to avoid the crowds
"October 7, 2018",We had a gift card to use for the London eye and originally went during the day - however we found the pods were fairly full and the queues were long - so we decide to book a time slot in the evening so we could enjoy a view overlooking London when it  is lit up beautifully! And it was definitely worth the wait - our pod only had me and my partner and one other couple in it so we weren’t all trying to get the best spot. Going in the evening is perfect for anybody who would like to go on the London eye and experience this attraction who has already already enjoyed a view overlooking London already (a free option is to visit the Sky Garden),Disappointed & Insulted
"October 5, 2018","We booked online for the Eye and from the start were disappointed with the whole experience. First, the staff insisted on a printed ticket which we were unable to supply as we were travelling from overseas and staying in an apartment with no printing facilities. We were directed by staff to what seemed the 'usual' place people in our situation were sent about a 1/2 km away to then pay a further £3 to have the ticket printed. Once we returned to the line, we were then told by another attendant that we were in the wrong line for the ticket type we had and had to join another queue! Once we got on the Eye we were further disappointed by the lack of commentary and/or signage in the capsule pointing out the landmarks. The capsules contained no information other than Coca Cola signage and we were then insulted with the request at the end to stand in the Photo zone and ""don't forget to smile"" in order to take another photo to sell to us!  I would not recommend the London Eye to anyone - it is not worth the money and hassle. You can get as good, if not better views, from other areas of the city for free without the insults.",London view!
"October 5, 2018",It’s a nice way to have a view from above of the whole London. The wheel is moving slowly so you have enough time to enjoy and see the view!,London Eye - negotiate with someone in the next pod to exchange photos!
"October 3, 2018","We were quickly on-board. It's a marvellous piece of engineering. The pods stay on the outside at all times - cool!After some sign language with a couple in the next pod, we took some photos of them in their pod, then exchanged them when back on the ground.",Nice view and cool engineering
"October 2, 2018","While not a cheap 20 minute ride it is a great view and the structure is quite impressive.  I’m not sure it is a “don’t miss” in London as there are other view options such as the Shard or restaurants in the shard, but not a waste of time.",Good Idea
"October 2, 2018",This line for the London Eye can be quite long.  It was worth the effort ($) to get the ticket to avoid spending time in line,EASY AND CONVENIENT  WAY TO GENTLY HOVER ABOVE THE SIGHTS OF LONDON
"September 5, 2018",The slow turn of this giant wheel with its dangling glass gondolas is the perfect way to hover above the Thames  with delightful views of some of London's most famous sites. If you can time it for just after sunset with a dark blue sky and the building and street lights coming on its a magical flight.,Dissatisfied 
"September 5, 2018",Had a wedding gift of the vip experience for our honeymoon. Booking was for 6pm. Arrived at 5.40pm in the eye lounge only to be told we can't have a drink because the bar closes at 5.30. What's the point if vip experience goes on after 5.30? Disappointing. ,Good Experience 
"September 2, 2018",It was a great experience. If it’s your first time to visit London I think it’s a good idea to visit London eye.,Fun fun fun! 
"September 1, 2018",The London Eye was so fun. You can see the entire City. The ride is about 30 minutes. We absolutely loved it! ,best view of the city you can get
"August 30, 2018","Buy your tickets ahead of time. You still have a wait in line but not as long as if you don't. The compartments are large and completely Murano glass, with benches to sit on as you go around. There are 4 stations in each compartment with info on each of the changing landmarks you can see from the compartment as it turns. Totally worth doing.",Spectacular views of the city
"August 28, 2018","Visited with relatives from overseas. We booked online in advance and arrived about 15 minutes before we were due to go up.  After a short wait we were able to join the queue which moved quite fast despite it being a very busy Saturday in July.  The capsules are large and airy and they move slightly Way enough that there is plenty of opportunity to move around and see the views in different directions.  It would be nice if there were information boards in the capsules to tell you what you are seeing but there was nothing.  The views are spectacular and fortunately we know enough of London to point out most major landmarks.  After the trip on he Eye we went inside the visitor centre to see the 4D film.  I was a little disappointed that you had to stand for this as we'd been on our feet for quite a few hours by this point.  The film is quite good but not a major selling point in my opinion.  This is a must do attraction for visitors who don't come to London often - probably best dine near the start of a holiday to help you get your bearings.  Like all Merlin attractions, you have to exit via the gift shop and photos are pushed upon you at every opportunity but it is easy enough to say no.",What a View
"August 28, 2018","Took a ride on the London Eye, what a spectacular view you get of London from the top of the ride.  The queue is quite long depending on when you go but does move at a fast pace as each pod holds about 30 persons.If you ticket is purchased by a Tour Company (ie Caledonian Tours, etc.) for the London Eye, London Eye River Cruise and Mde Tussauds you cannot book you times for the Cruise or Mde Tussauds on the Internet site but have to do it at the booking offices. Mde Tussauds can be booked at the London Eye office but don't stand in the standard ticket line use fast track or line at the end for booking Merlin Pass times",Round and round we go
"August 27, 2018",This is my 2nd trip on the eye and it really is an experience to be had. The queues aren't too long. I think the price is a bit much BUT you can get 2 for 1 and there are offers online to be found. I was a bit disappointed that the tablets had been removed since my last visit so remember to buy a 360 viewing map before going on. This is a really good piece of kit as otherwise (especially tourists) you will not know what you are looking at. The ride doesn't last too long but definately long enough for you to look at everything. It's a shame they have built some taller building right near it as this blocks the view of the shard. The gift shop is quite reasonable value for money and a good variety of items too. ,A must do and the kids will love it!
"August 26, 2018","Such a fun experience and it takes about 20 minutes to go all the way around and you get views of the city that are just breathtaking.... lots of places to take family photos, etc. ",Views
"August 23, 2018","Great view of the city on a clear day, but if you are visiting London for the first time, it is definitely worthwhile.",Great experience!
"August 23, 2018","Think we got lucky with this one. Got a great price for 3 of us through the O2 Priority app. Passed it around 1.30 and queues were massive (August 22nd), came back 3.45pm and virtually walked straight on in 5 minutes. The views are just amazing and my granddaughter loved seeing Big Ben from this angle. ",Over rated 
"August 22, 2018","Glad I did the London eye but found it overpriced overrated with too complicated a system for getting on. The queue to buy tickets was very slow and customers around us bad tempered and using inappropriate language. People constantly queue jumping for getting tickets and to get onto eye. staff not very helpful and quite dismissive. Generally London and it’s attractions are well signed, except this. There are self service ticket kiosks which staff didn’t mention and we found by accident that were standing empty - this was after leaving the queue listening to foul language, on way to toilet we spied them. We had our tickets in a few minutes, we met up with others that had continued to queue for a further 90 minutes - we had been on eye and had a bite to eat.View is beautiful but disappointed in the experience. TOP TIP - Use the ticket machines on the right when you go in.",Nice westminister view and overall London
"August 21, 2018","We paid more to get an express tickets ; it was worth it to skip the long lines , even we were visiting in January.  Ice view from top",Super Rhona
"August 27, 2018","When you pay only £41 pp and end up with only the two of you in a cabin, you know you kinda won the lottery!We enrolled for the Champaign Experience and we were so lucky to have Rhona as our host! This smart and funny young woman explained us what we were looking at from the sky, combining facts with humour.The champaign (Pommery) was very good, the view was nice, the weather was okay.To be recommended!",Get the fast track
"August 27, 2018","We are glad to have purchased the fast track pass. The queues for the standard ticket holders were very long. We got in line and were immediately placed in a pod. The ride takes about 20 minutes. The views of the city were okay. Maybe the views are more enjoyable if viewed at night. It's worth doing for photo ops, but otherwise a little boring.",Super visit
"August 27, 2018","Had a super trip to London eye. Great experience, organised queues, friendly staff and security spot on. Lovely views of london. Kids loved it and smiled all the way thru",Great views of Central London
"August 20, 2018",The ride takes about 30 minutes. HIGHLY recommend the fast pass during peak times. Night views are excellent.,Great views on a sunny day
"August 20, 2018",Get your tickets in advance to avoid queuing. It doesn't go round very fast and last about 30 mins. On a sunny day you get great views across the London and I recommend trying to go on at sunset - stunning! I've given 1-2 hours for the total visit as the queues can get quite long!,Early evening ride 14th August
"August 19, 2018","We took a ride at 7pm which was perfect time.Most importantly your ticket has a time, if fast track can arrive 5 minutes before and ok those not fast track need to be at least 30 minutes before to queue .",Book in Advance and go on a weekday
"August 18, 2018","I would highly recommend the London eye! I went with my best friend and we thoroughly enjoyed it. She lives in London and was the one who said to me that we needed to book. I did not manage to book the 2-for-1 as we didn’t quite understand the process with train tickets and things? We paid 48£ for two.The staff are well organised there and the line moved at a decent pace. It seemed there was also some kind of ticket you could buy which meant you could wait in a shorter line, but it didn’t make too much of a difference, although we did go on a week day. Make sure you have your ticket on your phone or printed out and they will scan it. The attraction I would say took about 30 minutes to go around. There are some really great views and I’d highly recommend , especially in the weekdays when it is less busy as we passed by on a Saturday and it was absolutely rammed!","Expensive alone, buy a combo ticket"
"July 25, 2018","A really nice experience and great way to view the London City skyline.  It is best value to buy online, get a priority ticket, reserve your time, plus combine it with another site you want to see (we combined with Madame Tussaud’s).  There is a lot of construction going on and one might be concerned that the view towards, London Bridge will soon be totally obscured, but the views of Westminster will still and always be there.  It’s a bit if a more interesting way to see London from up above than simply going to the top of a building.  ",Eye-spy With My London Eye ......
"July 25, 2018","My husband organised this visit to London for us on a gorgeously hot Saturday. We were most impressed with the organisational skills of the staff on the day. Yes, there were queues, but the timescales which were communicated were true to time. Good to know if, like us, you have other organised time activity slots.The view over London is spectacular, the rotation lasts approximately half an hour, lots of space to stand or sit and take in the sight-seeing views.",Unforgettable experience
"July 24, 2018",Amazing views of London Town.The capsule wasn't at all cramped so plenty of room for viewing the sights and photo taking.Can get very busy so get in early.,Over rated not worth the money 
"July 24, 2018",Wouldn’t rush back to this . It was mediocre at best and boring at worst. It would have been helpful for an audio guide to talk through London skyline . Que system was a joke . If you are limited in time / money give this attraction a miss .,Very smooth experience
"July 24, 2018","We went right at dinnertime on a Monday, so perhaps that was a good time to go, but the line didn't look hours long at all. I paid for FastTrack, however, and it seemed well worth it as we were on a pod within 10 minutes easy. The view is fabulous (I just wish the glass had been a bit cleaner, though I suppose that's difficult in a place where it rains nearly every day). The ride is so smooth that sometimes I didn't even know we were moving unless I looked at the ground or the center.",Must do
"July 23, 2018","It’s the London Eye!  Just one of those things you have to do.  We bought tickets a couple of days prior in the ticket office.  Our timed entrance began at 10:30 and we could get on any time until 7:30pm.  We got there at 11:30, and waited in line maybe 10-15 min, not bad.  It moved fast.  Time on was 27 minutes.  Great views, capsules are air conditioned.  Experience is exactly what you’d expect.  ",The London Eye is cool. 
"July 20, 2018","Lines, shuffles to get the spot you want in the car, and the random 20 people you can be stuck with all prejudice this attraction. However the one thing that stands clear is the need to visit it and ride the Eye. It has great views, and you a look at history from the air!",Nice but too expensive 
"July 16, 2018","The view is awesome but the price you pay isn’t worth. We paid for the fast track ticket in advance and the normal line was fast, so for us it was a lost of money ",Easy access and effecient
"July 15, 2018","Bought tickets online in the US before arriving in London.  Very easy website to navigate. On arrival, just showed our tickets right at the gate and we were on board in less than 5 minutes",Great view
"July 15, 2018","We went up on the London Eye. It would have been nicer if they wouldn’t have put so many people in each pod. The “photo glass panels” are only on one side of the pod so the photos you take from the other side through the “normal glass” aren’t as clear.It is nice to see the city from so far above it.Tip: buy your tickets ahead of time online and make sure you specify you want the “fast lane” ones so that when you get there you can be ushered through a quicker, shorter line and not have to wait through the normal (very long line.)",Excellent
"July 14, 2018","We had to tickets for 6pm and joined the queue at 5.30 under the instructions from a London eye rep. The queue was huge, snaking beyond the ticket office entrance.The queue moved fast and we were on our pod at 6pm, the allotted time. The views were gorgeous and the expert was excellent. The pods hold about 20, we were on the queue with school kids but were put in a pod with tourists which was better. The pod is beautifully air conditioned, it doesn't stop to let you on but moves so slowly it's life hopping onto an escalator.The green screen photos were good, definitely have a look at themLast tip, book online and select a combo with another attraction.",Amazing views
"July 13, 2018","We were pretty lucky in that the line wasn't too long, and the time we did spend in line was worth it, in my opinion. The views are amazing and if you or your guests are only in London for a short time, this is probably one of the best ways to see the city because you can clearly see nearly all of the major landmarks in one go from above. Don't forget your camera!",Jump the line
"July 12, 2018","We purchased the fast track ""Jump the line"" tickets, and thank heavens for that: We got in straight away, not much time to watch the 100´s of people standing in line.It is expensive for a family, but just something you have to do once in your life.","Great visit, do buy the quick pass"
"July 12, 2018","A very wonderful ride with some brilliant views of London. The entire ride takes around twenty minutes so it felt like good value for money. We had great weather so we were able to take some awesome pictures. The only negative is that they have many fully automated vending machines but it was never advertised, and as far as I could see, nobody even knew of their existence. Everyone queued up at the manned teller's which took about half an hour. Very big waste of time and resources.",London eye - book online but print in building
"July 11, 2018","A must do in London with kids. We booked our tour online because we had 11 people. When we got there it was very slow to try and open each ticket on my cell phone.   I eventually went in the building and printed out paper tickets with my confirmation code. so for anyone who has lots of tickets,  I would recommend just printing inside from the start since cellular reception is not the best.",Good
"July 11, 2018",Busy but manageable with the fast-line tickets. Takes 30mins. Great for pics. Provides a good idea of the layout of London and the key places of interest. ,Book in Advance!
"July 11, 2018","A check off the box sight.  Not sure it's worth the price as there isn't a lot to see from the top.  Definitely do the advance tix and we did pay extra for a certain time to reduce the wait.  Actually, we booked for the first time of the day so the line was only 5 minutes.  Many people don't realize, there is a 5 minute 4-D experience right across from the London Eye that is included with your ticket.  Of course, they want you to buy the family photos, but it is fun.  Try to go early before the lines get long.  From here, you can walk across the street to Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, etc.",Line moves quickly
"July 10, 2018",We were warned that if we didn’t prepurchase tickets we may not get in. In our case this wasn’t true and we were able to get right in. We bought tickets at 5:45 on a Monday evening for 6:15.  We walked right to the end of the line and by 6:15 we loaded the Eye. In our case the fast pass would have not been worth it. The views were great. Too bad there isn’t an audio tour or map or something to walk you through some of the sites. Overall very efficient. ,Champagne Experience is Worth it!
"July 10, 2018","I had an amazing time with the Champagne experience which was only like a 40 pound upgrade price.  You skip the line, wait upstairs in a VIP lounge and enjoy hand crafted cocktails (you purchase your own), your ticket is good for one glass of champagne while on the London eye and have a private host with you and a small group the entire time.  Once you are at the top, you have  a full panorama view of London and it is absolutely breathtaking.  Everyone was so nice and your host will even take pics of you if you are a solo traveler like myself :)The ride wasn't too short and not too long, it was just right.  Well worth the price!",Great on a sunny day
"July 10, 2018",enjoyed the ride. Queue moved very fast. dont rush for a seat in the capsule as you move around and the ride is not that long (20 min). would recommend!,Gate1
"July 9, 2018",The trip was amazing and the eye is a must see..the views are outrageous. The lines are long recommend speed pass.,Amazing View
"July 9, 2018","The view from the eye is amazing and worth the money and the wait. Absolutely breathtaking and the highlight of my trip.One could clearly see Buckingham Palace, St James park, Westminster Abbey, the Parliament, but it was disappointing that the Tower Bridge was not visible from i",It was overrated 
"July 8, 2018",London is super expensive and everyone wants to do the London eye! It was OK nothing special you are packed in with 20 other individuals and the Big Ben is fully covered in construction work! It was ok but I would never do it again,Nice
"July 8, 2018",Nice view I recommend to buy the BiG LONDON TICKET GOOD DEAL FOR 5 attractions you can check it online ,Ok....
"July 8, 2018","My kids were expecting to go to the London eye so much, once we got there I realized it was all about the marketing, the views are amazing and really worth the time but I think it is a little overrated, it is a little slow, it takes about 30 min from start to finish plus the long line before, I suggest to buy the skip the line tickets to save some time. ",Champagne Experience on the London Eye
"July 7, 2018",Had a great time.  The Champagne Experience with the Eye Lounge was perfect. It was a crazy busy day at the Eye and being able to relax in the Lounge was great.  When it was time for our ride the guides came to get us and escorted us to the front of the line where we boarded the Eye capsule along with a container of champagne.  Definitely worth the extra money not to stand in long lines. And the guides (Rhona and Matthew) were personable and informative.  ,Birds eye view of London
"July 7, 2018",This is definitely worth doing. You get some great views of the city. We pre-booked and so when it was our time we were able to walk straight in with very little waiting. The pods are air conditioned and that was important as it was quite hot the day we did it. The pod was clean and is quite spacious - they didn’t crowd too many people in which meant we all could move about quite easily and take photos from all directions.,Don’t waste money on queue priority
"July 6, 2018",I wondered about paying the extra to get priority boarding but based on other reviews and the significantly higher cost I did not do this. It turned out we only waited about 15 minutes to board as it was not too busy. But I did not see a priority line anywhere.It is worth the money as you get great views of London and it takes about 30 minutes for a complete circle.,Excellent though busy.
"July 6, 2018","This was part of an ""experience"" day given to me last Christmas. London waa rather hot and very busy in general and so was the London Eye. I was using my mobility scooter and ALL the staff went out of their way to be helpful and very friendly. Wouldnt hesitate to recommend this visit, the veiws from the wheel were fabulous and the staffs attitude made me feel very special.",Good views
"July 5, 2018",Long line when we went.  Great views but not worth the price or wait in my opinion.  The lines were confusing and the crowds were crazy big on the day we went.  ,"See by river, not by eye!"
"September 10, 2021","Booked a dual package of the London Eye and River Cruise through a train 241 deal. In all honesty, it was my first time on the London eye and it was underwhelming- could greatly do with some guides around to navigate you on what you can see. In stark opposition however, was Mick, the hero of the hour, in the accompanying river cruise. Mick is a true cockney man: chirpy, cheeky and just begging to be chastised for his groan-inducing jokes. It was a great 40 minutes around the Thames, and now I have great tibits and facts to bring to dinner parties.There's room for everyone on the top deck to get full views, but I'd recommend getting there some 15 minutes before if you want choice of seats. This is the way to see London; just take a coat with you! Far better experience than the eye, and at a ~ third of the price, think we paid £8 each!",Hit and miss
"September 10, 2021","Suspect how you rate this attraction will depend on 2 factors the weather and the number of people in your pod. On the day we visited, although it was a dry day with just a few clouds, up at the top the view was hazy so you couldn’t see that far and what you could see didn’t make great photos. More critical is the number in your pod. The system is unfair and if you are concerned about Covid, verging on unsafe. Bearing in mind it was quiet when we got there, we were surprised when a member of staff shouted this is your pod because there was already 10 people in the pod made up of 2 families and 2 large adults not of the same family . Most pods seem to have had 4-6 people with some 2. What they meant was we struggled to take ours photos. Whilst the 2 families were happy to accommodate us, the 2 large adults hogged the best positions and were almost developing a romantic bond by the time they got off. I appreciate the pods can accommodate 25 people but at £31 a ticket, expected less people in our pod and certainly when you’re supposed to keep some distance. Previously been positive about this attraction but very much doubt will be going on it again.",Viewing rooftops
"September 9, 2021","Never fails to impress and the grandchildren loved the experience, not so keen on the hustle to recover photo's too many people or poorly executed couldn't make up my mind. The ride and staff were excellent.",Great 
"September 9, 2021",Was a lot better than I thought it would be. My partner wanted to go on it (which surprised me as he does not like heights) very safe and some excellent views from the top. It is a very smooth ride. Excellent security and every hub is cleaned before next person gets in ,Spectacular views
"September 8, 2021","Rain or shine the London Eye never disappoints. Fun for family, friends and couples alike. Competitive prices. Souvenir shop on premises.",Awesome London Eye Pub Car
"September 8, 2021",Had a great trip on the London Eye Pub car with guide and bartender Arnie. What an amazing experience and enthusiastic operation,OK but not top of our list!
"September 7, 2021","Positives: It was easy to book, no queues, really pleasant staff, great views.Negatives: people sharing our pod were not wearing masks. Unless you stand, your view is spoiled by bright pink advertising stickers for last minute.com.All in all, nice to do but we enjoyed the sights more from the river cruise.",Thames Cruise
"September 7, 2021","Drew the guide was very confident, witty and knowledgeable and explained everything in an easy to understand way. The cruise was just about the correct length of time too.",Worth a visit
"September 6, 2021",Visited 4th September.  Bought a joint ticket for this and madame tussauds which made the price a little kinder. This is something to go on once. It is pleasant but not something I would do twice. It is in a good place though for walks after along the river Thames or a boat ride,Must see attraction 
"September 6, 2021","The whole family loved the London eye. Spectacular views of London. Was a little expensive to pay on the door, but if you book in advance or hunt around the internet for deals you can make substantial savings. We pod £55 for a family of four.",Avenue Vert 
"June 24, 2018","The Eye is the start point of the Avenue Vert Cycle route to Paris. We took a trip and from the top on a clear day the view across London is spectacular. We could see the Trooping of the Colour as it headed down the Mall from Horse Guards, St Paul's, All of the now iconic tower blocks of Central London and Canary wharf. It's a great vantage point to orientate yourself to the layout of the capital and the distances of the popular sites.",Great activity
"June 23, 2018",The line up wasn’t bad so we didn’t buy a fast track ticket and only waited about 30 minutes to board. The ride is very comfortable in an air conditioned “capsule”. The views were great and we got some fantastic pictures. It’s well worth the price of admission. ,Fun! Fun!
"June 23, 2018","We had done the London Eye on a previous visit, but our daughter and granddaughter really wanted to do it, so we did it again. It’s very enjoyable particularly if you can point out specific areas e or buildings. Wish there was an identification key/map in the capsule. ",Okay
"June 23, 2018",Another attraction near westminster abbey and big ben! This London Eye may give your London to-do-list A great shoot! ,Great view - busy!
"June 22, 2018","Great view, but beware that London pass doesn’t have a fast track for this. Some crazy amount of marketing as you would expect, with multiple opportunities for you to buy a drink or snacks before you get on.Seems like you should get a free can of soda for the price of admission though ;).If I ever go another time, would definitely try way early or late; lots of other tourist attractions in the area keep a large crowd.",Going on the Eye was so fun and a great view of London!
"June 19, 2018","Highly recommended, I would do it again!  Buy the Fast Track tickets and avoid a long wait in line. It was busy on a Saturday.",Awesome views with high price tag
"June 19, 2018",The wheel moves very slowly so it gives opportunity to have great views of the infrastructures around the river Thames. Be prepared to wait in the long queue and the price is quite expensive. ,Great view of London
"June 18, 2018",The wait was only about 15 minutes. The views were spectacular. The cabin was spacious and comfortable. Only had one day there. Glad we chose the London Eye over a bus tour.,#EyeLoveLondon
"June 18, 2018",Amazing site to see. A must go to tourist attraction. Enjoyed the 4d theater and the view from the ride. Great for picture taking. Captured nice photos. Although the Big Ben is under construction still had a good view of it and buckinghams palace,A must when in London for pleasure.
"June 18, 2018","A definite must to view parliament, the big Ben, the river thames and other city views from very high up. It moves really slow. Ride is about 25 minutes. Great for photos. The pods are air conditioned and have a place to sit in the middle.",A Must
"June 16, 2018","Great views of the city. Very comfortable, hardly noticed the movement. Staff very friendly and efficient.",Great experience totally recommend it 
"June 16, 2018",This a must if you travel to London really nice experience and you can buy a couple of attractions in same ticket ,Great Views
"June 16, 2018","Standard tourist attraction. While providing great views there are a lot of high rise buildings that you can visit also sometimes at a lower cost. The staff are pleasant and helpful but you will need to book and plan your visit as there is always a queue, ",Full marks for special needs assistance
"June 14, 2018","I visited with my severely autistic and non-verbal 19 year old son. He is unpredictable in crowds and very suspicious of new situations. I warned the ticket office at the time of purchase and they were very attentive to accommodate his needs. As half anticipated, when we reached the pod, he had a panic attack and tried to run away, eventually being persuaded to sit down on the ramps where everyone was queuing. The staff were great, clearing some space around him, and eventually stopping the Eye from rotating so he could enter in calm and controlled conditions, ensuring he was happy before restarting the wheel. He loved it and was absolutely buzzing when the ride was over. It is fantastic when attractions go out of their way to ensure people like my son get the opportunity to enjoy experiences the rest of us take for granted and which they would otherwise be denied.",Beautiful View along the Thames
"June 12, 2018",The London Eye was a great experience. Some of the best views of London come from within these rotating tubes. ,VIP Champagne package
"June 11, 2018","Definitely worth the price! We did not have to make the huge line, but were immediately shown to the VIP Lounge and had a glass of Champagne while we waited for our Tour Guide. We did not wait 10 minutes before Nathan showed up. What a pleasure this young man was! He had lots of trivia to share which made the ride much more interesting. The view was spectacular, and we had another glass of Champagne at the very top. We had a great time, beautiful view of London, definitely worth the price.",EIFFEL TOWER VIEW OF LONDON CITY..
"June 6, 2018",it is a good place to have an overview of the major attractions of London city in a giant wheel...especialy if you dont have a lot of time to explore the city. you need to be lucky to have a sunny day to enjoy it better,Fabulous View
"June 3, 2018",We went on a Saturday and it was school holidays here so very busy. We had vouchers so had to line up for them then lined up to get on the London Eye. But let me tell you it was well worth it. Fantastic view!!! Very well organized 👌🏻,"Nice views and all, but..."
"June 3, 2018",...since I paid for overpriced fast track tickets for me and my daughter I can't really give the Eye a higher grade. £77 for a thirty minute spin is too much.,Brilliant
"June 1, 2018","The weather was beautiful, the sights beyond the city were fab. It goes very smoothly in the pod you can't tell you are moving.",Best way to see London
"May 31, 2018","Probably the most touristy thing we did but very well done and clean. Even on a hot day in London 75F/25C, it was cool in the capsules.",Got to do the London eye when in London 
"May 30, 2018","Well, it’s just a customary thing to do when in London.Good with these setbacks: Queues were long without the priority tickets, book time slots in advance but wasn’t really sure if it made any difference as the queue was just as long. Get the combo pass and check out the priority pass to see if it does make any difference. ",Great view on sunny day
"May 30, 2018",The London eye gives you a great view of the city especially on a sunny day. The area is very congested and touristy. You do the eye once and that's it. Its like Niagara Falls - you go when family is in from put of town. Lines move very quickly. ,It was not nearly as good as many reviews make it seem
"May 28, 2018",Was just a really slow moving car full of kids... at least we had skip the line tickets and didn't have to wait in a long line for a pretty boring ride. ,Great vuew
"May 28, 2018","Great trip on the London Eye, you can see all of London from the top. The staff were really friendly and very caring towards the less able passengers.",Exquisite
"May 25, 2018","Thoroughly enjoyed every minute.  Love that it doesn't stop and is always moving.  So much fun, and the views are incredible!  Well worth it!",Just ok
"May 25, 2018","I was honestly expecting more/better views from this attraction. We purchased the fast track tickets which saved us from waiting in the long standard ticket line. We waited maybe 10 minutes before getting onto the eye. Overall, I was expecting more and left feeling a little disappointed ",a GREAT way to see London!
"May 23, 2018","We visited the Eye on our first evening in London.  We made reservations months in advance (highly recommended) for the 6 pm ""champagne VIP event"" where we spend the leisurely half hour that it takes to make the full circuit as we sipped champagne  with about 12 other people as our guide pointed out the sights and helped us take pictures of ourselves in just the right places.  It certainly got our visit to London off on the right footing!",London eye
"May 23, 2018",This was our second visit to the eye and was even better than the first. The staff were excellent and as my wife is disabled and uses a small electric scooter she needs a ramp to enter the ride and the two guys were speedy cheerful and very helpful. The book that comes with your pictures of the ride has improved massively.,Fear of heights
"May 20, 2018",This was a first for meMy fear of heights was not a problem as long as I didn't look down lolI felt safe and very little movement until we were going over the top The views are great on a clear dayGreat feature a d can't believe I waited do long ,Champagne Experience 
"February 27, 2018","My friends and I did the champagne experience to spice up the trip a bit. It wasn’t over the top as expected. Our tour guide was friendly, Asian guy. But didn’t talk at all during the tour. I was expecting him to talk about the buildings and be knowledgeable ... wasn’t sure if he was tired or what. Also- we asked for some OJ that was on his cart with our champagne and he gave us a hard time about it. Overall anyone should do the London Eye because it is beautiful and you see the whole city. I would recommend doing it at sunset . It was breathe taking views. ",Amazing view!!!
"February 26, 2018","I went to London eye with a combo with London Dugeon, Sea Life Aquarium and Madame Touseeau, which is cheaper than by one by one and it was amazing, ",Fantastic Views
"February 23, 2018",A comfortable and educational way to get an overview of London.  Don't forget your camera! Friendly and helpful guides.,Awful customer service. Illogical system.
"February 23, 2018","We purchased tickets online. As backpackers staying in a hostel we did not have access to a printer so could not print the tickets. However, we downloaded the PDFs to our phones. Most other tourist attractions in Europe now accept PDF tickets displayed on smartphones but evidently the London Eye is behind the times! The employees at the ticket office cut us off mid-sentence and sent us on our way down the road to a Coca-Cola branded convenience store (coincidence?) to pay a further £3 per page to print out our tickets. Then we lined up again so that we could exchange our paper tickets for new tickets that the employee printed on site. Impractical process and rude staff - a real shame for such an iconic tourist attraction. ",Get the fast track tkts worth it. 
"February 22, 2018",We bought our tickets with the big bus tours packages . It is ad a fast track which was really ideal in this cold weather . We waited just few mins for security checkup. The view from up high is breathtaking. ,Fantastic
"February 22, 2018",Absolutely loved going on the coca cola london eye the experience was amazing. I shall be going again,Cheers!
"February 20, 2018",Did the fast track tickets with champagne upgrade. So worth the extra attention and care. Can’t imagine the lines during prime season!,You must to go 
"February 19, 2018","Is a bit expensive but is the best attraction in London. I recommend. The view is amazing. Pick the clean day, would be better ",Champagne experience recommended 
"February 18, 2018","We booked the champagne experience and it was well worth the money , we sat in the sky bar until our time slot which was lovely , then got led through the large queue by our host for the champagne experience so there was very little queueing involved , beautiful at sunset .",London eye
"February 18, 2018","Great when you actually get on it, queues are a nightmare, tickets are very misleading - we pre booked a time slot, and the ticket info says to turn up and scan your ticket, go straight to gate. In reality, you turn up, and regardless what time it says on your ticket you are told to go to the back of the queue and expect up to an hour or more waiting.... beware..",great attraction & to see a lot of London form up high.
"February 11, 2018","Usually long queues to buy a ticket, but well worth the wait. Very efficiently run & the crowds move quickly. ",Amazing experience - birdseye view of London
"February 10, 2018","If you've got little time in London, do the London eye - it's a great view over London, with a flight-like experience, which is quite thrilling really.I had been many years ago but London's skyline has changed so much - I loved it, again.Downside: in peak season the queues are annoying - try to book early in the day and make sure you arrive with plenty of time to pick up tickets (if collecting). We queued for an hour.",Slow but Cool
"February 9, 2018","It takes about 35 minutes to get around on a good night- sites are beautiful though, I personally don't like heights, but you do get used to it as you go around.I recommend doing it in the night time because the lights are stunning - worth doing and nice to take a break after a busy day :)",Unique view
"February 9, 2018",All London in your feet... you make really good selfies there..  but it's only for 20-30 minutes approximately.. ,Great views! 
"February 6, 2018","This is a must for Londoners. Go in the evening when it is not so busy! It’s fun to spot the different land marks from up high, and the information boards are great too. ",Good sky view and landmark 
"February 4, 2018","It’s worth to try one time. At least, you can see the view of London city and those landmark buildings. ",A London Eyecon
"February 3, 2018","A must, when in London, be sure to get the Fast Pass.  Staff are courteous, the area is clean,  and there is a gift shop. Fun for the whole family! Don’t go though if you are afraid of heights!  ",Beautiful London Views of Major Landmarks
"February 3, 2018","Our family of four walked from the Westminster Abbey across the bridge to the London Eye. I highly recommend walking around and seeing the views. Once we arrived at the London Eye, we purchased our tickets about an hour before sunset and made our place line. Sunset is usually a popular time so please get their early. There are a few places to eat around the mall area. It is definitely a ""must-do"" while in the city.",Great view 
"January 30, 2018",Great view u can see many of the sights such as Buckingham palace and Wembley stadium and many other sights I would definitely recommend if like to see the sights . ,"Terrific view of the Thames, Big Ben, The Tower of London, and so on."
"January 28, 2018","If travelling from Canada, get your tickets from Trip Advisor and take them the day of your visit.  Easy, no line up to buy tickets, well worth it.  The wheel moves so slowly, even the most squeamish can take a ride on the London Eye. At first my 79 year old mom was worried, but then she was quickly at the window looking out!",Overrated
"March 7, 2018","I would say that the London Eye is a must, but no more than once. The view is definitely great, but overall it's overpriced, overcrowded and overrated. I would strongly advise ordering your tickets beforehand, unless you want to spend an hour waiting outside.",to the top of london
"March 5, 2018",The best way to see London from above. The pods are very spacious although if you don't like being closed in this may not be good for you. It moves slowly so you have a lot of time to see the amazing views over London. Make sure that you pick a clear day. Be ready to wait for your turn as this could be up to 15minutes or longer. Not suitable for people who are not good on their feet.,"""Big wheel keeps on turning"""
"March 5, 2018","Admittedly we did do this in style, amidst the hundreds queuing we went straight up to the VIP lounge, having booked it some time ago. A nice glass up bubbly in the splender of the lounge, then collected and escorted to the pod complete with its own mini bar and another couple of glasses to boot. Views of London f of a unique position on a cold but fine sunny day and only a five minute walk from Gilray's Steak Bar and all that County Hall has to offer, great night out and spectacular when the wheel is lit up after dark","Nothing special, disorganization, rude staff"
"March 4, 2018",I supposed it was a special attraction but it wasn't. We also did almost 2 hours queue to buy tickets. Staff very rude and completely disorganized as they should be cause the place attracts a lot of people every single day.,pretty every time
"March 4, 2018",I've been to the London Eye 3 times and I enjoyed it equally each time. It never gets boring! The only downside is the long queuing but I guess that's part of the experience too  ,Amazing
"March 3, 2018","This trip was amazing and benefited from London on a cold crisp morning. The views were fantastic, the organisation to get you on and off was fine and plenty of space in your capsule as you completed the journey.Great views of Westminster/Whitehall and as far as Buckingham Palace. The whole trip was one of great enjoyment.",360 degree view of London
"March 1, 2018",London eye gives the option to get 360 degree view of city. It’s looks beautiful from the top and you can have a bird eye view of all important places of London. There is an entry fee for this attraction and you have the option to book the same in advance through online. We visited London eye during snow and view was breathtaking. ,Champagne Experience

"February 23, 2018",A comfortable and educational way to get an overview of London.  Don't forget your camera! Friendly and helpful guides.,Nice view from the top; somewhat pricey
"January 6, 2018",I should have researched what all I wanted to see from the skyline before laying down the price for the tickets.,Nice day out 
"January 6, 2018",London Eye - never really thought it would hold interest me but took my parents and young children and they loved the experience 45 min can be long ....... but enjoyed the experience Would again recommend ,Recent trip to London
"January 5, 2018",First time visiting London and wanted to go on the Coca Cola London Eye. Booked out tickets in advance prior to travelling. The queue was huge but that said it soon went down and we didnt wait too long to board. The views are amazing even on a cloudy day. This is a MUST do when in London. The 'Pod's were not too full so plenty of room to move about and get a full 360 look over the London Skyline. They even have information points inside. Lasted about 30 mins and well worth the money,Good view from the top
"January 5, 2018",Very excited to go to London Eye. Unfortunately very long queue (over an hour to get on) and was a little dissapointing. You get an excellent view but you would have to know what you were looking at in the first place. Unless you knew London really well or there was a commentary you could listen to about the area then is is just a mass or unidentifiable buildings. I had hoped I would come down with a general understanding of where everything was but was none the wiser. ,Great view
"January 5, 2018",Even being afraid of heights I was able to enjoy this. The view from top was absolutely brilliant and worth every minute,London
"January 4, 2018",This is de most and the best attraction to view London!!I recommend   Know this place at sunshine!  It’s the best experience in London... ,I wish I could give this more than 5 Stars
"January 4, 2018","I absolutely loved this attraction.  We got the ""Champagne Experience""  It was worth the extra money and top notch from start to finish, beginning with a separate area while we waited where we could purchase a beverage before boarding.  We didn't, but I will if we go again!   Our Tour Guide Chris, was informative, professional and fun. As you can imagine, the views are spectacular.",very nice but a little over rated
"January 3, 2018","very nice, well managed and pleasant experience. London view from the top of the eye is worth an experience.",Pleasant trip but seriously overpriced 
"January 3, 2018","We were fortunate in that the weather was kind, so good views over London were possible. The experience was quite well run and queues were manageable. I still think it’s massively overpriced for 25 minutes. ",Good view
"January 1, 2018","A truly memorable experience. This is a great way to get a ""birds eye"" view of London. I definitely recommend getting the flexi-fast track ticket. It will save you a lot of time and pairing it with another attraction can save you money as well. Don't leave London without taking a ride on the Eye. ",A must do on your first trip to London
"December 31, 2017","The best way to get the lay of the land.  You can skip the 4D movie, it doesn't add much to the experience.",Okay-ish experience
"December 29, 2017",The ride was too slow and long for the kids. The view was indeed spectacular with the river flowing below and you could see almost all of london. However with kids (5&7) they got bored within 15 minutes of the ride. The box was warm and about 20 ppl were accommodated for one round in one box.,Best views ever!!
"December 29, 2017",I went there with my ten-year-old son. He loved it and said it was one of the highlights of our trip. The views were very beautiful and great for selfies and panoramas. The staff were helpful and kind. We felt very safe. We got fast passes so we got to skip the queue. Great time!,Ahhh.... Champagne!!!
"December 28, 2017","Unless you're doing the VIP champagne experience this is just another tourist trap.  You wait a long time in a queue to go around twice on this architecturally impressive Monument, and then you're ushered to the area where they trying to sell you the old photo on the mug nonsense.However, the Night-Time champagne experience was worth it because you skip the queue, and once near the top you get a glass of Champagne and are there with a much smaller group, if any, and you get to enjoy a beautiful sunset view of London.",Gorgeous 
"December 27, 2017",I went with a 4 year old and 7 year old. Excellent experience for everyone. Hands down do not miss this. ,"Pay for Fast Pass...it's worth the visit, but not the lines"
"December 27, 2017",The views of London are spectacular - but it's not tix you want to buy ahead as the visibility can be poor. We bought fast pass which cut our wait time down to less than 10 minutes on a busy holiday.  ,Worth the visit
"December 18, 2017",Amazing experience. The views were fantastic. Well organized entry. Only queued for 10mins. Easy to reach from Waterloo Underground. The 4D experience was amazing,Lovely 
"December 16, 2017",I am a Londoner so typically I never do the 'touristy' things as you always take them for granted being that they are always on your doorstep. However for my birthday my boyfriend surprised me with a champagne VIP package and it was lovely. The sun was setting so the view looked lovely and the champagne was lovely. Nothing else much to say but if you are visiting it's worth doing  to take some nice pictures and have the experience  ,Are you kidding me?
"December 13, 2017","Going to London during the winter is a risky thing due to the weather.  First couple of days the weather was cold and overcast but no rain so it was great.  Big bonus to going at this time of year is that the lines are much, much shorter.  The last two days the weather was bad.  Rain mixed with sleet and snow.  We went to the Eye on a Sunday and it was closed due to bad weather.  You would figure that being in London they would know how to deal with this.  We went back the next day, same kind of weather, and it was open.  Why closed one day but open the next?  We stood in line for an hour and a half, and this was a slow day!  Most of the time that we were in line we were not under cover, but outside dealing with the bad weather.  We had coats, scarves, gloves and umbrellas but still got very wet and very, very cold.  The cost of a ticket per adult is about $23.  They fit at least 12 adults into each car and there are I believe about 20 cars on the Eye.  That works out to be just over $5500 per full revolution.  I don't know how many times this thing does a full revolution, but I think 10 would be a safe number.  $55,000 a day, conservatively is what they make.  So, ARE YOU KIDDING ME!, that they cannot afford to put up a proper canopy with some heat lamps during the winter months.  There were people in wheel chairs, parents with kids in strollers, all having to stand out in that bad weather for hours.  I don't care how prepared you are, when it's that cold and wet, and you are outside for that long, you are miserable.All the money these guys are making, they should be making more of an effort to make their guests comfortable.  The ride and the view from the Eye are spectacular, that's the only reason why I gave this three stars instead of one.",Great experience
"December 4, 2017",It was great experience and didn’t have to queue for very long! Nice to go once and see all of London ,London’s Main Attraction.. Oddly
"January 26, 2018","Me and my mother were recommended to book tickets before actually arriving in London as it can get quite full on the day so to avoid disappointment! you However, we booked this specific day as it was the only day available out of the days we were visiting which obviosuly suggested it was going to be busy but it was also the only day out of our visit that the heavens opened and absolutely chucked it down ALL DAY!We got soaked queuing because the queue was so long that half of it wasn’t under the shelter and that kind of ruined it as we were cold and wet in the capsule. We couldn’t see that far into the distance because it was all dark and cloudy!Although the weather is uncontrollable, it would be good to have open tickets and a bigger sheltered area! We would’ve chosen not to go but it was £48 for 2 of us which is a lot just to throw away! This price is ridiculous for what it is! Not at all worth it so I wouldn’t waste your money unless you get one of the packages with multiple attraction tickets but we’d already done the dungeons and madame tussaud’s on a previous trip! ",London Eye
"January 25, 2018",This is so amazing I suggest every one see this at last once and spend the day here grab lunch sit outside in the spring and summer,Pram madness
"January 23, 2018","I came with my family and not until we were about to get on we were told to remove our two young children from their Prams and carry the prams and children on to the capsule, this is ridiculous and ruined our experience. Why were we not told before and what is the difference in having out Pram up or or it taking up half the floor space folded down inside the capsule. This is not being managed properly and it requires sorting. Behind us was a lady with twins in a double buggy and she was told she was have to wait u til a wheelchair user came off before she could go on. Outstanding! ",Spectacular views of London
"January 22, 2018","Views from London Eye are very nice.  I find it more worth than the View at the Shard.  Long wait though even in winter, so be prepared to wait in queue for some time.",S.m garrett
"January 22, 2018",Lots of quing but worth it in the end go later in the day when it's quieter cos tourists go seem to have gone a bit by then ,Terrifying
"January 19, 2018","No toilets in the pods, nearly cacked myself, tourists laughing and screaming, terrible Brexit now or we're  dead",Excellent view 
"January 14, 2018","My recommendation is to make a fast track ticket, you can avoid long queue on the ticket office. Is a little bit expensive than the ordinary ticket but is better if you don’t have a lot of  time to stay in London. You must see this attraction. Really recommended!  ",Nope
"January 11, 2018",Very expensive and the queue is massive! It’s only for one time ! Never again ! Oh my lord never again.,Champagne experience 
"January 8, 2018",Outstanding experience and recommend this place too anyone.. My partner and I decided too do something different for her birthday and we weren't disappointed.. Our Pod host Gianni was excellent and made the whole event very special.,Goof views
"January 7, 2018",Got tickets on the day. The que for the bag check could have done with someone explaining what was going to happen to speed up the process. There was a small amount of que jumping. However the eye gives scenic views. The best time to go is late afternoon. The crowds have died down and you can get both light day pictures and early sunset photos. The price has increased dramatically since my last visit. I would be wary to return unless visiting with someone new to London.,Worth a visit with the kids
"December 1, 2017","I presume it must be London’s answer to the Eifel Tower, although I don’t think it is as high as the Parisian icon. I would recommend this visit for parents with kids over 5, but watch out for the hefty price you would have to pay for the tickets. Beautiful views of London from a vantage point though!",Best 45 minutes spent in south bank
"November 28, 2017",Best 45 minutes spent in south bankwe took a tourfor viewing London from aboveenjoyed all of uswe had many pictures,A Tourist Trap
"November 26, 2017","It´s too boring, too crowded, and to expesive, for a 20/25min ride.Instead of spending your money here got to the Sky Garden, better views of London, and it´s FREE!!!",What a view!
"November 20, 2017","The London Eye was erected since my last visit to town, so I gave it a chance. It was a beautiful sunny clear day, and you could see for miles in every direction. You're in a car that holds 25 people or so, and the ride is one circuit which lasts about 25 minutes. Great angles for photos.",A good visit
"November 18, 2017",Had an enjoyable time taking photos along the way! Lots of photo opportunities with surrounding shops and attractions,Interesting but overpriced
"November 15, 2017",London Eye. Well it was alright but I would say overpriced and underwhelming. I would suggest some audio feed would make it more interesting but to each his own as I am  sure others would prefer the silence. I am not sure I would do again unless it was at daytime and I was with someone who really wanted to go on it. For a seasoned traveler to London I might think it would be underwhelming and would serve only to check off your bucket list. That said it depends on the age of rider(s) and might be cool for youngsters and those wishing to pick off seeing London landmarks from great heights.Side note- my picture once appeared in one of the booths/ capsules back in 2015 out of pure chance! So was cool to see that and to then actually go on the loop/tour years after the fact.,Just a Tourist  Stop
"November 7, 2017","Vacillated about doing this because it felt so touristy but finally broke down and went, It was ...okay. The view is spectacular but easily done at other places. It was efficiently organized and there was no wait involved at all.Do it cause you are supposed to but don't get too excited",Great day out 
"November 6, 2017",Best views in London depending on the weather! We got lucky and had a cloudless day fantastic! Combined with a trip to London aquarium afterwards.... south bank is a great place to take in the sights!,Cheated by London Eye website.
"November 3, 2017","My mother sister and I decided to book online to get the tickets for the London Eye, but were in for a nasty shock.When I went to pick up our 3 tickets, I was given 9 tickets, to my horror. I told the ticket booth girl I needed assistance, as I only bought 3 tickets, so she brought the manager over, who stated that I could try to get a refund if I sent an email to customer service.I did, and received several unhelpful emails before I finally got a reply today, November 3rd, 2 days later, only to be told they cannot help me.Meaning, I have lost 156 Great Britain Pounds of no fault of mine, even though the customer service person emailing me apologized for ""my error of buying 6 extra tickets."" I am a tourist visiting London with my mother and sister, making us a party of 3, so why would I buy 6 extra tickets?  And are you really going to blame me instead of helping me? Are you really going to keep my money, 156 sterling, without shame?   ",Spectacular views! 
"October 30, 2017",Would definitely recommend a trip on the London Eye. Take your camera and go on a clear day - you can see for miles. Gently climbs to its full height. The pods are roomy with seating available. ,Lovely views
"September 13, 2017",This is a great attraction that has great views of London. Best to book in advance as can be quite busy.,Exaggerated
"September 12, 2017","I must say, this was one of the things tourists do while they Visit London. To me, the London eye experience was not as much as I expected it to be. It felt like there were a lot of people in each bubble and that there's no etiquette about how to be, act, and do things from taking pictures to loudness. I don't think I would ever be on that thing or even advise anyone to be on it. I don't see what the big deal is about going up and down.",Not worth the price
"September 10, 2017",A bit expensive. Like most of the sightseeings and things to so..Just Thirty minutes of Big wheel to take a few pictures. This is not a must see must do it. ,A Big Ferris Wheel
"September 10, 2017","This is one of the attractions in London, essentially a big ferris wheel. It's at a pier and there are other activities that you can do there. We didn't actually ride since the line was long and it was hot the day we were there. There are a lot of photo places that you can take a picture to get that Instagram shot.",Spectacular view of London
"September 10, 2017",This was well worth it. We loved the 360 degree view of London.  We went late in the day  (5:30 pm) so there was no line.  This time of year it closes early (6pm) so make sure you sure allow enough time.,Ho hum visit
"September 9, 2017","Nice view, but a bit of a boring ride. I would not say anything to recommend this ride. My wife and I were both very disappointed.",Perfect way to start our London Trip
"September 8, 2017","My almost 7 year old son and I went to London this summer. We went on The London Eye on the afternoon of our arrival to get a feel for the city. I'm usually not a fan of heights, but the encloses pod made me feel totally secure. It wasn't too crowded, but still very busy. I thought it a little pricey for 30 minutes of entertainment (the reason for the 4 stars), but it was a great way to start our trip. We were able to point out some of the other places we were planning to visit. ",Amazing view
"September 7, 2017","That's about it. there's nothing special, only a great view and it is a very long ride (because it is slow). Big line to go to the attraction! ",Horrendous queues!!
"September 7, 2017",Biggest mistake visiting during school holidays absolutely horrendous waiting time and queues was not enjoyable at all squashed in a capsule/pod with pretty much as many people that they could put it not enjoyable at all. Will go off peak if I visit again at a quiet time ,A site to see literally!
"September 5, 2017","Since I had never visited London before everyone advised me that I have to do this.  The price is steep for a ferris wheel type ride, however the views you can see are remarkable.  I would suggest you pay the extra money to experience all the ""eye"" can see.",21st Birthday
"August 10, 2017","Love Love Love this attraction booked the champagne vip experience with fast track. Worth ever penny vip all the way. Special shout out to Arnie  our host who made our day with his excellent knowledge of the London view and his photography skills,",Just What You Would Expect A Huge Ferris Wheel to Be :)
"August 10, 2017",The park leading up to the Eye entrance is nice and and full of street performers. The cars on the Eye are big enough for your whole group to get on and ride together. The trip to the top is slow enough that you can enjoy the sites and take lots of pictures. London is an amazingly historical place and you will get some remarkable shots.,"Nice, but not worth the time and money invested"
"August 9, 2017","The view was great, I can't deny that. But overall, it is not worth the time spent waiting in the Q and certainly not worth the money.Been there, done that. Period. Not going there again.",Great View of London City 
"August 9, 2017","A lovely experience on the London Eye. I would recommend the fast pass as we queued for an hour but we were lucky it wasn't too warm so it was manageable. Great views of the City, staff were pleasant, would recommend this tourist attraction. ",Loved every second!
"August 6, 2017",I truly enjoyed this attraction! The staff is very professional and the attraction is totally worth it. It is a must see in London,High-light
"August 5, 2017",45 minute line to get in although they are reasonably organized. View from the top is excellent and was worth the money and time. ,Beautiful Views
"August 4, 2017",We did the London Eye at night which was definitely worth it. Seeing London lit up at night was breathtaking. A must do when you're in London.,Great experience
"August 4, 2017","A bit expensive, but really great experience offering amazing views of London. I recommend purchasing the tickets online. This way the waiting times are quite acceptable.",Typical Ride Around
"July 30, 2017","The ride was pleasant, the long line was not and my only reason for not giving five stars. Booked with discount by also doing Madam Tussauds (which we had planned on anyway).","Overrated, save your money"
"July 30, 2017","Not worth the view and the experience. You get bored after few mins as it goes really slow and there isn't anything outstanding to see. London is beautiful 'from the ground'. Honestly, save your money and got to Sky Garden instead for free if you really keen on London's views!",The Viator Champagne Tour
"July 25, 2017","We did the Viator Champagne tour of the London Eye. You got to skip the line, have a cocktail (out of pocket) in the Eye Lounger before boarding the capsule and having champagne with a view (included with ticket).",Great views of London that you won't see anywhere else!
"July 24, 2017",The London Eye was a great experience. They don't cramp too many people in to each carriage which is awesome because you can move around freely and see the views from each side. Beware: the only toilets nearby you have to pay for so go in a restaurant if you have lunch or before you leave! We also couldn't find anywhere to fill up our drink bottles and were there on a 30 degree day! Overall an awesome experience!,One of the best views of London
"July 22, 2017","Revolves slowly so that you can take as much photographs or video shoots as you can. Takes around half hour, this is the most visited site in London. Pre book your ride since it is usually sold out especially on weekends.",a view
"July 19, 2017","I was reluctant to visit the Eye, but I found a 2-for-1 deal with National Rail Service - one person purchases a ticket and another person gets in free if they have Rail Service travel cards for that day.Best advice, book in advance and research the 2-for-1 deal on the UK National Rail Service so that you miss the long lines and get a better price. A nighttime visit is better.",Amazing
"July 19, 2017",A great attraction. Worth paying for the fast track to avoid the huge queue. My confirmation email did not have any content but when I went to collect my tickets there were no problems and I was dealt with very quickly. ,Fun on the Eye
"July 17, 2017","What a terrific vantage point to look down on so many of the tourist sites - parliament, the river Thames, Big Ben and more.  Well worth the visit.  Take the fast track option",Great view of the city
"July 16, 2017","It's pricey and tons of people go there, but seeing the city from that high up is pretty awesome. Recommended for first-time visitors to the city. ",Guess You Have to Do Once
"July 15, 2017","If you are visiting London for the first time I guess this is one of those things you must do.  We purchased the fast pass online the day before.  Ticket downloaded to phone, worked great.  Expensive, but when traveling time is money.  I would not book this more than a day in advance as weather will be key to your enjoyment.  If you want to que, go early, but that applies to all the sites.  Best to check the weather and pick the best day for this.",Nice view
"July 14, 2017","It is a nice view in London, but not a thing that you could not to do. If you have a short time, the length of the line is a problem, but was nice. Near the London eye was happening a African fair with some delicious things to eat.",Great views of a great city.
"July 14, 2017","Organised and pretty easy to get aboard, we paid for the fast track service but we still had to queue for a little while.

"July 7, 2017","Fun time, we purchased the Fast track from our tour company which had to be exchanged at the Ticket office in old county hall.  The tour takes 30 mins and gives you great views of the city.  We did our ride/tour in the late afternoon.   ",Don't miss this 
"July 6, 2017","The line looked long but we were on after  buying tickets in about 40 minutes.  We had a member of our party who has some fear of heights and can be motion sick.  He had neither problem on the Eye. Watch yourself taking pictures. If you are too close to the glass, you are reflected into the photo.  They do have spots on the floor to help you with better photos. The 4# view helper was not a good buy.  For me, I could either try and line that up or actually experience the ride. They don't jam you in cattle style so you have plenty of chances to move around. This was my second time on the Eye and would do it again.",Overpriced and Underwhelming
"July 1, 2017","My sons saw this and couldn't wait to go.  It was over a $100 for the four of us. We didn't purchase the fastpass because we didn't need to. The line was just about 20 minutes long. They placed a lot of people in one cabin. There are benches in the middle but you are mostly standing and meandering around others during the rotation.  It would have been nice if there was a recording in the cabin that highlighted the sights as you went around.  I think this may have been an extra you could purchase.  There was a dollar foldable map we purchased that identified different buildings. Super disappointing and not worth the value.  I'd skip it and get free reservations at the Sky Garden - They have amazing views of the river and skylines, too. ",Good to check off the list 
"June 30, 2017","We felt the London Eye was a must-do & I still think that it is. We believe doing this attraction was good to do after we'd learned a bit of the city & knew the lay of the land - that way we could point to & pick out the what we knew as we rode. The ride itself lasts about 30 minutes. We purchased the fast pass for a Monday tour @ 1230pm. We'd been told doing this attraction during the day vs. as night would provide us with a better experience. I don't think we needed the fast pass, the line without it wasn't too long on that day @ that time, but the fast pass was nice to have - we didn't wait more than 5 minutes. The ride is not terribly exciting, but would probably be really fun for little ones. Overall, good experience. ",Can see sights across London
"June 30, 2017","The London Eye is really nice for the whole journey, you can see beautiful sights across London from all sides and get great quality photos. I can't comment on queue times as I have a pass however with fastrack you can get on almost immediately so it may be worth buying if the queues are long.",Brilliant cruise
"June 26, 2021",Was on this river cruise last week. Was brilliant and very informative.  Jack was an excellent guide. Very educated and extremely entertaining. Highly recommend👌,Good views of the city
"June 26, 2021","This was the one that I thought was guaranteed to be amazing but it was probably our least favourite out of the things we did, staff were nice and covid restrictions good, however, it was so quiet it might have been nice to have a pod to ourselves instead of with a couple of others, this could have been easily done as the other pods were empty, views were good and worth going up for, but think I have been spoilt having visited the shard and floor 17 of the news building, but it was still worth while and good value as part of a multi pass, not sure it would have been good value on its own but worth it with the other attractions. It was nice seeing the tops of hotels we have stayed at and attractions we have been to in the past.",River boat tour
"June 26, 2021","I’ve visited this city many times in life and this was the first time we’ve taken the river tour, we were treated and instructed what to do due to covid restrictions, there was adequate space for all the people on board, the tour started on time and we went up and down the river from the eye to Tower Bridge and back, beautiful weather helped but what made the entire tour was the host, Vicky was so knowledgeable and so captivating, she kept everyone engaged during the trip and brought many smiles with her stories and way she educated all of us on our great city, we will definitely come again.",Great views
"June 24, 2021",People always ask what they should do when visiting London. I always say that The Eye is an amazing experience. It’s got the best views of london from Downing Street to Wembley Stadium. It’s a lot of fun and really easy and hassle free getting in if you buy in advance. When it reopens try and go.,SUPERB FROM START TO FINISH

"June 24, 2021",Amazing champagne experience with our guide AJ. He was very fun and knowledgeable. Great views over the Thames River and London skyline. Due to COVID there were only four of us so we had the whole pod almost to ourselves. The ride takes about 25 minutes.,Great experience

"June 22, 2021","Nice air conditioned pods, taking you slowly around so you can take in the views. It takes 30 minutes to do a full circle of the Eye, and its surprising how far can be seen from the top on a clear day. A 360° view in the pod makes seeing in all directions a pleasure.",Highlight for my 9 year old!
"June 11, 2017",Big tourist attraction but worth it!  Terrific view of London and it continues to me my daughter's favorite event of our two week vacation to England and Italy.  She also spotted a super cool playground from the air so we hit that right after.  Tip - don't stand in the ridiculous ticket line. Buy the ticket online using your phone! ,Skyline heaven
"June 11, 2017",The 30 minute ride was just what you would expect which was perfect for me.   It is smooth and you actually forget you are moving.   Plenty of space at the windows for picture taking and ogling the sites.   Hint:  buy the skip the line tickets ahead of time.   Our line was a 15 minute wait while the other line was 90 minutes.   Definitely worth the extra money. ,"A great view of the city, from the top of The Eye."
"June 11, 2017","Think of The Eye as a very slow moving Ferris wheel, but exceptionally much taller. Each compartment holds approximately 20 to 25 passengers at any given time.  The views are spectacular and there is an opportunity to get some great pictures of London. The only problem that we saw with this ride was that everybody else was trying to get great pictures at the same time. This is something you definitely want to do on your first trip to London or if you've been before and never had the opportunity to ride The Eye. Also, be sure to check the times that the ride is an operation, because it has different hours throughout the year.",Nice view
"June 9, 2017","This is great fun to get on and get a panoramic view of London.  You can see Big Ben, parliament, all the important places and get pictures. There is even a place to sit as you slowly rotate on the wheel. ",Great views of the city
"June 8, 2017","By buying our tickets a head of time, we were able to get on the Eye within 5 minutes.   A nice 30 minute ride, with great views of the city. ","Expensive, but really worth the views"
"June 3, 2017","To avoid long ticket lines, buy time specific tickets online before you leave home. This is a bit on the expensive side, but really the views (especially on a clear day) are spectacular. Try this on one of your first days in a multi-day visit to London to get a good view of the city.",Enjoyed trip. 
"June 2, 2017",Great attraction i have not been on eye since 2000. Very busy.  Its not very clear on where to go which queue to join on pre bought tickets so it would be helpful to have it clear on tickets on which queue you join.Shop very expensive.  Very easy to get there from Waterloo which to me is the nearest tube. ,A Must Visit

"May 28, 2017","The entire ticket purchase system is out of date and not from this century. If you have bought tickets beforehand, please remember to print out everything. The staff of this sight have not heard if digitalisation. Also, buying tickets beforehand does not mean you really have tickets. In our case the day was sold out many hours before the day was over and we were not allowed on the London eye. The only way to get it is to be there early morning",You can do it once I guess. 
"May 10, 2017","Like all attractions like this, it's expensive for what it is. It's somewhat fun the first time. It's much more enjoyable viewing at as a work of art and unique fixture of the city. ",Terrible Experience! Stay away...
"May 9, 2017","So I decided to take my son to the London Eye, so I bought tickets online. I really cannot do queues, so I chose Ultimate Fast Track tickets which came more expensive, but promised to ""skip the lines"". Only to discover, that in order to get the Ultimate Fast Track tickets I bought online, I would have to wait in the line for 45-60 minutes (my estimate, but pretty accurate based on what I saw and heard from other people) to pick them up. The same line as people who wanted to buy them. Total and complete fail by the London Eye! Do they know it is now the year 2017? Have they heard about electronic tickets? Do they know people check in online and receive boarding passed for transatlantic flights these days? Never ever again.",Fun
"May 7, 2017","Crowded, touristy, but a lot of fun.  Great views. 3 D movie included for free with eye tickets so don't let any 3rd party vendor/website upsell you on this. ",Completely underwhelmed
"May 6, 2017","What a waste of money.  I want a refund.We went on a beautiful sunny evening (5:15) so we had great views.However, it was very difficult to find where Togo because there were so many people.  Every staff member we spoke to have is a different answer (we pre-booked online).  It was very unorganized and I was really surprised that Coca Cola would attach their name to it.Once on board, it was so hot it was like a sauna - can't imagine it in August.  There is some technology on board so you can identify the buildings, but a lot of buildings I wanted to know about weren't labelled.  Also, the technology was slow and underwhelming.For some reason, a police officer was blocking the path on the Westminster bridge so we had to go all the way around the Marriott hotel which added about 6 blocks to our journey.  Give yourself an hour ahead of time to get there.Spend your money elsewhere - IMO this is a tourist trap.",A must do
"May 4, 2017","Somewhat quick attraction, big lines, a bit on the expensive side, but definitely worthwhile view.A new classic for London, definitely recommend to do at least once.",Well worth the visit
"May 4, 2017","Buy your ticket in advance online.  The queue was much shorter. They make you fold up your strollers before getting on, so keep that in mind...  ",Champagne and Chocolate tour! 
"May 3, 2017",Wow! What an experience on this engineering marvel!  We had 2 loops around and wonderful champagne and chocolate while we view on of the most amazing cities of history! A must do while in London! Bravo!,"Take your camera, pick a clear day!"
"May 2, 2017",This is really a fun way to spend an hour. Try to do on a clear day and be sure to bring your camera. The views are awesome. The capsules are comfortable.,London on high
"May 2, 2017","Fantastic views over London, a commentary would have improved the experience though.As queues at ticket office were so long and we had pre-booked on line, didn't see the 4d experience or visit the booking hall until after we had been on the Eye - it was well worth the visit,Tip - don't join the end of the queue until half an hour before your booked time as even if you are only a couple of minutes early at the check point, you will be sent back to the back of the queue.Also, you need to be quite sure footed to get into the pod as it doesn't actually stop for you to get on, could be a bit worrying for anyone less steady on their feet.Would definitely recommend this as a visit though,","Good views, but time cost is too high"
"April 29, 2017","The view from high is good. However, even we bought the advance ticket in slotted time of specific 15 minutes in specific date, we still need to queue up and wait for more than 40 minutes. The time cost is very high for visitors with limited time in London.Actually, I think it is better to take a photo of London Eye from the ground (opposite side of Thames River), this can save money and time.",Nice view!
"May 18, 2017","If the weather is clear, i do recomend a visit. You will have a nice view of London. The capsule you travel is super safe and even the one´s that don´t like heights will be confortable siting in the middle of the capsule (which is totaly closed).",What a tourist night mare
"May 17, 2017","We went there on a Saturday around noon - the place was overcrowded with tourists running around without any sort of guidance. Went in to buy normal ticket, but the line was so long, that after some time we gave that up and looked for the Fast Lane office.Even that lane was long - and it moved even slower that the normal one - seemed to have only a few to sell the quite more expensive tickets.......So no - not a place for us.",Queue isn't as bad as it seems
"May 17, 2017","Queues look unreal but it does go in fairly quickly, so I wouldn't let that dishearten you.  There's so much down there with the London aquarium, London dungeons and the Shrek adventures so you can easily spend hours here anyway. We bought the ticket that gave us access to the London eye, Madame Tussaud's and the Aquarium. What a fantastic buy.",A memorable experience

"May 14, 2017",We went on the London Eye on Saturday the 13th of May. It took us a minuet to find the right queue but there were many workers there to ask for help just so many different queues! We thought it was great to see that there were accessibility for disabled users.We were told to go to point B and to us the queue looked rather large but thinking about it now it was probably not what it is like when it was really busy. We ended up queuing for 40 minuets which we all thought was impressive for a Saturday so we expected worse - we were very glad it was not raining! It was rather annoying that there were two queue jumpers but I cannot blame the staff for that as there was no one near enough to see it and you cannot help rudeness.The staff once we got to the eye were great and helpful. They were very efficient and helpful. It also made us feel more secure to see how seriously they took the security. We went up on a clear day meaning we could see pretty far. There was an interactive screen where you could look at what you were actually seeing. The views were great and personally I loved getting to see London in a new way. I'm not sure how long we were on the Eye but it felt about right. It was worth the queue and the money we spent in our opinion.,Did not meet expectations 
"May 14, 2017","The whole experience of the event was underwhelming.I expected spectacular views but maybe it was the weather. Very touristy, seems they are more geared towards the tourists. ",Champagne Experience 
"May 13, 2017",Great way to see the city and kick off your trip in London. I highly recommend purchasing the champagne experience. You get two glasses of champs and skip the line! ,Nice but crowded
"May 13, 2017","Nice attraction, good view of London especially if you are lucky to be there in a sunny day. Prices are high but if you purchase the tickets along with another attraction you can get a good discount.Instead of being a must do attraction in London, you must be prepared to stand some time in lines. So, if you dont have much time, i suggest you visiting a museum.",What a huge waste
"April 15, 2017","The London Eye is the biggest tourist trap in London - literally. You wait on line for at least 30 minutes to buy a ticket to get on another line for at least an hour to get on the eye for approximately 20 min. Not worth the ticket price, not worth the views since all the windows are dirty. They should've left the skyline of London alone...",A must! Get the fast lane!
"April 14, 2017",Perfect! Nice vista of London in the nicest area of London. Sufficiently exciting for the kids and the adults too. Make sure to get the fast lane tickets. We bought ours as a twofer online when buying the tickets to Madame Tussaud's. It's really worth it to get fast lane tickets--especially when you're with kids. During Easter peak time we spent only three minutes from entering the queue to boarding a pod. Easily accessible from Waterloo station with a cool playground next to it and a nice riverside walk with the best view of Parliament and Big Ben.,Boat tour great
"April 14, 2017","Very interesting way to see London. Good tour and information about all the bridges. Boat is massive so no fear of sea sickness! Pleasant in the evening when quiet, probably wouldn't be as enjoyable when packed with people.It's also a nice rest after walking all day!",Evening view of London
"April 14, 2017","Great view, really is spectacular.My advise would be to go in the evening. We didn't have to queue for longer than ten/fifteen minutes and to be honest the sunsetting over the city was amazing! ",Great ride and views!
"April 14, 2017",A must see if you visit London.  Highly recommend you buy a ticket prior to arriving.  It will save you a ton of time waiting in line.  The views are totally worth the wait.,Tourist trap - not worth the money
"April 14, 2017",Extremely expensive - not worth the money. Even with pre bought fast track tickets we were standing in queue two times. First when collecting the tickets. Secondly when entering the capsules. In addition to paying approximately 200£ for two adults and three children you are asked to pay extra for pictures taken before you enter the capsule. A tourist trap of massive dimensions.But nice view from the top. ,Beware of the booking system
"April 13, 2017","I had read many of the London Eye reviews before I booked on the morning of the visit, but none of them really did justice to the length of the queues, or the complicated options you gave in trying to book when you're on a budget and wondering if you really can trust the optimists. Lesson 1 - get the TICKET and bit the ticket receipt on your phone or, on a piece of paper, before you visit. We spent 25 minutes in a queue to 'collect' or ticket from the ticket desk AFTER we'd paid for it at our hotel and had that receipt. Lesson 2. Buy the fast track upgrade and get your allocated time before you visit. You can pay even more for a flexi ticket, but lessons 1 & 2 will make the buildup as painless as possible. Unless you have 2 hours to spare, so anything else to save money. ","Disappointed, it wasn't the treat expected "
"April 12, 2017","Had looked forward for a long time to go on the ""Eye.""  I visited with my 2 children aged 10 and 12 as a treat in the Easter holidays, we went to London on the train for the day.I pre bought and ordered the tickets weeks before going to London using my Tesco vouchers and paying £10 each on top. I picked the time slot which would best suit our day.  However it seemed a waste of time on the day as we had to queue for over an hour to get on the Eye.  The only way to get in the shorter queue was to either have merlin passes or pay even more for ""fast track"" but I thought we'd paid enough!Once on the Eye,  the capsules are full of people, so unless you pick your view when you get on you could end up looking at the steel poles holding the wheel together for most of the ride. All together our trip took over an hour and three quarters, I think we could have spent our money more wisely and done something more interesting with our time,  the view wasn't great really either unfortunately. I would like to try the ""sky garden"" next time and apparently it's free! I don't know how much the Eye is usually for a full price ticket but I'm glad I didn't pay more than £30 for three of us. ",Great view.
"April 12, 2017",Enjoyed the experience of the London Eye during our stay. A must if you want to see the city from above.,Fantastic
"April 12, 2017","Amazing experience!We purchased our tickets ahead of time using a coca cola attractions pass (£51 for Madam Tussauds, Aquarium and Eye... much cheaper than buying individually) We visited on Wednesday 5th of April at approx 5pm and only waited about 15 minutes.My daughter got very nervous and upset when the wheel started to move but she came around and really enjoyed the beautiful views on the journey around.I'd like to applaud the safety checks that were involved prior to getting on the wheel and the checks they done of the pods when everyone came off... very reassuring. I would totally reccomend the wheel to anyone visiting London.",There are more important places to visit in London
"February 16, 2017","Londons eye view is always a perfect experience but you still have more and cheaper ways to enjoy it, ideally with a drink at one of the skyscrapers",Wedding proposal
"February 15, 2017",Lovely wedding proposal venue!You take great pics too!Ride is 30 minutes enough so you don't get bored,London eye and river cruise
"February 15, 2017",Excellent venue. Even though visibility wasn't perfect due to weather the views were great. River cruise was very enjoyable. Worth a trip. The guide in the river cruise was excellent and very informative.,"Definitely would recommend, but expensive at full price"
"February 15, 2017","We purchased as part of a 2 attraction pass so only worked out to be £10 each. Good value for £10 each but expensive at full price. There are so many discounts for the Eye that nobody should be paying full price.We went on a busy day, but later in the afternoon so the crowds were low. Waited 20 minutes, but this is good for London.We did the 4D experience first, but wasnt to impressed with it. I think its just a way to try to justify the full price ticket prices. Would recommend just missing it.The Eye itself is great. Lasts 30 minutes and even in the poor weather we had was still good.I read some previous poor reviews and had to laugh at some comments.   'Takes ages to go around' - Well thats the idea, if you want a fast ride then go to a theme park.   'bad idea if you need the toilet' - If you cant last an hour without the toilet, then see the doctor.   'boring' - Its meant to be relaxing, away from the choas of London streets. If you cant stand still and enjoy a few minutes piece and quiet, then dont get on.",Eye of the world
"February 14, 2017","Fantastic experience,  a must see and do when you are in London,  will be taking my granddaughter to London in July and will be going on the London Eye again with my granddaughter. ",Amazing attraction
"February 13, 2017",This is a must to see London! We booked out tickets online and paid for priority tickets. I recommend this as the queue for normal ticket looked very long that would take about an hour to hour and half to get through. The staff were very polite and the view were amazing. The day we went on was slightly foggy but still saw the beauty of London. The only down point was the purchase a photo was £20 for one which we felt was pretty steep. Apart from that amazing and we loved it. ,Amazing
"February 13, 2017","We had trouble initially booking tickets to go on the eye, as when we tried to use the website on our phones you couldn't just buy a ticket to go on the eye it was only offering package deals i.e with a river cruise or a valentines champagne package.  When we eventually figured it out we decided to leave it till our last afternoon as you could pick a time slot, we chose 13:15 - 13:45 as we had a train to catch at 16:10.  When we arrived to pick our tickets up we were told to go outside and wait in the queue and it would take roughly an hour which as a bit strange considering we picked a time slot which turns out is only to pick up the tickets not enter the ride.  So just be a bit careful.",Great views from the eye
"February 13, 2017",Worth booking in advance as the queues for last minute tickets can stretch for what looks like miles!! Once on the pod the journey is really smooth and as it travels slowly so the view constantly changes. As it reaches the top the views are amazing across London and I would say do not miss the chance to go on the London Eye if you have never done it before.,Must Do!
"February 12, 2017",The queues can look quite daunting but they are very well organised and move quickly. The pods themselves are spacious and they don't load too many people into each one so you can move about and take in the 360 degree views of the City. There are tablets which you can use to find out about the Landmarks you can see. It is well worth the money (as long as it isn't foggy) and I'd recommend doing it during the day and of a night as London is just as beautiful then.,Great area to visit for a family
"February 11, 2017",We took our kids to the London Eye. Don't use Apple maps to get you there. It will send you to the hospital nearby. The views are beautiful and definitely get the pictures afterward. Well worth it!,A very long wait
"March 2, 2017",Very disappointed that we had to queue for over 30 minutes to collect tickets and then a further 30 minutes to actually get onto the eye. Would have expected a better system in place to deal with the numbers and customers to be given the expectation that although booked for a certain time you wouldn't be on the eye at that time.,CUSTOMER SERVICE AWFUL !!
"March 2, 2017","Don't book for this on line if you don't want to risk my experience.I booked tickets on line and they didn't arrive. It is virtually impossible to phone, so I emailed their so-called customer service. Unfortunately they take five days to reply and I was going in four days. Sure enough, the day after I had watched my friends enjoy the ride (during our supposed allotted time slot) I received an email saying they hoped everything had been sorted out to my satisfaction and that I had enjoyed the experience.Unbelievable.I have since written to tell them what happened (some weeks ago now) and have had no reply.I wouldn't book any of these London attractions online in future, if you do ...be warned!",Birthday
"March 2, 2017",A must the view from the Eye is amazing you can see the whole of London even on a grey day.Dont be put off if there is a wait to get on,Denied entry after an hour queing
"March 1, 2017","My Family visited the London eye on 25/02/17, after collecting several tokens from the Sun newspaper. We then proceeded to queue for over an hour.When we finally got to the front of the line, we were greeted by a rather miserable attendant who refused entry for my family and i due to the fact their booking system didn't have our booking code on the system. I then asked to speak with a manager, who was also not very helpful and stated there was absolutely nothing she could do to rectify the situation.","VIP Champagne Experience ride very good but ""check-in"" a shambles."
"February 27, 2017","We booked for the Champagne Experience. On getting there it was not at all clear where we had to go to check in. Lots of staff to ask but all said go there, go here, go everywhere but the right place. No signs except for normal and fast track. In the end we found a member of staff who told us where to go. Then there was a long queue and only two staff on the computers. All a shambles which could have been avoided by having  signs for the VIP type rides. For a special celebration it began as a great disappointment. However, once checked in it was very good. Our hostess, Ruby, was great. General queues horrendous so leave yourselves loads of time. For VIP go to the door overlooking the River Thames that has a faded scarlet awning. ",Nice
"February 24, 2017",Nothing special. There is a huge line. Price high. Good if you want to get oriented. Good only in sunny day.,Family holiday 
"February 21, 2017",Although i don't like heights and was frightened of going into a Pod that went that high I truthfully wasn't scared !! Was a great experience to see all of London !! Bought the photo too as a wee keep sake !! Although a huge queue was well worth the visit 😊,So Expensive
"February 20, 2017","The London Eye is a lovely contribution to London's tourist destination's. I went on it once and never again. The cost of two adults and two children comes short of a £100,the actual cost today 2017 is £90 for a family of four. So ridiculously over priced I don't recommend it to nobody.. Go to a restaurant instead.. The price for adults should be £8 and children £4. The government should force the owners to lower their prices or shut up shop.. It's a rip off, just to go round in a circle.. The best of rip off London..",Definitely worth it
"February 19, 2017","The London Eye was our first attraction during our recent visit to London. The wait in the regular queue was about an hour, so we decided to buy the Fast track tickets (£34,95). In our opinion it was worth paying the extra £10, to avoid the queue. Please keep in mind that you also have to queue to buy your tickets (Fast track queue was hardly any wait, regular ticket queue about 20 min). We didn't book our tickets in advance because we were not sure about the weather conditions. Once on board you have enough space to move around and enjoy the stunning views. It gives a great impression of the city and all it's beautiful sites. The entire journey is about half an hour. We enjoyed it immensely!",Great experience 
"February 17, 2017","Pre-booked our tickets online well in advance and visited the London Eye on 14th Feb. We waited in line for about 20 mins. It was a great experience, lots to look at, the kids loved it.",Wonderful night view
"February 10, 2017","No surprises here! A fairly expensive ticket gets you an excellent view. You likely know your families preferences and value/reward spectrum. If you really want to ""get your money's worth"" and are hyper sensitive to expense....this probably isn't the ride for you. If you spend money freely for experiences on vacation, then this is another solid option. I'll likely give ""The Shard"" a look next time. ",Great view
"February 5, 2017",Great view but the there was a crazy quew to get in. It is a nice experience to see London from the top but there are many other places that can give you the same view.,Worth the wait!
"February 4, 2017",Even though I am scared of heights I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The views are out of this world! We queued about 45 mins to get on with standard passes. Staff very efficient. ,Ticked Off the List: So That's That.
"January 29, 2017","Going up so high over a city like London you'd expect to be blown away. London is beautiful, but unless you know where you're looking, you're really not getting much. A major disappointment for me was not being able to see the Tower or Tower Bridge, I didn't realise they'd be blocked. Westminster and the Abbey were the highlight, with St. Paul's a lovely sight also.This would really be best for 'locals' as the sun went down. You get views in other cities, but these cities can have the backdrop of mountains and boast a promenade. London does not feature these. Perhaps you simply are too high on this? Or perhaps London is simply best enjoyed from the ground.I'm glad that I did it, but I won't be doing it again.",Thought would be better?
"January 12, 2017","After the over an hour queue with prebooked timed tickets, we climbed into a pod. Lots of noise, in all languages, pointing out the sights of London as as we slowly started to circle. Perfect day sunny/cold so had great views. Halfway through noise and excitement levels had dropped, as you can only look at the same views from different heights for so long?!Tick that off!",weekend in london
"January 6, 2017",went for a trip round london.. bought tickets b4 we arrived . to save queeing on the london eye so was easier ..glad we did,Enormous queue
"January 4, 2017","The London eye is brilliant,the only thing letting it down is the queuing system. I have previously visited on a weekday and walked straight on. This time I visited on a Saturday afternoon and was obviously expecting it to be much busier. I reserved tickets online and was told to expect around a 45 minute queue. The queue to collect the tickets was around 1 hour and then the queue to get on was another 2 hours. I even missed the train home. The queue is grim, outside on the pavement with overflowing bins. A better queuing system is badly needed. Its a shame as its an amazing attraction and the views at night are beautiful.",Wow
"January 19, 2017","To be honest, I thought it would be boring with long queues and poor views. I was wrong. First thing in the morning is often quiet and our weight was less than 20 minutes. We could see all that there was to see. Usually souvenirs are poor quality and expensive. We were pleasantly surprised that they were far better than expected. Souvenir photographs are usually a rip off, so it was totally unexpected,that the price included a hard back book to hold the pictures.I thoroughly recommend the trip.",See the city from a unique view
"January 19, 2017",Well worth the time. Breathtaking views. Top attraction if you like a perspective from the air. Really enjoyed it.,Beautiful views
"January 19, 2017",Visited the London eye with friends on a hen do. The queues were long but went down very quickly. There were lots of beautiful views of London. I think it's one of those experiences that once you have done it once there would be no need to do it again but defiantly worth having one go on it.,Enjoy from across the Thames
"January 18, 2017",The experience was fine however not worth the money.  The area around the eye is very crowded and although we didn't wait in the queue I don't feel it was worth in.,Great eye experience 
"January 15, 2017",Just after the new year our family was given the ride the eye and river thames tours. As long as the line was the staff was well organized and efficient. It took 30 minutes to get on and we had a nice experience. The weather was partly sunny and we could see for miles. Both my girls were not scared at all. Thx it was fun and so was the 40 minutes on the river.,New Years Eve
"January 14, 2017",Visited here for New Years Eve and it really was an amazing experience! The fireworks went off for around 10 minutes and were absolutely spectacular!There was a DJ that played music and hyped up the crowd!Is defiantly something that everyone must experience!!,A 'Must Do' experience
"January 4, 2017","We eventually got round to doing the London Eye. We booked on-line but don't waste time trying to shop around for discounted tickets, they do not exist unless you are travelling into London on the over ground train network. We booked a time slot but still had to queue for about 35 minutes. Of course you can not guarantee the weather, so clear sky's and sunshine is a bonus rather than a necessity.Drinks and sweets are available to buy, but we took our own as we were celebrating my wife's birthday. Once inside your pod, don't be shy. I got everyone to sing Happy Birthday and everyone joined in. There is a lot to look at in every direction so move around as much as possible.Terrific views in every direction but the whole experience is over far to quickly. Having said that, you only need to do it once!",Great Views
"January 3, 2017","We booked ahead of time before arriving to London and got a deal for 3 attractions. Our first attraction was the London Eye and it was pretty impressive. So we tried to book it for a sunset view, but to our luck the sun wasn't out that day. + the check in experience was smooth and quick, they move the lines rather quickly. We waited about 15 minutes before we were able to board. + amazing unobstructed views of London from above. If you're lucky, there won't be too many people in your capsule or hopefully they alternate so everyone gets good shots. Overall I would recommend doing the London Eye. Be mindful, that the capsule moves slow, so once you get a full lap around you'll be getting off. The capsule never stops unless their are kids or people with disabilities. Getting one while it was moving, was pretty fun too!",Always Fun
"January 3, 2017",Went at sunset over the Holidays.  Beautiful views of the city.  Get fast track.  Go in the evening.  Big tourist destination but what isn't in London,Great View of the City
"January 2, 2017","A nice way to see the City from a birds eye view.  The line was short, no need to buy the express pass tickets when we visited.  We did unknowingly, not a big deal but unnecessary.  Fantastic views with good photos of Big Ben.  Nice place to walk in the evening as well.","London eye was good, the Eye lounge was not! "
"January 1, 2017","Me and my other half decided to treat ourselves to the champagne experience on the London eye, the deal where you get a glass of bubbly in the Eye lounge beforehand and then another glass when you're on the eye.The queueing was a bit of drama. I wasn't aware that I could use the fast track queue so went to the normal queue and waited but once I got to the front, they couldn't help me and said I had to use the fast track queue, so again I had to wait! I don't know why they couldn't get the tickets for me seen as I had already queued!I was very disappointed when I saw the Eye Lounge, I was expecting something quite luxurious seen as it was part of the London eye! But looked like they had just rented out a function room in a hall and had this very cheap looking pop up bar and chairs randomly spread out! The London eye itself was good made better by the bubbly and lovely tour guide.",View with Champagne 
"January 1, 2017","So glad we booked the London Eye with the champagne experience.  Make your reservation in advance and avoid the wait in line and it's limited to 25 people in the capsule.  It's a slow and smooth ride with a guide explaining the sights. We booked late afternoon and saw the sunset, perfect timing.Warning:  be sure to let the staff know upon checking in the line that you have advance reservations for the ""champagne experience, fast track ticket"".  We were advised by two staff members to wait in the wrong line and almost missed our boarding time.",Wouldn't pay full price - we have a merlin pass
"January 1, 2017","We've been up the eye many many times. In recent years we've had a Merlin pass so it's effectively free. I certainly wouldn't pay full price for it as it's jolly expensive. With the Merlin pass you can skip the huge queues which is rather convenient. Our 10 year old loves going in the eye and seeing the sights of London. There is always something new to spot. I would certainly recommend going on it. If you are scared on heights, once you sit down you don't feel/see the height. I wouldn't recommend it if you were claustrophobic as you are in the pod for 30 minutes and can't get off.",Hotel Chocolat and proseco event
"November 21, 2016","Decided to treat the missus to an early birthday present and took the hotel chocolat package, which included chocolate samples, an informative tasting guide, two glasses of prosecco and  revolutions round the wheel. Worth every penny and not expensive if you consider the price of one rotation on the wheel. Cant recommend it enough.",Great Experience 
"November 19, 2016",In London for the weekend and decided to put a ride on the London Eye top of the list of things to do. We weren't disappointed as it was a fantastic experience with great views of all London. Such a smooth ride you really didn't notice you were moving or how high you were. Happily recommend a ride for all London visitors. ,Eye
"November 19, 2016",Everything it said it would be.I went at night which was magical. Worth booking online to plan your trip and time slot. Take a bottle of water for summer visiting. ,Very nice view... that's all folks!
"November 19, 2016","This is certainly one of the best ways to have a panoramic view above the Thames. We did it at sunset, it was really beautiful! But the queue is relatively long for an attraction that lasts about 20 minutes... Furthermore, the windows are excessively scratched, which spoils a little the observation and the photos. It's expensive for what it is.",view of city
"November 15, 2016",went on the eye after a days sightseeing trip at first thought a long queue but it was fast moving when we went on it was still light but time we were on it got dark so got the best of both daytime and night views would recommend you went on at same time capsules very spacious so you can move around with ease and see all the landscape at 20 pound not to dear for a london attraction,"Pricey, but it's an experience!"
"November 14, 2016","Thought it was a bit pricey to simply get into a capsule and go around once. However, I did splurge.  Highly recommend going at night...my daughter and I had great views. The lights made the scenery come alive versus drab gray buildings.",Eye of the Beholder
"November 10, 2016","Able to be seen from many parts of London, on clear days, is the London Eye.  Its enormous wheel with support spokes and glass pods moves through the air with ease.  It is a must for a grand finale in London.My niece and I booked tickets online.  It was for a ride in front of the line with a glass of champagne at 8:00 PM.  We waited no more than 10 minutes and got on.  Don't expect to ride this package alone.   We were with at least 12 people.  So, for a special occasion, request to be alone.The ride is as smooth as silk.  The 360 degrees view is spectacular.  You can see how impressive the landmarks are from the air.  Our tour guide took pictures and was very hospitable.   He also had a great wit.The tour is approximately 30 minutes or less.  There is a bench to sit on.  No lack of views on this ride and it has computer screens to check what you are observing.We went on Halloween night and it was wonderful.  Purchase your tickets online to avoid lines.  There are also souvenir shops and food close by.  Don't miss it, but hold out for the final day if your stay, but check weather first!  Beauty is in the Eye!",Fantastic views
"November 2, 2016","Thoroughly enjoyed this , we did go in october half term week so yes it was very very busy, but to be fair the weather was good and it didn't actually take that long to board.

"October 30, 2016",Booked our tickets online for the London eye and river cruise (saved 10%).  Collected our tickets from the machine in the box office.  You just need to swipe your card that you used to book your tickets and the tickets are printed there and then.  The queue was about 30 minutes long for the London eye but was well worth the wait.  Amazing views of London.,Really Amazing Structure! Well Worth a Visit! Great Views!
"October 19, 2016","This wheel is really an amazing feat of engineering. We purchased our tickets online in advance, which I would recommend. We also paid extra for the ""fast track"" tickets that allow users to cut the line, as well as the ""any time, any day"" option. This gave us flexibility in case it was raining or overcast. A handy thing since the queue area is not covered, and there was a long line for the stand by tickets. We were loaded into our capsule in a fairly short amount of time. There was approx. 20 people in the capsule and the wheel moves continuously. It's a very well run attraction. The views are really great. You can walk around in the capsule and take pictures. The capsule is air conditioned and the trip is very smooth. Would do it again when in the area.",panoramic views!
"October 18, 2016","I've been on this four times - My son enjoyed it when he was and it entertained us a couple of times more recently - and my husband wanted to experience it so we went on together. Don't be put off by the queues - it moves super fast. It is pricey for 30 minutes but you do get to see the whole of London and can recognise the sights. It is not frightening - even if you hate heights, although I see one review does not agree with this. The glass all around feels v safe and no, it does not swing about! The only odd bit is jumping on and off while it is in motion - the movement is very very slow and there is no way you could fall but psychologically a bit weird, like one of those paternoster lifts only slower. I liked seeing old London juxtaposed with new and you can see the tops of buildings - St Thomas's hospital and the whole of the river from a unique angle - you can see Buckingham Palace and even Canary Wharf. Get the 'Map' postcard to tell you what you are looking at. Don't bother if there are heavy clouds or fog though! (It's air-conditioned if it is hot!)",Amazig views of London
"October 18, 2016",Got to see London from above. If yoyu are afraid of height or claustrophobic don't try. It takes 30 minutes to go all they way around. You get breathtaking views from up above.,No good if you don't like heights
"October 18, 2016","We went on the London eye this summer.. we didn't queue for long and when we got on it , it travels really slow.. as the chamber started to climb I was ok until just over half way .. when we reached the top I felt so ill I had to sit down and it's a shame really as my husband took all the photos which he's not good at and I could only see what I had missed out on looking at a few photos... I wouldn't go on it again ad it's expensive for the ride . But at least I can now say I've done it..",Panoramic View of London
"October 18, 2016","Buy tickets online as part of the London Attraction. Take in amazing views of Thames River, Big Ben etc. After the half an hour ride.. take a stroll along the southbank where there are other attractions too..",The View!!
"October 17, 2016","I had the opportunity to finally see London from the top, and oh what a view!!!As a lover of a great architecture, London as it all. The House of Parliament, The Thames etc. Walking  distance to major train stations,shopping,restaurants  and other entertainments...",It's a big Wheel
"October 16, 2016","The problem with this attraction is that it's more impressive on the ground than it is on the wheel. the views are not great, the queue to enter is long and the price is high. Oh wheel, if you've not done it you my feel you've not 'done it', but be happy wondering what it's like from the embankment.","A nice experience, but definitely not worth the price"
"October 16, 2016","It's nice to see London from up above, but not for 25 pounds! I'll rather go to a nice restaurant...",A 'must see'
"October 15, 2016","Heard a lot, both positive and negative experiences but I am glad we went up anyway. We got the tickets online combined with Madams Tussauds for 78 £ for both of us. Eye is worth the money. Lines can be a bit long, but moving fast. Capsules are not crowded so you get a pretty good view. And the view is absolutely divine. You're up in the sky for half an hour, so you get a good perspective of beautiful London and how huge it really is.",OUTSTANDING!
"October 14, 2016","The 30 minute ""flight"" on the London Eye was incredible.  A wonderful, panoramic view of London and the Thames.  Well worth the time and effort get to this location.",Love the view
"October 30, 2016",Every time I visit London I make sure that I visit London eye the view from the top is amazing you can see the river and all the major landmarks of London. That's suitable for all ages and I'm guessing the best time to visit would be right before sunset that would be very cool,Great views of London and a good experience
"October 29, 2016","My wife and I visited on a recent trip to London and choose the champagne experience. We were fast tracked to our pod but still had to queue when was a bit disappointing. However, our guide Arnie made the whole pod experience great with his knowledge and affable manner. It made the 30 min trip go quickly. We then went to our cocktail at the Eye Bar which seemed to be a pop-up bar in the London Eye building.All in all a good experience I would recommend.",Brilliant ...even if terrified of heights!!
"October 28, 2016","Second visit to the London Eye but did a twilight/night ride this time which was better for those with a fear of heights!!   We used our Merlin passes and were able to have priority whcih meant avoiding much queuing which was welcomed on such a busy half-term Oct afternoon.   Be prepared to get frisked, bag searched but all good and to be expected.Beautiful views on a clear dusk evening and saw many lit up landmarks of course, Big Ben and Houses of Parliament but also further afield too.Staff very friendly too.",Don't be upset if you miss it
"October 28, 2016",Its a London landmark and its fairly cheap especially if you mix it with other attractions. But if the queue is long and you have seen a sprawling city I would suggest not waiting in line for an hour for a 20 min ride but head to another attraction. Its average ,Have the champagne!
"October 27, 2016",The London Eye.  A worthwhile attraction particularly if you pay the NOMINAL upcharge to add champagne and go to the lounge.  SKIP THE LINE and have a great experience.  Two thumbs up.  ,Loved it!
"October 27, 2016",You can't visit London and go on the London Eye.  We went on at night and the views of the city all lit up were amazing.  We queued for about 20 minutes and weren't disappointed',Fun
"October 27, 2016",Good view from Above . we had great weather so clear views all around. Lots of photo shots and very smooth ride.,Champagne and breath-taking views!
"October 24, 2016",We decide to splurge and have the champagne tour- it was totally worth it. We also didn't have to wait in a cue- probably a function of the fact that it was 5 pm on a Wednesday in October but in reading other reviews I was surprised that we just walked right on at our reservation time. The views really are spectacular and it was the first thing we did after we checked into our hotel.  Great way to start off a wonderful trip.,The London Eye
"October 24, 2016",It is one of the landmark in London which you should visit it. They have tow types of tickets ( normal and VIP). You will see both Thames river sides. You will enjoy.,A must for first time with children
"October 23, 2016",Fantastic view of London from above. If you orderered your tickets by the internet first you have to get them from the ticket office and then stay on the second line to enter.,Great experience
"October 12, 2016",Wonderful views over London from London Eye. Queues not too long. Very stable you didn't feel any rocking,Amazing views 
"October 11, 2016","If your going on the London eye, the only thing that really matters is the view! It's a shame there's so many people bunked in to one capsule at a time and the picture taken at the end is usually shared with other randoms however the views are beautiful and it makes up for it all! ",Weather dependent
"October 11, 2016","We booked the river cruise and the eye experience which I would recommend. We sat inside on the boat because it was cold and felt as if it was going to rain (which it did), the tour guide had a dad sense of humour and engaged with passengers well, trip was scenic and covered main tourist destinations. We then qued for the London Eye, it was spitting rain but we were prepared with rain jackets, the que moves at an okay pace but I wouldn't be booking anything afterwards as its unpredictable. You're in the capsule with a group of other people so be polite offer to take pictures for them and you'll have a nice ride. Unfortunately we had left the eye until the last day in London which happened to be cloudy and raining it was still great and we were able to see everything it was just harder to take pictures and not as aesthetically pleasing.",The best way to see London
"October 10, 2016","I booked my ticket as part of a package deal online with a visit to Madame Tussauds for £40 online, a value for money deal. The tickets were valid for up to three months. I visited Madame Tussauds in July and decided to save the London Eye for another day as I was too tired from travelling to visit both on the same day. So I visited at the beginning of October, when the weather was still reasonably sunny and mild. At Madame Tussauds they gave me a voucher for the London Eye with my purchase, so when I visited the kiosk near the London Eye I exchanged the voucher for a priority ticket as I had already paid in advance. The queues are very long, mind you and if you buy your tickets at the desk on the day, it's a long wait. You will be body-scanned before entry into the pods and your bags checked by security. I don't recommend buying food at the kiosk though as it is likely to be expensive, as it always is with attractions like these. Once inside the pod, the ride takes about 35 minutes. When soaring above London, you are guaranteed wondrous views of Big Ben/Houses of Parliament, Horse Guards Parade, Buckingham Palace, Downing Street, OXO Tower, BT Tower, London Bridge, River Thames and many more sights synonymous with London. There are photo opportunities too. Prices a rip-off at £20 per photo, but if presented in a special keepsake photo album, it's £25. All in all, an enjoyable day out. I'd recommend this attraction to any tourist who wants to visit London.",London Eye
"October 7, 2016","Best tip is pre-purchase tickets as the queue was very long for a week day visit. Quite expensive for a short ride about 30mins but spectacular views down the Thames, Houses of Parliament, Big Ben etc. Likely a must do in London (as per Eiffel Tower in Paris).",Slow and boring
"October 7, 2016",It doesn't worth the money and the long queue.You have much better places to visit in london. No doubt about it!!!,A pricey but fun tourist activity 
"October 6, 2016","We did it as the end of our last day sightseeing in London. The access to the Eye always seems crowded and the surrounds dirtier and cheesier than other parts of the main tourist areas but once you overcome this obstacle, even the longest queues move fast and before you know it, you'll be soaring above the City in a pod. We had about 15 people to the pod, which didn't seem crowded. The height is surprising and the view gorgeous - and it's a different  icon to throw in the mix of your London pilgrimage. ",Spectacular 
"October 4, 2016",Spectacular view of the city and all its attractions.  Located on the banks of the Thames river you get great unobstructed views of the city from a birds eye view.,Fantastic views but......
"October 4, 2016","We were stuck on the Eye for 4 hours due to technical difficulties.  Information from staff  on the ground was useless.  16 people in the pod with a guide,  Klaudia, who was fantastic but unprepared for this situation.   Emergency provisions brought out which included 5 foil blankets, Lucozade tablets and paper potties.....not enough for everyone.Very frightening when all emergency services arrived and area cordoned off. When we finally got down, we were offered a diet coke and a bar of chocolate! !!!",Overrated 
"October 2, 2016",They charge an arm and a leg to get on this Ferris wheel and you have to share the cabin with about twenty other people. There are plenty of other (cheaper/free) places to get a birds eye view of London from. Not worth it.,Aa amazing time
"September 27, 2020","The queue wasn’t so big, we were waiting approximately for 10 min. After it was enjoyable to see London city from the highest view:)",I take all my visitors here!
"September 27, 2020","As a Londoner, I take anyone who visits on the London Eye.  I've been so many times now, but still don't tire of it.  Worth doing anything you can to pre-book and beat the queues however, because it can be a bit of a long wait....",Excellent as usual 
"September 27, 2020",This visit was excellent and the best as usual. I would like to give a huge thank you to Tilly one of the staff who made our visit even more fantastic. She gave me and our family a separate pod because it was my sisters birthday and she and all of us were very happy because of this. ,Amazing Service
"September 26, 2020",Had booked as a package deal but couldn’t book online for an extra experience at the time so we’re advised to go to customer service on the day to upgrade.Annoyingly that was not the case on arrival as fully booked ( gutted ) but the manager did arrange for a private pod at no extra cost!!! So kind and much appreciated and all the staff from start to finish were so so friendly especially  as we had a nervous passenger lol.The views were amazing and even though really high winds the pod felt safe. Only issue was the half and hour seemed like 5 minutes!!!!!!Can’t wait to return for a trip at a different time of day.Highly recommend and many thanks to all the staff - great experience- we loved it!!!!,Great experience 
"September 26, 2020",Loved going on the eye you could see so much of London! Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the beautiful city ,Good but a guide book or local info needed
"September 23, 2020","We loved this but I have to say not being from London, other than the obvious land marks like big Ben and the Palace I had no idea what else I was looking at.A little leaflet or place with info would be ideal to make the most of the experience.Other than that great 30/40 worth doing ",Nice wiew
"September 23, 2020",Very nice boat trip .well enjoyed.highly recomended.our boat guide very good .he's. Explained London history,Highly Recommend the Champagne Experience
"September 21, 2020","We had the pod to ourself with AJ was our host, the  experience was excellent  the champagne was chilled,, the afternoon was sunny and clear, and what a spectacular view of London, AJ was a charming host, polite and very informative, would highly recommend.",Amazing
"September 20, 2020","This is amazing,if you come to London,you must find time and go to famous London Eye and visit this place. All the best.",Bit warm 
"September 20, 2020",Some great views of London we had a hot hot day was starting to get uncomfortable in the pod with the heat I much say made us feel safe we had our own pod with sanitizer staff where helpful ,Excellent
"August 11, 2016",This was definitely on our to do list in London and it lived up to our expectations. Phenomenal view right around. Moves at a good pace for you to appreciate the whole 360' view.,Needs better Q management with shelters.
"August 10, 2016",When compared to Singapore flier the Q arrangements is very poor. There must be protection shelter from rain and Sun. The souvenir sales section is crowdy and it can be relocated.,Interesting tourist visit site for family.
"August 10, 2016","The great Ferris wheel near the river with 443 feet (135 m) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 394 feet (120 m). It's a great place for family or couple to go. The wheel spins slowly and gives you view from a great site to the whole city, including the Big Ben which is near to the London Eye. They also take pictures before boarding and in the cabin as a souvenir photobook or keychain, which you can decide if you want to buy or not. The average waiting time to get on is about 30 minutes. Would not recommend you're travelling alone.",Great Experience
"August 9, 2016",Did the London Eye Champagne Experience. There were 9 of us and it was so much fun. Great views and great company. Time went by very quickly. Kids enjoyed it as well. Definitely worth pre-booking.,The bird's perspective
"August 8, 2016",It is definetly worth a visit. You get to see London from a totally different perspective. It moves really slow so you don't miss the shots. I would recommed to book your tickets in advance and combine it with one or two attractions. This would make it cheaper and booking the fast lane is also a good idea. The queues can be very long.,A beautiful view of the city
"August 7, 2016","An iconic structure in itself, the London Eye on the south bank provides a beautiful view over the city. At almost £25 for advance tickets it is not cheap for the 35 minutes it takes to complete a circle, but worth a visit.",Nothing special
"August 4, 2016","You pay a lot, you queue long, but you see whatever you already saw just from a slightly different angle. Spend your money better for the street artists just below the London eye.","Boring, not worth the wait or money "
"August 3, 2016","Would not recommend unless you are a tourist with money to burn. The queues are long, it goes far too slowly.  By the time we got to the top we wanted to get down. Better off taking s photo from distance and spending money on something else. Kids were bored and ended up playing on my phone. ",Great views
"August 3, 2016","Great views on a clear day, if you don't like heights, like me, it's fine. Been on it 3 times now. Tickets - don't queue up in the big ticket office we got ours as a joint ticket at the river cruise ticket office, under 4's go free.",Gin Tonic Experience
"August 2, 2016","I booked a GinTonic experience which includes fast track, 2 rotations, 2 GT's and some savory snacks. This was a lovely experience, thanks to our guide who explained a lot about the surroundings. The 2 rotations were perfect, since we were all taking pics at the first rotation and did not actually fully enjoyed the view. The second rotations allowed us to fully sink in the breathtaking views. Highly recommended!",The Art of Us
"February 11, 2020","The museum is a cornucopia for art lovers. Some of the artist exhibited are Michelangelo, Rubens, Raphael, Rembrandt, Gainsborough, Leonard da Vinci, and Van Gogh. Please get the audio guide, it often gives information on the origin story of many works of art.",My visit
"January 11, 2023","Sometime, during the year, I'd read the National Gallery would be having a Lucien Freud exhibiton of all of his paintings and drawings.  Everyone, who could go there during an evening, would be able to pay how much they could afford.  I was one of them.  But, I arrived half an hour too early but the person checking the tickets didn't mind.  I could take as much time as I liked to look round.  There were seats in the rooms for me to sit down.  There was a small shop, which sold the accompanying guide book, but I thought it was very expensive.  Afterwards, I was allowed to walk round the gallery seeing their paintings.  But, I couldn't stay long as the bus to the hotel didn't run all night.  So, I went back to Charing Cross underground station.",Amazing collection of beautiful art.
"May 16, 2022","This magnificent collection occupies a number of buildings on Trafalgar Square. Entry is free, there is a cloakroom with a modest fee per article stored for the visit. The complex is huge with good signage between the various galleries but it is easy to get lost. Lifts can offer an easier passage for those a little less mobile. It is worth doing your homework before attending so that you know what you wish to see or study and maximise your time spent there. It really is an amazing experience to be able to see your favourite works up nice and close. You may know the series of Venice by Canaletto but to see up close the detail in the small figures on the quays and boats leaves one in awe of the artist. Likewise the details in the ruffs and clothing from the Dutch Masters. Toilets are clean and well maintained and there are shops to do your art or souvenir shopping. A wonderful place to visit in London even if you are not overly interested in art or history. We visited twice over a week as one’s concentration tends to wane after a couple of hours.",Destination paintings.
"September 22, 2021","We travelled four hours round trip to visit the NG in a day and it was worth this and more. These are destination paintings and glorious. We spent over six hours here and still insufficient to see everything. We booked tickets online although you can just turn up but you may have to wait. You can still follow route A, B or C which was introduced after they reopened but thankfully you can now go your own route and we did. Mask wearing was encouraged and most had them on. The staff were beyond helpful and thoughtful, we interacted with several staff members and they were all lovely. We ate in the espresso bar, where the staff were equally kind and polite. The coffee and caramel brownie were delicious and reasonably priced for London. The shop had numerous books and cards to choose from. It was a wonderful visit. We joined as members and would encourage anyone who appreciates art to do the same. You get 10 % of the shop and cafe as well as free entry to the exhibitions. Moreover, it supports the gallery, well worth every penny!",Lucky to visit while it was so quiet
"August 4, 2020","Pre-booking required due to restrictions on visitor numbers. This means there is plenty of opportunity to get up close to the beautiful artwork, even the famous paintings. No pressure to move on. All staff friendly and helpful.",Artemisia
"October 27, 2020","Visited the Artemisia exhibition at the national today.Good queuing system and timed entry.The Artemisia exhibition itself did feel a little too busy; I don’t feel it felt any less busy than in ‘normal’ times and it was very difficult to maintain social distancing- although everyone was wearing masks.The paintings were amazing and having been a fan of Artemisia for a long time, it was great to see so many of her works. However, I felt they could have made it a bit more ‘young person’ friendly. When we went to see the Madonna of the Rocks exhibition, they had some excellent information about painting, light and shade etc... for my almost teenage daughters, it would have been great for some more visual/ interactive information about her painting techniques and her life. After the exhibition we took one of the planned routes out; these worked well and the rest of the gallery actually felt much emptier and more pleasant.",Lots of pictures!
"January 26, 2020","The national gallery is free which is amazing really. They ask for a donation as you go in which is fair enough. We went on a Saturday when it was quite busy. Many very cultured people spending ages looking at each picture and even taking pictures of the small explanation at the side of each one. So obviously some people think this place is the business! At the risk of sounding like I’m completely uncultured, there are an awful lot of paintings, many of which look fairly similar. (I know, I can hear many of you muttering in the background).There are some famous paintings in amongst all the others and those are the ones I wanted to see. However... I could have done with those being in a room all on their own.Sorry national gallery, you can’t win them all! ",A WHOLE LOT TO SEE for FREE!!!
"February 14, 2020","I chose to visit the Sainsbury Wing after reading an experienced guide's advice. This wing has a mostly pre-Renaissance and Renaissance artists along with the Dutch Masters, Reubens and El Greco. I paid for the audio guide (5BP) which was extremely helpful. I spent 5 hours in the Gallery altogether and was exhausted. I am sure the rest of the Gallery was as interesting as the Sainsbury wing. DON'T MISS THIS ONE!!!","Very nice gallery, definitely worth a visit"
"July 19, 2021","The gallery was very beautiful and easy to get to, The staff were mostly very helpful and understanding. There were some lovely paintings and I would definitely recommend the Monet and Van Gogh paintings. The only issue I had was the one way systems don't make sense and also don't allow you to see all of the room, they tend to make you choose between rooms and then you can't get back into the other ones because it's a one-way system. Luckily we had some very nice staff who allowed us to ignore the one-way system to get into the other rooms but it was quite confusing and stressful. Overall though a nice day out if you can navigate the Ikea like maze of routes. ",Beautiful museum with lots of fantastic artwork.
"August 5, 2021",Always a fantastic place to visit.  Easy to get lost - so do pick up a map or ask directions from some of the very helpful team who are all over the museum.  Some fantastic pieces to see and enjoy.  Some really famous paintings and some less famous but mesmerising.   In the current climate there are arrows so routes can be followed to help maintain some degree of social distancing. Masks are required.  I think if going with children it is better (if you are able to) to do a couple of shorter visits rather than one long one as otherwise there is a risk of them getting somewhat overloaded.  Really fabulous place to visit.,It's a ferris wheel
"July 22, 2016",Good views but the rotating nature of it means you won't get to spend much time enjoying the views. They also sell overpriced photos of you in the cabins - both a fake one and a real one that you pose for on the way down.Be smart and book your tickets online beforehand since its much cheaper and you can avoid one of two fairly long lines. ,Great views and pictures 
"July 22, 2016","Get up early and try to be there before 11 am, summer lines can be 2 hours or more. If you get there early no bed for fast access/fast pass. ",Third time on the eye - love it every time
"July 21, 2016",We visited on a hot July day using the Merlin Annual Pass - which was excellent as we were put straight in the fast track queue. Even though it was 31 degrees outside the pod was lovely and air conditioned.Fantastic views and a lovely smooth ride as always! My small son (4) was less interested in the landmarks but liked to look down at the nearby play ground and the water feature by the Royal Festival Hall that we had also visited that day so that kept him busy.Planning to go again and see London lit up at night in the future.,Incredible!!! 
"July 20, 2016",We came on the hottest day of the year and thankfully I'd pre purchased tickets for the champagne experience on the London Eye. We didn't have to wait outside queuing for ages in the scorching heat but instead picked our tickets up and were directed upstairs to the champagne bar where we bought a drink and waited for our host to collect us. When collected we were taken straight onto the London eye and given a glass of champagne! Lovely experience and so glad we upgraded as it meant we weren't melting outside!!!!  ,uninteresting
"July 20, 2016","long queqes, extremely slow moving, needs to be jazzed up to to make it interesting as a tourist attraction, as an engineer it was interesting, even my teenagers were unimpressed",Use your OWN EYES instead!
"July 20, 2016","The London Eye was recommended by a woman we met at one of our hotels so we decided to go. The lines and prices are so crazy, so we splurged and paid for the expedited line and £10 per person upgrade to bypass the line.The facility is pleasant enough and the air-conditioning was lovely.The weather was great so we could see far, but honestly there was nothing that we saw from above that warranted the tremendous cost (both money and time). Big Ben is gorgeous from the ground, so it's not necessary to see it from the air. Buckingham Palace looked like a grey library from above and wasn't impressive at all. When we walked to it and saw it on foot from the proper angle, it was lovely.In retrospect, we wish we hadn't done the Eye; it was a total waste of time and money.",Rained out
"July 19, 2016",Would have been a great experience if it had not been for the British weather gods to pour down on us. All we could see was the buildings and sites in close proximity. ,What a view
"July 17, 2016","We went on a champagne experience and had fast track through the massive queues, the view is truly fantastic, you don't know where to look first, was over too quickly.",Unexpected short wait
"July 16, 2016","Fabulous view, of course.  Take a very up-to-date map to work out all the newer buildings.We were recommended to visit around 6.30 for a shorter wait time and it worked perfectly.  There were just 3 of us, so we were moved forward in the queue to fill a space.  Total wait time was under 10 mins.  Be ready for the photo just before the finish.",A GREAT VIEW OF LONDON!
"July 11, 2016",YOU MUST come if you want to see the beautiful City London from the sky above. And it will be also GREAT if you can come at night which will be 10 times beautiful! And Big Ben under will also look great. And it's really a place that you MUST go.Good luck ,Stunning gallery
"January 1, 2020","We spent an hour touring the National Gallery.  Just right for us, Beautiful works of art with enough descriptions around the framed pieces to give us background on what we were seeing.  We spontaneously chose to pop in for a post-theater and pre-dinner viewing of the art during the festive December holiday season.  ",Beautiful gallery
"June 8, 2021","This is a must-see every time I’m in London. What a wonderful gallery, beautifully set up and with a good selection of art pieces spanning the centuries. You could easily spend a whole day just walking the halls although 3hours should do it for the casual visitor.Recently, I’ve been especially impressed by the COVID measures put in place: limited entry for bookings only, one-way walkways (that are actually monitored and enforced!) as well as required masks in all areas. Due to the slow drop-in of people it’s possible to enjoy the art more and feel like you have space around you. I felt very safe the whole time.",Superb guided tour
"March 16, 2023","We booked a tour guide to show us the highlights of the National Gallery, and it was definitely worth it. A 2.5 hour tour, we could then spend time in the gallery to view other pieces. A fantastic range of artworks, from da Vinci's Virgin of the Rocks to Holbein's The Ambassadors, Monet, Van Gogh and so many more. You could spend days in there - and of course, it's free! Incredible to see such a range of artwork without it costing a penny.",Centuries of Art for everyone.
"January 7, 2020","The National Gallery is probably my favourite museum in London.The collection is wide and various, everyone can find something interesting related to the pictorial side of art, because almost seven centuries are covered.I usually visit it for a really short time: the collection is huge and takes several hours, so it's better to take some time to admire just few artists and come back the day after with some more attention.It is completely free of charge for the permanent collection, so it's the best place to be when outside is too cold and you need some time to think about the beauty of the world.",Always Something New
"January 14, 2020",Our third visit and we are always amazed at what we discover in this beautiful museum. We toured the renaissance and medieval galleries and spent several hours viewing the many religious themed paintings. Totally worth the time and would return again. ,A must see London destination for locals and tourists alike
"September 7, 2021","A must see London destination for locals and tourists alike. We visited recently and really liked the online booking which ensured that the Gallery wasn't over crowded. I particularly liked following the three different routes which guided you through a series of must see art works by period. You can spend as little as an hour here just wandering or several hours viewing each room in turn. Not only is the art work spectacular, but the building itself is stunning.",Artist Leonardo da Vinci 'The Virgin of the Rocks' Experience a Masterpiece exhibition
"January 18, 2020","I happily went along to see artist 'Leonardo da Vinci' show, as a guest of a member of the National Gallery, expecting to be blown away.When we entered the 1st room, what we saw was two enlarged digital images of  landscapes, one either side of the room.These images had been blown-up to act as a backdrop, both you had to see through a wall made-up of open ended small metal squares, some of the squares had Leonardo's typed thoughts on paper. Neither of us were impressed .The second room we entered, had 3 light boxes with various objects in, all three had 4 gig sticks - that you had to move manually up or down to change the different shades of lighting, and a forth image was on a wall, this time you moved a semi circular light controller on a plinth. Yet another disappointing visual and manual activityThe 3rd room, was meant to refelt the artist studio, with all the paraphernalia and the image, one that automatically changed from outline digital canvas, colouring in the artwork, for my money, little more effort could have been done to create the studio atmosphere,  by adding some candelabra, fake or otherwise, instead the were angle poised lamps, yet another damp squidFinally the forth room, was the saving grace of the whole exhibition, with the artist Leonardo da Vinci second version of 'The Virgin of the Rocks' oil on poplar, that it is said was probably made to replace one (now in the Louvre, Paris) that Leonardo sold because the confraternity refused to pay him adequatley for it. A true masterpiece and this left me feeling, the concept was good but the implementation lack imagination",Amazing National Gallery
"January 28, 2020","Another fabulous free gallery in London that is definitely worth a visit! Escape the bustle of Trafalgar Square and enter an oasis of calm and beautiful paintings for the afternoon! My daughter recently studied art history in high school so this was a must-see on our list as she adored The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck. What's nice is there is a range of time periods represented so you can view Medieval Art, Renaissance up through the Impressionists (Monet, Van Gogh, etc). so there is something for everyone! The gallery walls are painted in deep, dark colors so the paintings really pop out - a visual delight!",Beautiful gallery
"January 1, 2020","We spent an afternoon here... it's a beautiful, world-class gallery with examples of all classic periods and styles, from the 13th Century to the 20th. Most of our favorite artists represented including Rembrandt, Pissarro, George Saurat, Picasso, Klempt, Monet, etc. Well worth the four hours spent. Also joined a free one-hour tour/lecture provided by the gallery. Very informative... I only wish it had been longer!",The name says it all.
"January 18, 2020","This Gallery is entitled to keep its name because it has the most seminal and magnificant and historically significant paintings of the British Isles, housed in these wonderful buildings in the centre of the capital city.  It repays countless visits.  I used to visit it as a student, and am delighted to find that half a century later it still can produce the authentic shivers of a true work of art.",A beautiful place to fulfill your love for arts
"January 22, 2020","A beautiful place to fulfill your love for arts. There is also wonderful vibes around, music, very friendly turist and locals, There so many things happening at the same time outside the gallery. That Is definitely a place  that you should visit. I loved it. ",Really good Rainy day option
"September 1, 2021","Love the National gallery as there is such a wide variety of paintings and masterpieces on display. Its just great to see so many master pieces that you learn about over the years. But also the building itself its utterly fantastic. Ticketing process is straight forward where you book a ticket online and then you get an email with a QR code in it. If you show up on the day they have a sign outside the main entrance which you can scan and it will take you through to the website. I spent about 1.5 hours inside just wondering through the rooms, they have three routes that you can follow and I think I covered all the rooms in my stroll around.",First Visit
"February 1, 2020",Having only become vaguely interested in art in the last year or so (I am early fifties) I had never visited before but my wife and I had a wonderful 2-3 hours walking around fairly haphazardly and thoroughly enjoying this time.How privileged we are to be able to enjoy such fine art for free (donations welcomed). We will definitely go back but maybe with more of a plan as there is so much to enjoy. Worth noting it is open later (9pm) on a Friday. ,Lots to see for art lovers
"February 11, 2020","Visited many times, usually to see a specific exhibition, but there are also talks of interest often relating to the current exhibitions. Loads of galleries showing art from different eras and a lot are free.  Once you've been here you will probably want to return.",Take time to enjoy the masterpieces
"April 10, 2020","Truly one of the world’s great art collections.  This is a museum to be enjoyed slowly.  Too many people rush through and miss some of the greatest treasures - including signature works by Rembrandt, da Vinci, Vermeer, Raphael, and Turner (among others).  Their dining rooms are a great place for a meal or snack.  ",A fantastic treasure chest
"March 6, 2020","Not many cities can offer a selection of masterpieces completely free.. So take advantage of this opportunity and visit the NG! Since entrance is free you don’t have to spend hours inside just to get your money’s worth: pop in to see some paintings, and maybe come back another day and look at another section. Italian masters are fantastic, great Turners and Constables and an impressive collection of Impressionist paintings! A good tip for quality gifts is the museum shop, it offers such a variety of items you wish you’d been there before buying all your souvenirs!",Perfect Post-Lock-down Gallery Visit.
"July 17, 2020","This was a lovely way to return to visiting galleries post lockdown.I was very pleased when The National Gallery reopened and booked an open visit-something which now needs to done.The organisation is excellent- well done to the director and staff!The queue is not long, and everyone was able to enter at their allotted time. There is a choice of three routes to follow.I chose Route B, which includes the Flemish/Dutch Old Masters and The Impressionists- both favourites of mine. The route is clearly marked and the lack of crowding makes it so much easier to view the works clearly and at leisure.The staff are helpful and the whole experience is calm and relaxed.I have already booked to visit the Titian exhibition next monthAll in all, a perfect return to London's wonderful art world!",Beautiful paintings
"March 9, 2020",If you love paintings then  you would love this place and you could quite easily spend 2-3 hours. The paintings are absolutely mesmerising  and appealing to all ages. The Gallery  encourage School trips and run exciting workshops.,A must for art lovers
"March 17, 2020","The National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery have a vast collection of portrais from all the best and most brilliant painters of all time. While you walk around the contless rooms displaying masterpieces you probably have never seen before, except in art books, you learn also a lot of the context, the history behind what you are seen. To visit the National Gallery is a must see for art lovers.",A national treasure
"February 25, 2020","One of the greatest collections in the world.  An incredible array of painters by all of the European masters. DaVinci, Rubens, van Dyke, Rembrandt, Constable, Turner, Canaletto, Raphael.  But my first reason for going is always to spend time in the impressionist galleries.  I think this diverse collection and the beautiful galleries/building that houses it are a must see for any art lover, but also a wonderful way to experience a gallery for the first time.  With free admission to the public every day and the central location of the gallery (hundreds of feet from the actual center of London) at the north edge of Trafalgar Square, it would be a shame not to go inside an experience even a small part of what the collection has to offer.",Never disappoints!
"April 29, 2022","If you wanted to see the entire collection, I do think you’d have to spend most of the day here - but as the admission is free, if you’re short on time it’s worth visiting even just to see a few rooms. Looking at a picture of a painting in a book or on a screen will never measure up to standing in front of it and seeing it in real life - I’ll always remember the first time I stood in front of ‘Whistlejacket’ and I make sure to see it every time I visit the gallery. The range of art on display means you’re sure to see something you like, and the gallery definitely holds up to multiple visits. The shop always has such a wide range of things to purchase. The price of exhibitions can be a little steep for those on a budget, but when I have paid for exhibition tickets in the past I haven’t been disappointed.","Historical collections, worth to visit"
"January 12, 2020","I spent only a few hours in the National Gallery, but was glad to manage to see Van Gogh, Picasso and Monet's original paintings with my own eyes.Lots os knowledge and history in this place. Need to spend a good few days to see them all.",World class gallery. And it's free! But you have to walk past shouting beggars.
"March 2, 2020","World class gallery. And it's free!  It has been some years since I was here. So long in fact, that the last time I was here I entered through the main doors, rather than through the modern building to the left. Not sure what advantage to the public it is to have to enter via the modern building, because there is now a long walk to get to the gallery popular. Also, I didn't like having to walk past the official beggars just inside the entrance who  want you to pay to enter a free gallery that we already pay for through our tax contributions. If the gallery want more money, they should ask the government, not the people. Imagine entering a hospital and having the same experience. Not nice.   A donation box is fine, but the shouting beggars are not.",Immersed myself with Monet masterpiece
"February 4, 2020",Had a great time studying and appreciates famous and talented work of arts by legendary and other amazing and talented painters. Looking at the art strokes can make oneself  going inside the picture and you in that place of the actual location of the paintings. Imagine that!,Extensive collection
"April 27, 2022","Firstly , it’s free to get in but you are welcome to leave a donation supporting the art. Although initially I saw a sign that said £24!, a quick Google and found out it’s free to enter although you do pay extra for the special exhibitions.What I did find is that a lot of the exhibits are very religious, not my cup of tea, but each to their own. Or of naked women with cherubs I think you can use your imagination. Again not my cup of tea.To get to the Van Gogh, Monet etc exhibitions you have to go to near the end of the gallery. But wow it was worth it.  I was shocked at the size of Monet’s water lilies. It’s absolutely massive. Probably 10 times the size I thought it would be. Although I didn’t think the actual painting quality was as good as I thought it would be. A little smudged, blurred perhaps. The Stubbs collection is excellent.I think what it taught me walking around is how talented these painters were. Whether the painting was my cup of tea or not. It’s hard to take in these are paintings and not photographs and how old they actually are. All this under one roof, amazing.I loved the mosaic floors near to the exit.Go through the doors to the outside and take some photos from the balcony, overlooking Trafalgar Square and Nelson Column spectacular.It’s well worth taking some time out of your day to visit.",A touch of enlightenment away from the shopping
"February 22, 2020","Right on Trafalgar square, the National gallery beckons, but I rarely respond. This time I walked in. If you have a taste for the classics, you can spend a  few hours with Van Eyck, Velasquez, Rembrandt, and the like. I think more modern fare than the grand masters of yore would not go unappreciated, but this us definitely a must. ",In the company of masters
"February 9, 2020","The National Gallery is always wonderful to visit as one of London's gems. To be in the company of the various masters and feast one's eyes is a gift, to do so for free is just unreal. The National Gallery requires multiple visits. ",Good exhibition but not my favourite museum in London!
"April 10, 2022"," I love museums but don't come here that often as most of the exhibitions don't appeal to me.  I came today after a while to see the Kehinde Wiley - The Prelude which was very good.  Entrance is free.  This exhibition was very small so you don't need long.  I really enjoyed it.  The only thing is that the museum is super busy on a Saturday afternoon so it was difficult to appreciate the art without bumping into people.  It appeared to be or maybe I got it wrong is that they were managing numbers and I had to book a free timed entrance ticket. This was not checked however so not sure what the point was.  I may have got it wrong as I said but check online.  They will do a security and bag check.  There was a line to enter the museum but it moved really quick.  The museum is well laid out.  Staff were pleasant and friendly.  Entrance and what appeared to be most exhibitions were free but again check online.  Nothing else appealed to me when I glanced around but I would highly recommend Kehinde Wiley - The Prelude (only on for a short time).  I went early April, 2022.",An art lovers paradise
"March 8, 2020",I've been to the National Gallery a few times in my life now and I can honestly say every time I go there is always a new part of it that I discover. If you like art the National Gallery is definitely a place to visit. The collection is huge!,Definitely worth a visit.
"June 21, 2020","This is a fabulous museum. I walked in as soon as they opened and didn't leave until they were closing. There is a wide variety of art from an assortment of artists, styles, eras and subject matter. The staff is professional, friendly and helpful. While there was a lot of other visitors there it did not feel crowded.",Unique Opportunity
"July 12, 2020",Just returned from a lockdown visit to NG. We went to see the Titian exhibition but also visited the equally interesting show about Dutch master Nicolas Maes. But most incredible of all is that you get to see everything with no more than 10-15 people in a room at once. Many rooms are completely empty and you have them entirely for yourself. Grab this amazing opportunity whilst it lasts. ,wonderful
"February 11, 2022","it has always been a must see for for many, many years and the one thing I always do when visiting London. the overly cautious and tiresome entrantance requirements are unfortuneately a sign of the times but once in the joys of centuries of art is there to be seen. although I appreciate 'the blue boy' the turners and monets are where I tend to spend my time",Wear comfortable shoes !
"August 29, 2020","First time visiting but well worth it to see such famous and inspiring works of art.Reubens the Lion Hunt is a very underrated gem.Booking system great as let’s in a set amount of people every 15mins so social distancing easily kept. A lot of walking and standing around looking at wonderful art you can stretch out and almost touch, wear good shoes though.",Back to normal life?
"September 22, 2020",It was so great to be back! London was quiet but that did not spoil our day at the Gallery. Very well organised outside and inside so you feel safe and are allowed to admire the masterpieces the way you used to do. And the Shop was open too!,Covid secure & well planned
"September 3, 2020","I enjoyed an afternoon visiting 'old friend's (paintings) at the National Gallery. Easy to book, well organised and once inside you had enough freedom to wander where you wanted to - just like prior to Lockdown. Of particular interest was the refurbished and newly opened Rausing Gallery - magnificently restored and hung.","Use the loos by the exit, the main entrance toilets don't get cleaned"
"July 25, 2021","I am putting this on here as a warning and piece of advice.Whilst this is a great gallery to visit. I have noticed that if you get cut short, use the loos by the exit/espresso shop. As they seem to be cleaned on a regular basis and are not a mess. I found the toilets by the entrance in a mess and the gents cubicle loos  always blocked and toilet roll everywhere. It's a shame that whilst they keep the rest of the building tidy, they want you to start off with a awful experience, and when you notify staff you just get shouted at saying 'we are busy today.' Awful customer service when I was kindly notifying them and not complaining. Well that's no excuse when you're one of the busiest attractions in London and I am complaining now, if you didn't want to listen to me the first time.Sort your cleaning schedule out, especially with covid around!!!",Fabulous art gallery
"July 16, 2022",Great place to visit and free. I was slightly miffed that I booked tickets online and whilst they were free it was completely unnecessary; you just queue up at the door. The art work is varied and beautifully displayed. It’s easy to access and you can walk through and focus on your particular interest. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable. Gift shops are wonderful and have so many exciting things.,NATIONAL GALLERY
"August 18, 2023","The national gallery has priceless masterpieces. Famous painters like Pablo Picasso, Van Gogh and many more have their works on display here. It is located in Trafalgar Square and can have a queue of up to 2 hours. Prior booking is recommended. Guarantee 2 hours to be able to see everything and the gift shop too.","Large, well presented art collection"
"March 9, 2020","Right in Trafalgar Square, this large art museum has an extensive collection with free admission (donations welcome).  We focused on the impressionist rooms and enjoyed the informational signage on each picture.  We spent a couple of hours, but one could spendf much longer.We saw, and spent time 2 very nice gift shops, and there is also a cafe and restaurant on the premises although there are many, many restaurants in the immediate area.",A Must
"January 14, 2020","A treasure, a joy. Where else can you walk in on a whim and see a stunning collection of paintings by great artists- without paying a cent. In addition, every special exhibition (for which you do have to pay, of course) has been part of my art education. But the permanent collection! Well, the paintings in the galleries have become old friends. We savour them on every visit. The commentary on audio guides is, of course, something you must hear. We love this gallery, so much more manageable and inviting than the unique universe of The Louvre, paradisal as it is. This institution is one reason to stay happy about the world, life, culture. I mean, every visit to London we go. Without fail.",print your tickets warning
"October 12, 2020","Just a word of warning rather than a full review, please make sure you print off your conformation tickets before you arrive. The staff have to scan the QR barcode thingy and I, as well as several others could not get tickets to download on our phones whilst waiting outside (and yes all brands, not just Samsung/iphones etc). The staff where helpful if a little harassed at all the people having the same trouble. Also, it's a good idea to arrive a good 15 mins before your allotted time. If you can't print off the tickets before arriving, like me,  then arrive a good 30 mins before your allotted time.",A young person's perspective of the gallery
"May 17, 2022","As a young person visiting the gallery, I was initially worried about whether it was for me, due to the stigma surrounding art galleries. However, I ended up being pleasantly surprised by just how captivating the art being showcased all over the gallery was to me. I would definately recommend to people of all ages, not just adults as it is far better than what usual art galleries are presented as.",No surprise-great collection!
"February 23, 2020","A great museum with something for every art lover.  If you like Impressionism, the Gallery has a great selection; if you like other periods, they’re equally well represented.  A don’t miss:  The Execution of Lady Jane Gray by Paul Delarouche — superb!",Plenty of information and staff on hand to help
"January 5, 2020",The exhibits here are a hood mix of modern and old. There is a member of staff in every room who can answer questions about the paintings. Each painting has information about it on the wall. The only issue we had was that it is like a rabbit warren and naps on the venue were difficult to find. ,A must see while visiting London
"July 24, 2022",This is a wonderful place to visit while in London. You can spend hours here viewing some of the greatest artists in the world.If you are tight on funds (you can visit for nothing) but if you can please leave 10-pounds. I guarantee you will be amazed by the beautiful art that is here,The quality is declining
"January 28, 2023",Every time I go to National Gallery I gel like the quality of the experience is worse and worse.The art is interesting and you can definitely find artwork to suit your preferences. However the management is terrible. I’m not sure why there is an online booking in place if you have to queue to get in anyway. Also I would imagine the reason to book is to limit the amount of people inside so you have a better experience.  But apparently I imagined wrong. Cafe and restaurant is not in the best shape either. Better have your coffee beforehand.,Leonardo exhibit
"February 1, 2020","Always a pleasure to go there, we heard the curator give a talk about mounting the exhibition. It was interesting but l found that it was difficult to maintain the interest for the whole time. I may not attend future talks of this nature.",Great place. Starting from middle-ages ending in 20th century.
"January 21, 2021",This is a fantastic Art Gallery with fabulous paintings.  They have an exhibition on at the moment showcasing the art of Artemisia Gentileshi an amazing female Baroque painter who was trained by her father.  The colours are sumptuous and the paintings all tell stories.  Well worth a visit.  They also have Titian and other great artists.,Free Masterpieces
"August 1, 2022","I wasn't planning to go to an art museum in London because I didn't have a lot of time, but I walked by the National Gallery and saw that it was FREE. The collection is amazing, and it gave me Stendahl Syndrome. I appreciated that there are several suggested routes with estimated times for each route--so if you're on a tight schedule, you can choose what you want to do. I spent around an hour in the museum, although I was tempted to linger longer. They have DaVinci, Michelangelo, Van Eyck, Impressionists. In every gallery my jaw dropped, and I thought ""THAT is here!?"" I was really excited to see Canaletto's paintings of Venice.  The entrance is free, but I got in trouble in the gift shop.",So much to see and it's free!
"August 1, 2022","We've walked by the National Gallery so many times on previous trips to London and finally visited. The line was very short so we went in. Glad we did. It's filled with so many treasures. The signage gives an estimate on how long it takes to go through each main gallery but maybe only if you speed walk and see the highlights. We ended up spending a lot more time here - maybe 3 hours - and we didn't see it all. Love how you can go from the earliest pieces in the collection to more modern art. You could easily spend a full morning or afternoon exploring the galleries in more detail. There is no entrance fee, like many large London museums, which is absolutely amazing.",Exhibits Five Star
"December 29, 2021","The art is exceptional: no doubt about it. The layout is genius and the building is stunning.The gallery is let down by organisation. You have to get your free ticket before entering. This entailed everyone standing around a QR code on the wall, completing a long form and waiting for their ticket to arrive by email.Then you queue again to enter. Someone waves a torch inside some of your bags and finally you are allowed to enter the gallery.",Enjoyable afternoon
"March 1, 2020","Spent a very enjoyable afternoon, looking at the impressionist art and gift shop at the national gallery. It’s free to visit and we’ll organised. They ask for a voluntary donation, we’ll worth a Visit if you enjoy art.",Breathtaking exhibition of paintings by Artemisia Gentileschi
"December 14, 2020","An astonishing achievement to bring so many paintings by Artemisia Gentileschi together at one time, including some from private collections and others from across the world.  Amongst those I have not come across before was her 1636-7 “Bathsheba bathing“, with David almost invisible away in the background a virtually amorphous dark lump on a balcony: all the colour; all the personality in Bathsheba and her maid servants, and the relationships between them.  The staff were universally welcoming and friendly: not easy with the various requirements to wear face-nappies &cetera: these requirements are not of their making, and even though pointless they have to be enforced.  A fabulous visit.  ",Great in theory
"January 12, 2020","I know this will go against the grain. The National Gallery is free, it is a beautiful building, it is full of famous and less famous paintings of the highest quality from across the centuries. If you are an art historian or budding art historian it must be one of the greatest resources in the world. Sadly I have my fill of messiahs, wistful saints and impenetrable allegory pretty quickly (there's one that's captioned ""this might be an allegory on the pain of love or it may be a picture of a girl"", if they don't know...).There is little here I would have on my wall at home and they are the paintings I can gaze at and enjoy. So from a purely selfish, subjective viewpoint there are galleries that appeal to me far more than this one, hence the rating.Go, enjoy but don't expect to enjoy every room. On top of everything else they do well the dining room is good too.",The gateway to Westminster!
"February 12, 2020","Trafalgar Square is very impressive - it was only 10min from Leicester Square, Covent Garden, Big Ben and Buckingham Palace! There is also the sublime National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery and there are always shows or activities for every occasion including Chinese New Year, Christmas, Hanukkah and even demonstrations where people cry their hearts out on stage below Nelson’s statue.Finally Trafalgar Square is what it’s name says - I personally love that the statue of Nelson is face to face with that of Napoleon in Paris. An old rivalry so close to British politics and heart. And, if I’m not mistaken it is just a few minutes walk away from the famous Savoy hotel! Who’s name comes from the Palais de Savoie which previously stood in its place and was The designated place for French foreign royal emissaries to stay when they came to visit the British Crown before the revolution of 1789. Perfectly located between Westminster and The City.A great visit and must see for any person who wishes to have a feel for what London is about.",For the love of Art.
"March 5, 2020","A rich learning experience. Breathtaking. Art through the ages. Paintings by Old Masters. I particularly visit 'The National Gallery' to see Impressionist and Post Expressionist artists like Degas, Monet, Modigliani and Cezanne and Chagall. I particularly like portraits. I enjoy pottierng in 'The Gallery Shop' and stopping for a spot of cafe lunch or a cup of reviving afternoon tea at 'The Cafe'. A great place to spend a rainy afternoon.",Great for the 1st date
"February 11, 2020","A little bit of culture goes a long way, that's why many a good relationship as started from treading the galleries at the Nat....beautifully designed halls welcome and encourage you to explore its interior. Straight away from outside you are greeted by the smile of the Roman columns across the gallery facaded....but once inside the world of Art is there to show off it's very best from throughout the ages and across the globe. I for one believe it's a natural place for a 1st date, and set within one of the worlds most romantic cities.",lovely gallery

The cafe has good service also and isn't as overpriced as some of the other museum cafes in London.",Jetlagged but awakened by masterpieces
"February 24, 2020","We got into our London lodgings and then took a bus after dinner to see some sights.  We got off right in front of the National Gallery -- and it was open!  I was revitalized by this art, many pieces I remembered from my ""History of Art"" class in college.  Well worth visiting. I used to go to the Smithsonian and Phillips Galleries a lot when I lived in DC. So I'm used to great art but this place is spectacular.","I know what I hate, and I don't hate this."
"March 15, 2020","We had an hour to kill before our train home, so we dropped in here on our way to the station. Entry is free, though they do ask for donations. We went to the rooms that feature mostly 19th century artists, such as Turner, Monet, Cezanne and Van Gogh - some of our favourites. The gallery is laid out in a way that's very easy to navigate and find what you are looking for, and the rooms are presented in a very logical way.

"November 14, 2021",My wife and I visited the National Gallery to visit the Poussin Exhibition but also visited the rest of the Galleries and had a great time we only had to leave to meet our daughter and eat some food. This place is full of so much fantastic art you'll won't have enough time or ability to take it all in! There are a lot of very famous pictures and artists but also a lot of unknown art and artists which are all really really superb. We loved it so much we joined as members so we can go to other exhibitions. If you have time or even just a couple of hours go as it's a must to see so much really great art. The facilities and services are spot on too. Can't think of a negative thing to say about it.,Must see in London
"March 19, 2020","A fantastic trip through the last 600 years of paintings. Really well laid out, easy to get around, and plenty of seats to sit and absorb the art around you. Classics from all the major artists of the times and many more on display. Whilst I prefer more modern art styles like surrealism, cubism and the like, there was still a lot here for me to appreciate. Tip? Start at the oldest painting first and work your way chronologically - you will notice the techniques and styles change over the years",A truly magnificent art gallery.
"March 20, 2023","This may not be one of the world’s largest art galleries but it is definitely ‘up there’ with the best.It is superbly located on a raised level on the north side of Trafalgar Square.All the greats of European painting are featured here; outstanding works can be found in every room.In recent years it has expanded its usual remit of paintings of the European tradition up to around the year 1900 - I’ve been fortunate enough to visit 3 times in recent months and have viewed 3 superb temporary exhibitions; 20-and 21st Century British artist Lucian Freud, 19-and 20th Century American realist Winslow Homer, and 2 masterpieces of JMW Turner on loan from New York City’s Frick Collection.As with other national institutions entry to the permanent collection and certain temporary exhibitions is free, although a charge is made for the major temporary exhibitions.",A great opportunity right now
"July 31, 2020","A positive side effect of the virus control measures is that limited entry means you get to see some amazing works of art with very few other people jostling for position. There were times when we were the only people in the room. A privilege, but also completely free (the optional donation when booking tickets is worth considering).",Gauguin exhibition. Ends Jan 26
"January 15, 2020","The public must be torn - Gauguin's art appeals to modern tastes, Gauguin's personality is anathema to the MeToo movement and modern sensibilities. But his attitude of 'art is me' is thoroughly modern - and is well represented in the exhibition. Highly recommended.","Amazing collection of artwork in a stunning building, well worth seeing."
"June 13, 2022",What a fabulous way to spend an afternoon. It's free to see the main exhibition but you have to pay for the special exhibitions. There's a huge selection of artworks from many famous artists from various historical periods.  The interior of the building is amazing and the galleries are beautiful.  It is a long walk around but there are plenty of seats available. There is a shop and resturants.,National collection of classical art.
"February 14, 2020","This is one of the best collections of classical art in the world containing works by da Vinci, Rubens, Michaelangelo to name a few. There is an extensive pre-Renaissance collection in the Sainsbury wing that is most enlightening. It is a big collection and takes a good day to wander around casually. Enjoy.",Beautiful facility and collection
"March 6, 2022","Enjoyed my brief visit to the National Gallery.  All the masters are represented with works displayed.  If you're particularly into works from the medieval period, you'll find rooms and rooms full, along with later pieces from names you recognize from Michelangelo, Reubens, daVinci, Raphael, and impressionist masters like Monet.  Van Gogh has several works here as well.I spent about 2 hours wandering through.  Serious art lovers will spend all day.  Lots of people inside, but because the facility is so large, it never seemed crowded while I was there.",A must visit place..

"August 6, 2021","The National Gallery has an excellent reputation and is truly a magnificent facility. Experiencing and absorbing everything in these collections will require several trips. It is an impressive building from the outside as well as inside. A visit to this museum is definitely worthwhile. It was a pleasure to talk to the staff and learn more about the paintings. The museum I visited was very interesting. We discovered various painters, seeing different styles of paintings, and reading notes for each painting, which effectively informed us of the paintings concerned. There are several different architectural styles in the rooms.",Great way to spend a few hours
"February 20, 2020","Free to enter, yet full of the most amazing pictures by the worlds most well known artist. My partner was crying with emotion as we sat looking at some of them. Just sit down, look at one area and focus on that area then slowly move out from that spot to take in all the hidden details. Loved it, this country can do some things so well, and art galleries is one of those things. Well worth a visit, and caters for children to, with art sets so they can try their hand at forgery!  ",Excellent Freud exhibition apart from nude paintings of his daughters which made for uncomfortable viewing.
"January 14, 2023",We came to visit the Lucien Freud exhibition which was quite expensive at £24 each. There was a lot to see and it was fascinating. There are a couple of paintings he did of his young daughters naked which made me uncomfortable and I am not sure these should have been shown.,Amazing
"February 18, 2020",This is such a great experience. Just the area around the gallery is so nice to visit - it is touristy but also has the Canada house just right across it. The trafalgar square is also amazing. The gallery itself is awesome as well. There is no cost to visit but you should truly make sure you have time to go through all the floors.,A great free museum
"August 26, 2020",The National Gallery is a great museum with free entry and is a good day out alone or in a group. It has many different wings with thousands of paintings including famous pieces such as the Sunflowers by Van Gogh. Definitely more for renaissance fans though as there is not much modern art.,We are very lucky to have this collection available for us all to enjoy
"August 6, 2021","The Rembrandts are the best, although I do also enjoy some of the Impressionist paintings. Unfortunately, I am not able to visit very often, and on the very day that I visited, one of my favourite paintings had been taken down that morning. (the Vigée Le Brun self portrait)  However, one of the gallery staff directed me to another of her paintings which I hadn't seen before and also to a Gentileschi which he thought I might like, so I would like to thank him for his thoughtfulness and assistance.",Great and Free!
"February 20, 2020","We went early - 10am at opening time and walked straight in. Make sure you go round in room number order, or you could miss half the gallery out.  I went for the Turners and Van Goghs.  So great stand inches away and imagine the brush strokes being applied!  A great cheap way to spend half a day.",Great for a mooch in art environment
"January 30, 2020","This is a great free venue in the heart of London, metres away from the Tube and opening onto Trafalgar Square. It has a very impressive range of artworks and sculptures from all ages. Free entry and a great restaurant. Not cheap but you can sit there for hours and chat to friends,",So Great that one of THE great art galleries in the World is open again..
"May 31, 2021","It wasn't until we were actually inside that we both realised how happy we were. You sometimes dont know how great something is until you cant have it. Please ignore the bad reviews. It's really simple to book on line, then you wait until your time and you are in about 2 minutes. There are three pre set routes and you you can do them all if you want. It's was fun for us to do just one and look at paintings we hadn't noticed before. The cafe and shop are still open and neither are too crowded. And at the end look out for the six candidates for the Trafalgar Square plinth. Make sure you read the blurb as each is fascinating in their own way.Are you a Tourist..absolutely 100% visit here. It's even free! Thank you to the staff BTW. Very helpful and happy.Our tip for first timers? Dont try and see everything. And look at the architecture too",Loved the Raphael Exhibit
"August 12, 2022","In July the museum was overcrowded, many were not wearing masks, groups of students were there adding to the chaos, and it felt a bit overwhelming after pandemic lockdown mentality. That said, the Raphael Exhibition was a once in a lifetime event and I am thankful to have been able to see it. Employees and volunteers were helpful and well informed. It was a bit of a maze to find everything and having seen it all I was feeling as if I had been overloaded with beauty and so saturated I needed time to process it.",Great museum but too few post 1800 works
"November 6, 2021","Very nice museum. But, too much of the exhibited Art is medieval. There’s only so many portraits or religious icons that you can see before losing interest. That said, there are a number of pieces that made our day by Van Gogh, Monet, Gainsborough, Renoir. Just too few comparatively. Signage is not particularly helpful in getting you to the periods that interest you. Lots and lots of unmasked people. You’d think art lovers would be more considerate of others. Since we visited on a Thursday, it wasn’t crowded so we kept our distance.",Three well-designed routes
"October 23, 2020","Of course, you have to book in advance, but that's no problem, as long as your phone shows the booking!.  Be on the safe side - print out the ticket.  The Gallery has managed to lay out quite a few of its holdings in three separate walks, so you can see the periods of art you are particularly interested in.",European Paintings over the centuries at the National Gallery.
"August 21, 2020","This place is a huge sprawling space. Trafalgar Square is always teeming with tourists. So it is really crowded. I happened to be there on a day when the population was scarce. One just gets an idea of how big the place is in the center of the London. There were street artists performing there . A bagpiper was there playing a melancholy tune. The National gallery inside is large with a lot of paintings. And I think one day is not enough to see everything. There is no entry fee. There are small eateries inside. So one can relax and take a break from continuously gazing at the canvases. Th know a little more , read London-Life around the Thames at Papumashi the Nomad.",One of bucket list
"July 28, 2023","Waited 45 mins in a queue  to get in entry free, but paper maps £2 download map  done. Special Exhibition charged if you've booked you go through quick queue.   There  are  all sorts of ways to view the painting, audio, (reception)tour, and self guided. Shops on all floor no eating or drinking in the gallery but only 3 places to go to eat and drink  down stairs and then only if you buy their food and drink. (Expensive)  saw everything  I wanted to see. Went back to base.",Lovely way to spend two hours
"April 3, 2022","This Gallery should be on everyone's bucket list to do in London at some point. The array of art is staggering and the added technology allows additional insight into the works in front of you. There is probably too much to fully enjoy in one helping and given the scale of the collection it is probably better not to rush and miss Sunflowers by Van Gogh, The Blue Boy by Gainsborough and a whole host of famous works by the likes of both British and European artists",Leonardo da Vinci- Virgin of the rocks
"February 10, 2020",Very interesting analysis of the way L da V thought and studied the way light falls on objects. there are many displays and it all leads to his painting of the Virgin of the Rocks. A very well presented exhibition and worth going to if it is still running.,A DO NOT MISS while in London!
"August 29, 2022","This is a MUST SEE while in London, England. Admission is FREE, and this museum is air conditioned (a BIG plus). Tickets are easy to reserve on line, but there were people getting in without Tickets.  Backpacks are allowed, and we brought in a bottle of water.  There are bathrooms,  a gift store and restaurant.  This museum features European Art from the 13th to the 1900 and has paintings by renowned artists such as Monet, Leonardo Da Vinci,  Titian, Vincent van Gogh and Rembrandt. I loved the way the gallery is organized, and the way the exhibits flowed easily. Staff were present, but didn't 'hover' , like they donin some museums. A MAGNIFICENT Museum, in every way",Visit spoiled by bad experience in the gift shop
"June 19, 2023","We had a wonderful time in the Gallery. One of the great things about London and coming to visit in central London are the number of galleries and museums that you can go to, with the vast majority of them being free. The range of paintings and exhibits in the National Gallery are amazing and there are pieces that will appeal to everyone's tastes. You don't have to be an expert to have a view upon art or to appreciate the skills and craft of some of the artists upon display. We booked a morning slot on a Saturday morning (you can queue on the day to get in, but I would advise going online and booking a slot in advance) and we expected it to be busy, and it was. But strangely enough it didn't feel too bad. Normally when you go to museums and galleries or to any popular tourist attractions, you can end up feeling 'rushed' and slightly hemmed in by the crush of people around you, and this is especially true regarding popular exhibits. In the National Gallery, although it's busy, there are always moments where the hurly burly settles, and you find your those moments of peace, to enjoy the works of art. And with plenty of seats (something other galleries and museums could learn from), there are chances to wait things out, and just sit and enjoy the experience. It was all a great day out until we stopped off in a gift shop just as we were leaving the museum. Upon waiting to pay for some gifts a member of staff refused to serve me, instead serving another customer, even though she looked up and saw I was next in line waiting to be served. I was instead served by her colleague, who when I raised the matter apologised, but It unfortunately tarnished what had been up until that point a great day out.",Incredible art collection
"May 17, 2020","An elegant museum housing a very nice collection of over 2,300 paintings. Approximately two-thirds of the pieces were donated by private collectors (likely in exchange for a tax receipt). Wonderful collection, and rated as one of the world's top ten.",Big and busy but still really enjoyable
"September 15, 2023","In spite of being very large and busy I really enjoy the National Gallery. I didn't do a tour, preferring to just wander at my own pace, and spent about 2 and a half hours. I'd last been in 2021 and there were a surprisingly large number of works that weren't on display the last time. I visited during the After Impressionism exhibition which I really enjoyed. I have a National Art Pass, which works out very good value if you're going to visit a number of galleries, and even though the National Gallery is free to get in the temporary exhibitions are often paid entry.",A relaxing visit
"July 13, 2021","This gallery has a comprehensive array of stunning early English and Flemish pictures which we particularly wanted to see as well as fantastic Caravaggios, Rembrandts,Pre-Raphaelite art and so much more. Good social distancing made this a stress free experience. Well stocked shop, too. The only down side, as we came out was the site of the poor cleaners having to sweep up the huge amount of glass around the lawns and shrubs left by the football mob which descended on the square. The guy out front looked crestfallen as they`d also destroyed all the shrubs.",Alot of famous paintings here!
"February 29, 2020","I was finally able to visit this museum on this trip and loved it.  They show cased a Vincent van Gogh gallery, 2 unfinished Michelangelo's and 2 Leonardo da Vinci paintings.  I was blown away!  3 magnificent artist under one roof.  I will prob be back again soon to visit more parts of the gallery!",Completely Breathtaking
"September 8, 2020","The National Gallery is completely amazing. An awesome experience from start to finish.Simple and efficient booking online, well organised queuing system for your allotted entry and friendly and welcoming staff.My visit lasted 3 hours and I can honestly say I enjoyed every minute of it. The building itself is beautifully maintained and the pieces of work... Well, stunning.I felt extremely privileged to be able to view and photograph so many canvases in such a beautiful environment.Absolutely amazing visit. ","Awesome, and free"
"November 19, 2023","TIPS: As with all great museums, do some planning beforehand and decide what it is that you want to see. Then go early before the crowds and, for this gallery, do book - its free and you can book even a few minutes before entry. Booking allows you to go to the front of the queue. Enjoy ! ","Just amazing, must see artwork in the most beautiful setting"
"January 16, 2023","There's a pleasant surprise around every corner at this amazing gallery. I went to see the Lucian Freud, the Turner and the Manet & Eva Gonzales exhibitions all of which were truly brilliant. There's just so much to see that you could spend weeks in there and still not tire of seeing what's available. Lots of instantly recognisable artworks as well those less well known but equally as breath-taking. I turned a corner and found Van Gogh's Sunflowers which was wonderful to see. I ended up buying myself membership and their guide to everything that's on view throughout the galleries so I can make a plan to visit different areas in smaller visits. Can't wait to go back for another visit!",Vast exhibits continue to Improve
"December 16, 2022","We returned to the National Gallery in October and were impressed by the  improvements they continue to make to both the facilities and exhibits.It is also free to visit which is remarkable in pricey London. The only disappointment was their new, upscale restaurant which we found to be cramped and the food quite ordinary. Their adjacent simple restaurant is a better value in our opinion.",Free and wonderful italian masterpieces
"September 1, 2022",Still free. Along the years I noted in several museums (slightly everywhere) different rates for locals and tourists. This incredibile museum is still free - even after the recent past years have had great changes.Always impressed by the amount of italian masterpieces.,Nipping in to the National Gallery.
"January 1, 2020","I was in London attending a funeral and after the reception I past through the National Gallery and thought I would go in. It takes your breath away, so many wonderful paintings! The restaurants are good, the best one being on the ground floor at the Charring Cross Road end of the building. It’s best to book a table if you can, but the self service area is very good, but usually busy. I like the shops in the gallery. My favourite paintings are the Cezanne still life’s, but there is so much to see.",Amazing Exhibits
"February 10, 2020","The National Gallery houses a huge selection of paintings from around the world. There's something for everyone here, no matter how fleeting your interest in art may be. The gallery also has an excellent gift shop with some brilliant things to buy from postcards & notepads to books and t shirts.","Vibrant, delightful, and decorated"
"August 15, 2021","The National Gallery is a beautiful site: not only does it house some delicate and delightful paintings from across the Globe, but it also is a beautiful building in itself. The decor is pleasing and serene, and sets a contemplative ambiance.We visited recently in COVID-19 times. You queue up outside, and very friendly staff guide you to enter and be scanned. Routine bag checks are still conducted. You are advised to book in advance.You climb the stairs, and get to select a route to walk. We only had an hour due to an engagement afterwards, so we took a shorter tour. Rooms have an expert sat in there, awaiting any questions you might have. Paintings have information about them. There are many new additions on loan, so now is a good time to go and explore.The paintings themselves are varied: there are many portraits, landscapes, and different styles of art: from Impressionism to Modernism. I don’t really know a lot about art, but I liked the variety and vibrancy of the pieces.I would definitely come again.",A wonderful visit
"June 27, 2021",The National Gallery offers a huge variety of art with many famous original paintings. Entrance is free though you are able to make a voluntary donation. Pre-booking is essential due to Covid 19 . We loved it.,Premium London Museum
"April 29, 2020","If you're in the region of Piccadilly Circus, the National Gallery is worth a visit. This is quite an extensive museum with loads of exhibits for every taste. You'll view pieces like Sunflowers (Van Gogh), Venus and Mars (Botticelli), and Water Lillies (Monet). Even someone who isn't all that into classic art will see some exciting and recognizable pieces. You could spend all day here!",Stunning collection
"December 19, 2021","It was a wonderful experience to visit the National Gallery and view the amazing collection of paintings. So much to see, it would take a few visits to absorb it all properly. However, we saw all the paintings on our shortlist, apart from Constable's, The Hay Wain which is currently not on display. The admission is free but donations are welcome, there are also some nice shops within the building.",Facsinating
"April 15, 2020",This museum contains one of the largest art collections in the world next to the big museums all over the world. Its Europeanian collections and mainly the English are huge and fascinating. Its entrance is free so you can come again and again....,An example for others to follow.
"October 11, 2020","Post Covid the national gallery has shown others how it should be done. They opened as soon as possible, the cafe is open and all of the exhibitions are open and well worth a visit. Yes you have to pre book but that is u fortunately life at the moment. Where other institutions complain, out reopening in the too difficult pile and get the begging bowl out, the National Gallery has got on with reopening. Well done.","Great collection, but you wonder through it aimlessly"
"February 20, 2022","The collection is impressive and vast, and the spaces are inviting, well lit, with information plaques by each painting and comfy seats. However, while galleries are dedicated to specific artists and schools of art, the order of galleries is nearly random, and the 3 suggested rautes don't provide information beyond a list of artists, let alone thematic or chronological order explained. Since covid, there has been no audio guide, and all you can do is stand very close to the paintings and read, trying to figure out where you are and where to go next. ",Book ahead
"February 18, 2022","We booked on line and entered at opening time. Leaving there was a big queue and this was Friday morning, Saturday morning the queue was even longer.The building inside is worth seeing as well as the art of course. We were fortunate to see the Blue Boy, this was last in the National Gallery 100 years ago.Great cafe, a touch pricy, but it is supporting the gallery and the cakes were very - very good.",Great Gallery...........
"October 26, 2020","We had prebooked our entry to the gallery although it was free to visit. We were unable to enter until our allocated time as it was fairly busy. Gallery staff were very helpful.Although we saw most of what we wanted to see we found the one way system quite restrictive in as much as if you make a wrong turn you can’t go back. Fully understandable in the circumstances. Some paintings ie Sunflowers were out on loan.Recommended but would like to go back when the restrictions are lifted.Could have looked at The Haywain for ages, beautiful.",Not to be missed!
"November 30, 2022","There was no need to line-up, whilst entry was free.  The art on display was excellent and would highly recommend, if you have a few hours to spare.  To do it proper justice, spend the day, taking in this treasury in Trafalgar Square.",Not too much to see but cannot complain as it is free.
"October 18, 2020",Majority of the artwork is Christian themes and not of the works of famous artists but of their portrait work they would have been employed to complete for various unknown people that had requested their services. Some of the artist names promoted are misleading as such as having Michael michaelangelo's name in the signs only to have 1 unfinished piece by him but the museum had a vast collection. The latter stages of the gallery and more interesting works. Mostly cannot complain as it was free.,Impressive Collection of Paintings
"June 14, 2023","Some forty rooms to explore. It has an amazing collection of masterpieces with works from Botticelli, Caravaggio, da Vinci, Michelangelo, Monet, Raphael, Turner, van Gogh and more. The Ambassadors and the Arnolfini Portrait were two classic paintings that I had read about and finally got to see. Reserving a time slot online allowed us to bypass the line on a Saturday. Great art museum.","Wonderful, varied collection of art"
"June 29, 2021","I come to this gallery again and again, as my favourite in London. There is an outstanding array of art displayed beautifully in the architecturally stunning building. For anyone visiting London for just several days this is the gallery I would tell them to visit.",Displays great. Staff attitude sucks!!!
"June 26, 2022","Displays and building amazing. Staff suck!Loved our short time Looking at the amazing displays they have but the staff let the place down. Had a child with us and wanted to use the restrooms on our way out and where refused even though it was only 5.49pm. Even when trying to tell them it wasn’t 5.50pm and all the other bathrooms were already closed, hence why trying to use  the ones at the exit we were still denied. The 2 Staff manning the toilets wanted to do just argue, and say we should have come sooner. Really? I have been trying to take the kids to the bathroom since 5:40pm when the announcement was made when we were in the depths of the C section!!! All on that side where already closed!!!!But attitude changed when we indicated we would write a review, about how staff trust kids!!! Their attitude changed and then begged us to use the restrooms. At this point we declined as why should someone have to argue for a child to use a restroom. National Gallery, sort your staff out. Not only have they given your wonderful institution a bad image, that’s all the kids remember of the day. They couldn’t use the bathrooms. Sad!!In short, if you need to use the bathroom, make it a priority over looking at the wonderful artwork!",Lucian Freud + the classic masterpieces of this museum work wonderfully together!
"November 5, 2022","I have been here many times and I am a fan of this museum - and this time it was extra good for two reasons: it was Friday night, and open till 9 pm, which meant that there were many people there, and many apparently on dates, and discussing the art in a most charming way. The atmosphere was lovely, high spirited, filled with expectations and joy. Also: there was a Lucian Freud exhibition on display - and he was a master of grotesque human portrait (often with a dog). I have not seen this many of his works together before. And it all makes sense, from beginning to end, including a finding of peace with his mother. So my advice is to buy a ticket to the Freud exhibition and be happy. And always see some of the other masterpieces on display. This is best of the best; best from old times.",Durer's Journeys- National Gallery.
"January 30, 2022","This lovely exhibition is well worth a visit. Anyone who is an art lover, especially of renaissance art, will thoroughly enjoy this.There is plenty of information, the works are well and chronologically arranged and the journal extracts are fascinating.The works are well spaced too and the booking system means that the galleries do  not become too crowded.All in all, a very worthwhile and enjoyable  exhibition visit.The espresso bar downstairs serves good coffee too!",Seen/unaeen
"December 15, 2020","Visited the interactive gossaerts adoration sense  unseen exhibition. What a revelation! Please present more paintings in this format. Wow! An intimate way of getting up close to a painting not allowed in normal gallery conditions.  We got in the day before the pre Christmas lockdown but if it’s still there in the new year, definitely recommended! ","I really love this place, it's magicla and free!"
"August 26, 2022","I have been going to National Gallery for many years especially on my yearly walk on New Years Eve.

"November 20, 2021","My wife and I have toured london several times and always seem to miss this gallery. We made it a point to include it on our most recent trip. The museum is laid out nicely, and the works are not too cramped with lots of space provided for those who wish to really lean in and pick a painting apart. Three routes are available, ranging from 25 min to 45 min each. Over all not disappointed, and I would suggest a visit even if you're not particularly an art fan. Our visit didn't have any guided tours (Covid19) but I was told they normaly do them regularly and that is the best way to see the National Gallery. ",Utterly stunning art.
"February 24, 2020","The art that me and my saw was absolutely stunning. Some of the paintings are jaw droppingly beautiful. We spent two hours in there, Entering the building from the right hand side as you look at it from the square outside. Even after two hours it felt like we only scratched the surface.Even if you are not a fan or art this place is free to enter. Honestly one of the best places i have ever visited in London.",National Gallery guided by Anthony matthews
"May 1, 2022","We visited this fantastic museum in April 2022.  Our guide was Anthony Matthews and what an exceptional and informative person.

It has many of the iconic pictures with which we in Western Europe are so familiar, and many more pictures which are arresting in their beauty and skill. Every gallery has something to make you stop and stare and marvel at the artistry that lay behind it. We went to see The Blue Boy and were not disappointed with it- a work of radiant beauty. It is displayed beside other pictures by Gainsborough and Van Dyck to put The Blue Boy into context.

"January 23, 2021","You don't have to be an art lover to love this place. Even if you didn't know anything about art before, after one visit you surely will. Because they have painitings there that can capture and mesmerise even a dumb brain dead person like me so it means it is definitely something.Besides just like many other world class museums in London, it's totally free so you have the right to remain silent and not moan/complain even if it's not your cup of tea.

If you love art, put on comfortable shoes and clothes, charge your phone or camera, and get ready to enjoy a spectacular art collection.

"June 30, 2022",Only had time for a quick visit before going to see the eagles at Hyde Park. Every trip to London I go to view the painting of lady Jane grey being prepared for her execution. It's both beautiful and sad and transfixes you. My girlfriend's favourite Italian artist is canaletto and we spent some time mesmerised by the detail in his paintings of Venice. We will always make a point of visiting when in the capital ,Art for everyone.

"June 1, 2021",My favourite pictures welcome me back but I love discovering new gems as well.  Best is the talks and tours given by knowledgable and enthusiastic art experts.

"November 20, 2022","We got there 10 minutes before opening on a Thursday morning, were entertained for free by animal protesters until the door opened, The 30 to 40 people in front of us in the queue were processed quickly.

"May 15, 2022","The National Gallery is free and that's a big plus. It's a great place to pop into when you are in Trafalgar Square. You don't have to make it a special visit place.  Just wander through a few galleries and get the flavor. The layout is easy. ""Blue Boy"" by Gainsborough is the highlight now for good reason. It was just returned to England after being in a private collection in the U.S. for 100 years. Even if you're not a ""paintings aficionado"" you'll enjoy the gallery Blue Boy is in along with Gainsborough's other portraits.",How wonderful to be back in a gallery!
"September 11, 2021","The paintings are truly amazing. I know it goes without saying but it really is so much better to view them in person than online or in a book, and it's free - we're so lucky in this country to be able to see these without paying - make the most of it! I'd definitely book in advance. Apparently they limit numbers at particularly busy times and it's very easy to do this either using the QR code on the poster outside the gallery, or via their website.",Peaceful and calm - definitely worth a visit
"July 21, 2021","I visited with my daughter Tina (16), who loves art.We arrived at the gallery on a Saturday and there wasn’t too much crowding, relatively calm atmosphere and friendly guides. I really liked the architecture of the place, it was made of rough white stone that held up the roof, clever design.The Van Gogh and Da Vinci exhibitions are amazing, they showcase a portion of the most excellent art in England. Tina really enjoyed photographing them. The rich colours and abstract styles are mind blowing.",Over Officious Staff
"February 24, 2020",Whilst the galley contains the most amazing collection of paintings the staff need to learn to treat all visitors equally.I visited last week with my 11 year old (foster) son.  On two occasions he was admonished by staff for pointing at details on the paintings.  He was NOT touching them.  He witnessed adults doing the same thing and not getting told off.  As a result he did not want to look at any more pictures and sat as far away from them as he could.We left without completing our tour,Beautiful collection

Leonardo, Van Gogh, Van Eyck...this collection has several masterpieces. Spend 1-2 hours seeing the highlights or spend an entire morning or afternoon and see the whole collection.",Great art for free
"March 1, 2020","If you are in London go here so much great art for free and very informative. Some exhibitions are chargeable, but you have the option.Cafes/restaurants offering snacks with drinks to cooked meals for both the hunters and farmers.Adequate seating in each hall/room should you need to take a rest.",A Good Way to Kill Time
"March 4, 2022","It's a free museum that you can spend as little as 30 minutes or as long a few hours inside. The inside of the building has some really amazing marble work, intricate ceilings, as well as some amazing frames. The paintings are nice as well but I enjoyed the other aspects more personally. It's a great escape from the rain and a good way to kill time if you aren't sure what else to do with your day. Plus! there is a really cool view of Big Ben right outside by the statues.",Worth your time
"April 3, 2022","I did a speed-run through this, as it was an impulse to go in, and I had a date with my husband later on to go to, but I spent 40 minutes and got to see all the artists I wanted to see. As a plussize person with back problems, I would love more seating throughout, but I suppose that's a covid or securitymeasure. But don't speed-run it like me - there's so much to see!",There's never been a better time to visit.
"December 3, 2020","Selfishly, have never enjoyed being able to wander the galleries so much since it was almost empty. Their crowd control and routing has been magnificently done. Even the 15 minutes waiting outside in the rain and cold was bearable thanks to the quips and encouragement from their security gentlemen.",Wonderful Museum
"September 26, 2020","First museum visit post lockdown. It was a wonderful experience being in the gallery with very few visitors but I think I prefer normal life with the crowds. This is a magnificent gallery, rooms filled with artistic treasures and save for special exhibitions all free.  If you live in London and love art it is worth becoming  a member.",Very good visit
"December 19, 2022","We had not been to the National  Gallery for many years, so it was firmly on our agenda for this London trip. It lived up to our expectations, well laid out, easy to sit and gaze at wonderful art. Particularly love the Turner's andConstable 's .",Picture Perfect Christmas
"December 18, 2022","I went to the Christmas Show at the Gallery in the theatre.The show is billed as a 'Fun, Festive, musical show for all the family' and it really lived up to it's expectations.I went on my own as I was in London but there were families there with children from about 18 months onwards.It was based on Heinrich Avercamp's famous painting of a frozen lake with people skating and getting into the Christmas spirit.There were lots of singing and music, and a baddie who is  set out to ruin our two heroes Frederick and Maakies day but with the help of woodland creatures they meet along their way it all works out well in the end. I found it enchanting and very easy to watch even as an adult! It wasn't full on Christmas but subtle and suitable for all ages. The theatre is very comfortable and surprisingly bigger than I thought",Vast exhibits continue to Improve
"December 16, 2022","We returned to the National Gallery in October and were impressed by the  improvements they continue to make to both the facilities and exhibits.It is also free to visit which is remarkable in pricey London. The only disappointment was their new, upscale restaurant which we found to be cramped and the food quite ordinary. Their adjacent simple restaurant is a better value in our opinion.",A Stunning Collection of Paintings
"December 15, 2022","The National Gallery in London is one of the best museums in Britain. Home to famous paintings such as the Hay Wain by John Constable, The Fighting Temeraire by J. M. W. Turner, Virgin of the Rocks by Leonardo da Vinci and Vase with Fifteen Sunflower by Vincent van Gogh amongst many more. The Gallery is also marvellously decorative with every room looking really stunning and rich. I spent 2 hours looking around, but I recommend you can spend 3-4 hours looking around taking a more of a detailed look.   There are over 2000 paintings in the National Gallery plus some temporary displays which can sometimes have an entrance fee. While I was there they had a Turner temporary display in which you can view paintings such as Cologne, the Arrival of a Packet-Boat: Evening and Harbour of Dieppe: Changement de Domicile. Overall its a wonderful experience visiting the National Gallery.",The Cafe was marvellous
"December 14, 2022","Excellent coffee and cakes at the National Gallery Cafe and the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, the cafe is a must next time you visit the gallery, can recommend the almond croissants! ",A Mind-Boggling Collection
"December 14, 2022","With its immense collection of artwork and free admission, the National Gallery is easily among the top places to visit in London.  My wife and I have been a couple of times before and we have never been disappointed.  One of the paintings we wanted to see was loaned to another museum, so we will be returning in spring on our next trip to London.  The gift shop also has some very nice, good quality items.",Wowwww
"December 13, 2022","I arrived early (before opening at 10am) and booked my tickets on the spot so that I could join the pre-booked tickets queue which was much shorter. I’m amazed that the admission to the Gallery is free given the expansiveness of the art available on exhibition. I thought that my children (6,3 and 1 years) wouldn’t enjoy the Gallery but I was wrong. They were equally impressed by the artworks and I could see them getting immersed by the experience.",Lucian Freud exhibition
"December 13, 2022","The Lucian Freud exhibition is fairly small but showcases some startling works by the artist.It also illustrates how radically his style and focus evolved.While the National Gallery does not charge admissions, this exhibition does and the price is excessive.",Huge Collection
"December 12, 2022","Wow, the expansiveness of the museum, and it’s free! Save for the special exhibit. A lot of really great artworks here. They cover a wide range of time periods. Big names like Renoir, Cezanne, Peter Paul Rubens, Manet, Michelangelo, Da Vinci. Definitely not to be missed! It was a lot to see, so plan accordingly. There are over 2,000 works here.",PRE BOOKED TICKET SHAMBLES
"December 11, 2022","I had booked tickets for entry to the National Gallery on Saturday 10th December but was told by a member of staff that I must queue like everyone else, it was over 1 hrs wait. I was actually standing next to the sign that said  Pre-Booked tickets and I showed him our tickets but he would not budge or call his Supervisor. Another family group were having the same problem and they were very annoyed, so in the end we all just walked passed him. I felt sorry for the man, as I think he was just following incorrect orders and was not briefed on how the entrance to the Gallery worked.  Staff must be better informed.However, once we got in, we had a lovely time and the National Gallery is fantastic. A must see. All other staff were very nice and Muriel's cafe very good too for a light lunch.",Nice Collection 
"August 14, 2023","Visited on a Monday afternoon with a group of 4 - had no tickets or advanced reservations. Waited in line for about 10 minutes and entered (free entrance). Spent about 80-90 minutes exploring gorgeous art and work from famous artists. Did not get to see the entire gallery as we had to leave, but could've easily spent more time admiring. Restrooms, food, and gift shop on site.",The National Gallery
"March 29, 2023","The National Gallery is an exceptional art museum that showcases an outstanding collection of paintings from various periods and styles. The museum is well-organized, and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. The admission is free, which makes it accessible to everyone. The building is beautiful and well-maintained. The only downside is that it can get quite crowded, which may make it difficult to fully appreciate the artworks. Overall, I would highly recommend visiting the National Gallery.",Well worth a visit
"August 4, 2021","Soooo much to see. As a bit of a philistine when it comes to art (paintings especially), there are a few I know, and many I don't.  Worth a visit, but get a map! The place is a warren of art. Some big names are there (Van Gogh, Canaletto, Van Dyck, Titan, Vermeer etc) most of which I have heard of. For me, the Canaletto's were the best; his depictions of Venice were beautiful and clear.",Please add signs to indicate the way out and put the safety of your visitors first
"October 15, 2023","To be clear, I have rated my experience in the National Gallery as average based on the lack of signs within the Gallery to clearly indicate the way out within a set of rooms and a lack of signs to clearly indicate the exit from the building.  This is not just a matter of convenience for visitors who might be delayed in finding the art that they want to see or who might take more time than they'd like to find the toilets.  This is an important matter of safety for all visitors.  I would strongly encourage adding more signs and taking other steps to improve the safety of visitors to the gallery.",Well worth a Visit
"October 17, 2021","Visiting the gallery is an experience. We aren't particularly arty people but we loved being in this wonderful place with it's beautiful sense of history and past - it's timelessness. Seeing the pictures for real is so very different to seeing them on a screen, we thought it was just lovely. ",Many works
"June 20, 2020","Magnificent pinoteca smaller than the Prado or the Louvre. In a spectacular building in Trafalgar square. From works by the most important European painters such as: Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Rembrandt, Velásquez, Monet, Manet or Vincent van Gogh. I would highlight the Virgin of the rocks and the Sunflowers. Visiting this gallery in London is a must. Free entry all the time.",Amazing building 
"March 8, 2020","Ironically I'm not one for art, but enjoyed seeing some famous works whilst there. However, the building itself is absolutely sensational and a work of art itself. Worth a visit for the architecture alone. Free entry.",Great museum to see artists from Renoir to Picasso
"October 14, 2022","If you are an art lover than you would love this museum.  My husband went to London for our Anniversary.  This museum did not disappoint.  It can be done in 4-6 hours.  You can see any artist from Renoir, Manet, Monet, Picasso to Van Eyck. The rooms were nicely labeled and we were able to see all the art we wanted in limited time we had.  I downloaded an art app to help explain the paintings. The museum said they do not have an audio tour. Really worth a visit.",Gaugin exhibition - brilliant! 
"January 26, 2020",What a brilliant exhibition. So well displayed with so much attention to detail. I learnt a lot of new information about Gaugin and saw some pictures that I'd never seen before. Wish it was on for longer. Finished today. ,National Gallery 17.5.21(1st day of opening!)
"May 17, 2021","Hooray,the museums are open again,I have waited five months to return to this wonderful gallery.In my last review in December 2020,I  vowed that I would not return until everything was back to normal(no 1 way system in place),but the gallery rules and restrictions cant keep me away! I have missed Caneleto.Constable,Monet,Gainsborough and more,its not the same online or you tube.Still got got confused with the 1 way system and nearly missed the main reason for visiting,the stunning Canelettos!This time my husband joined me,we had a wonderful 2 hour visiting,then off to lunch we went, indoors!",Great for art lovers
"June 22, 2022",The national gallery is a good place to go in London for art lovers. There is a wide selection of paintings and something everyone can enjoy including classics by Van Gogh and Picasso. It was great to see some very famous paintings,National treasures
"March 9, 2022",The National Gallery is a must see in London. It's a vast collection of masters combined with changing exhibits. View one masterpiece after another as you go from gallery to gallery. The current exhibit titled The Prelude by Kehinde Wiley is not to be missed. Plan at least a few hours to see even part of the collection.  ,Always the best
"May 5, 2022","NAtiona gallery never fails to impress - so many great memories over the years. The collection of art is one of the best in the world, the staff are very helpful and even the coffee in their local coffee shop is excellent. Keep it up!",A National treasure
"January 28, 2023"," We spent an hour in the National Gallery which is nowhere near enough time to even scratch the surface. However we did get to wonder at some amazing art and it’s quite breath taking to be stood in front of Constable’s The Hey Wain or one of The Sunflowers by Van Gough. We also got to wonder at a Turner Seascape. The free entry is such a boon for visitors, the gift shop is lovely with gifts and souvenirs to suit all pockets so anyone can come away with a keepsake of some description. We’re definitely planning return visits with more time to take more of the exhibits in. Highly recommended.",The building is more interesting than the paintings.
"August 7, 2022","I found the building to be stunning and the rooms spectacular. Overall, the paintings mostly looked the same. What I did enjoy was the student artwork exhibition and the wonderful gentlemen who asked my opinion of the work and had a discussion with me about children and art. He was very enthusiastic.",Amazing art collections 
"April 3, 2023",Amazing first visit to this delightful art gallery. Fascinating artwork and could easily spend hours in there. So many collections and rooms to see. It is free to visit and if you pre-book on their website you can get in a bit quicker. ,A hidden gem - the Ochre Restaurant at the NGA
"August 12, 2022","The National Gallery is one of the great art wonders of the world. Do not miss it, when in London. I am focusing this review on the museum's fine restauarnt,  Ochre, Tucked just beyond the gift shops and one door away from the madness of Leicester Sauare, the Ochre has a limited menu but offers a fine dining experience. I had the pasta bolognese which was outstanding. The service and surroundings are impecable. Treat  yourself to this unique experience - it enhances an already wonderful experience of a museum visit.",Wonderful Museum
"August 18, 2023","Our visit today was the second time we visited here. The first time was in 2015 and a few of the rooms were closed (I think the security staff may have been on strike). As such, I missed seeing two of the paintings I’d hoped to see: Hans Holbein’s “The Ambassadors” and Van Eyck’s “Arnolfini Wedding.” I said then, “next time I’m in London.” That next time was today and I got to see both.This is a great collection here. To just walk in and look at the regular collections, it is free. There are a ton of well known masterpieces.My favorite, though? Camille Pissarro, “Late Afternoon in our Meadow.” That painting appealed to me deeply.Right outside is Trafalgar Square to enjoy. You are also a short (maybe 15 minute walk) from Buckingham Palace and even closer to Parliament.",Exhilarating experience
"August 14, 2023","Brilliant ""Impressionism:Inventing Modern"" exhibition.  The paintings are beautifully hung for maximum effect and, although the galleries were crowded, we had more than sufficient time to view each of them and to make notes. We described the exhibition to each other as being exhilarating. We finished the visit with a coffee and talked over what we had seen.  Our only disappointment was the female toilet facilities which left much to be desired. ",Always worth a visit. Free entrance to all the main galleries.
"August 16, 2021","The National Gallery in the heart of Trafalgar Square is a must see. Charing Cross Station (tube and mainline) is right opposite. The paintings are wide ranging in age and style, there is something for everyone. Special Exhibitions are always and eye opener, many are free.  It's a quick walk from there to the River Thames or to Buckingham Palace or to Leicester Square and Chinatown and also Convent Garden. I believe their restaurant is well rated. I'm not a 'foodie' but if you are on a budget then ITSU is opposite. ",One of the best in the world
"September 13, 2023","If you are a student of art, especially Old Masters painting, there are only two other museums in the world to touch London's National Gallery. So many masterpieces, and I felt they were all hung better this trip than in the past, especially the Venetian paintings (and their collection is second to none in this category.) Breathtaking canvasses from Van Eyck, Holbein, Veronese, Titian, Rembrandt, Van Dyke, and Bronzino. A colossal Stubbs horse on a blank background. Moroni's incomparable tailor. A room full of ravishing Rubenses! Two Vermeers. Great big Turners (I was Turnered out after being at the Tate the day before.)A fun thing to do is spending some time with the Rembrandts and the canvasses formerly known as Rembrandts that were struck off the list and re-attributed. The museum is very clear about the status of each of their works. These were all bought by Kings, Dukes, and Millionaires as Rembrandts many years ago, and frankly, it is very hard to see the distinctions, but it makes for some interesting sleuthing. It might prompt some follow-up reading about the great Rembrandt re-shuffle of about 25 years ago.Also: don't miss the very good Impressionist collection, with a magnificent Van Gogh Cypress painting and a huge late Monet water lily painting to rival those in the Orangerie. Plus a very unusual Renoir painted in two of his different styles!Here's something to look for: The curators have cleverly put massive canvasses featuring horses at the ends of hallways. From one you can see another far off through a few rooms. It's quite fun. Also notice how little attention is paid to the daVinci and Michelangelo paintings. There's so much other good stuff that they simply fit right in. The daVinci drawing is really good (unlike much of his work) and you can get right up close to it.Right in Trafalgar Square! The National Gallery is one of the great places in the world.",Magical
"August 18, 2022","Magical. Wandering through the galleries it seemed that every one had a stunning painting that I'd known all my life.There was a minor problem, finding a way round. Pocket maps are no longer available from the entry desk or bookshop. The small guidebook """"A Quick Visit"" is a great souvenir of a enjoyable visit, but has no gallery map! The staff are very helpful, so we survived. Maybe this is a generation thing. Please don't forget the oldies. Otherwise what a marvellous place.",Do not Miss This Museum.
"August 17, 2022",The museum opens at 10:00AM and is free.  The collection is mostly of paintings and includes Michelangelo's and da Vinci's.  da Vinci's Madonna of the Rocks took my breath away!  The museum is easy to navigate and accommodates those with limited mobility.  There are also many helpful docents to answer questions.  Allow at least 3 hours.,Very impressive - but requires a lot of time if you want to see all.
"July 3, 2023",The place is amazing. Especially since the entry is free.The gallery has so many amazing paintings it's overwhelming.There are so many rooms and paintings that you really need to make time for it all.One can focus only on some of the more famous paintings.,AMAZING!
"December 26, 2021","The museum is free and filled with extremely beautiful artwork.  The guides are helpful and it's easy to maneuver through.  Also, the small coffee cafe has the biggest and tastiest almond croissant I have ever had.",WELL WORTH A VISIT
"September 27, 2022",This is a must visit place for all art lovers.  Entry is free (donations are gratefully accepted) & they have lots of paintings from all the grand masters to enjoy.Their regular exhibitions are also worth keeping an eye out for. ,Winslow Homer is a superb exhibition.
"September 28, 2022","We went for the Winslow Homer exhibition. He is one of the foremost 19th century US artists. We thought the exhibition was superb, with plenty to see and a good variety of his work. The paintings were grouped by subject matter and also by the location. There was plenty of interesting explanation by the curators but some of it was probably a little wide of the mark as the artist didn't like to explain his work at all.",St Francis of Assisi
"August 2, 2023",This is a spacious and well set out exhibition but is largely a collection of religious paintings completed some 300 years after the alleged date of death of St Francis.  There are also clips from more recent movies but hardly any artefacts from near the time of his life - not surprisingly.  It will be mainly of interest to religious experts and also Italians. The power of the story of the life of St Francis is demonstrated by this exhibition.,FREE! No need reservation
"May 3, 2022","What a cool place! FREE Entrance!March 2022 - You don't need to reserve your time to enter the museum, even with no reservation they will let you go in. Amazing art! Don't fancy see everything as the place is gigantic. Impossible to see it all at once. In front of the building there is the Trafalgar Square.",Wonderful gallery with works from outstanding artists
"June 5, 2022","We loved touring the gallery.  Many works of great artists such as Monet, Renoir, Donatello, Gauguin, Michelangelo, Van Gogh, Raphael, etc.  Allow at least a half day for this tour and if possible, a full day.  ",Our day trip in our home town
"January 5, 2022","My middle daughter wanted to visit a museum and we had not been here before. My youngest 9 even enjoyed herself! The place was well organised and staff were friendly and approachable. I would advise booking a ticket beforehand, there is an optional donation but it isn’t that much. A place worth visiting.",Coping well with COVID-19 
"September 7, 2020","I visited to see the Titian and Maes exhibitions, which were both good. Although the Titian was set in the main galleries to provide more space for social distancing, this didn’t detract, though I was out of the exhibition before I realised. There were definitely fewer people and the Gallery was properly enforcing timed entry. And the art is pretty good!",TWO visits in past 4 months!
"July 10, 2022","I saw the Gainsborough Blue boy and the wonderfully done Raphael exhibit in April but did not have the time to see other rooms. Ii just returned from in early July second visit and took in the 3 routes which cover 14,15,16,17 and 18,century masters. Plan to spend at least 6 hours to really absorb the wonderful collections.",Room to move and view
"June 13, 2021","With Covid, you need to make sure that you book your time slot. With this and designated routes that you have to take, it actually means that you aren't getting large groups in a few galleries. People are more spread out and I think you actually have a calmer visit.We had a 9 and 7 year old in our group. Following the green route we saw enough to capture the children's imagination, but I don't think they would have wanted to spend much longer in the gallery. The only disappointment was seeing a disabled gentleman being turned away from the coffee shop as he didn't have a card to pay. He only had cash. I appreciate the difficulty with cash, but remember, not everyone has access to cards.","For art lovers, this is London's most important place to visit"
"October 15, 2022",One of the best things about the National Gallery is that it is free. Not to mention that it is centrally located. So I recommend not trying to see everything in one visit. Go in for an hour or so and enjoy the painting until you've had enough. Then return in a day or two to see some more. And again and again. Why not?,A must see!
"July 6, 2022","The museum has a rich variety of rare historical pieces. Greek, Asian and Islamic and Christina history placed with such elegance. There is something to see for every generation. Not the best place for children. Lots to learn and enjoy. I plan to go back. A must see.",Turner on tour
"January 31, 2023","I have to admit, I could happily have sat in some areas all day. Seeing these paintings in person makes you realise the talent these artists had and shared with the world. I am biased as I adore the works of Turner and for me,  these were the stars of the gallery. Seeing his work in person made me feel many different emotions and for me , that’s what art should be, how it makes you, the individual feel. A free visit, donations are very much a must as you are preserving history for future generations so be generous and pop some donations I. The boxes to ensure we keep these wonderful works safe forever!",Always a Delight to Visit
"April 30, 2022","Whenever I visit London, I most often visit the National Gallery. On this recent visit, I bought the ticket to the Raphael Exhibition. I have to say that it was a bit underwhelming. However, I still enjoyed my visit, large because you can always get a lot out of the permanent collections. Oh, Gainsborough's Blue Boy was a treat!",The best free collection in the world
"September 28, 2023",The National Gallery doesn't need a description. But if you're thinking of going plan your visit as there's too much to see in one hit. Do some research first and focus on particular eras or artists. Personally I love the older works (pre-1500) in the Sainsbury Wing and Spanish religious art. Both are well represented.Also look for the free guided tours and/or the talk and draw sessions on Friday lunchtimes.It is open late on Fridays and best avoided on Sundays as its too busy.,Stunning
"May 20, 2022","A national treasure. Stunning exhibits, no crowds, immediate access without booking (10.00am Wednesday). The 'guided routes' not signposted well enough, it's easy to get off track and miss things.",Muriel’s Expresso Bar
"January 17, 2023","I stopped off at this bar to buy a cup of tea. My sister who was with me wanted a drink of water. This was refused. They were selling small glass bottles of water for £2.80. I was , somewhat reluctantly, directed to a drinking fountain but there were no cups there. My sister and I are independent pensioners and able to manage but I think all bars and cafes should provide drinking water on request. Children and elderly people can easily become dehydrated on a day out in London and charging £2.80 is quite simply a rip off.",Best Art Museum in London
"May 27, 2023","One of the last things we saw on our England trip was the National Gallery.  While I had see both Tate's, this was the best art museum in London with the most diverse collection with the best artist and pieces.  The paintings are masterpieces by the greatest artists, de Vinci, Titian, and Vermeer to Impressionist like Monet, Manet and Renoir and Post Impressionist like Suerat, Cezanne and Van Gogh.  There were even interesting paintings from British history.  All of this it a great building that was decorated for the season.  Again, there are many art museums in London, but this is the best.",Wonderful Experience with the Old Masters
"August 24, 2022","Absolutely loved our visit to the National Gallery! Seeing the Old Masters - Rembrandt, Monet, Manet, Titian - live, up close and personal was a dream come true. We could have spent many more hours in here. It is absolutely a must see destination for any self respecting art enthusiast!",Amazing!
"January 19, 2023","one thing that i love about British Museum is the free entry. I enjoyed walking around the national gallery, a wonderful museum for classic art lovers with famous paintings fro VanGogh, Monet and others. If you have time please go and visit it. ",World class art gallery that is free and accessible to the public
"August 20, 2023","Incredible art gallery that I love and have returned to about once per year for about 10 years (almost every time I am in London from the US).Special shout-out to Alan who works there and made my entire day during a recent visit. Alan is passionate and knowledgeable about art. I was concerned because I could not find my favorite Claude painting (Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba) and Alan not only immediately knew what painting I was describing, but knew where they moved it. He also knew key facts about the work, artist, and reason for where it was moved too. Thank you Alan and National Gallery for another memorable trip - See you soon!",A must-visit for anyone looking to explore the world's greatest art
"February 9, 2023","With over 2,300 paintings from the 13th to 19th centuries, the museum offers a unique insight into the history of art. From Renaissance masterpieces to Impressionist masterpieces, there's something for everyone. It's a great way to experience the best of European art in one place.",Great gallery
"April 15, 2021",Great spot located in Trafalgar Square. We've been to the Gallery many times before although on this occasion we didn't go inside. It looks really  historic on the outside and some of the pieces on the inside are fantastic. Really recommend visiting when in London.,FAMOUS ART
"January 13, 2023",I could spend a whole day in here but due to limited time I only saw maybe 75% of the gallery.  I printed out a map prior to arriving and circled the rooms of which pieces I HAD to see. My favorite was Van Gogh. Be prepared to wait since that's where it's mostly crowded. ,Brilliant... apart from the mobile phones everywhere!
"May 19, 2023","Though the art is exceptional, please, please why do you need to take photos of every single piece! I had a camera shoved in front of my face multiple times around this breathtaking gallery. I’m hopeful the National will start to do something about this problem when viewing art, to actually view it... taking selfies in the corner of the gallery or do your own personal photoshoot is just not what these special places are about!",A wonderful place to visit
"April 26, 2023","We were pleasantly surprised at how many wonderful artists works can be seen here: Degas, Monet, Manet, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Constable, Turner… the list goes on. We spent a few very enjoyable hours wandering round and appreciating this fabulous place. If you’re visiting London it should definitely be on your to do list.",(In)accessible
"December 20, 2022","I’ve been before, and this is of course one of the world’s premier art collections.  But on consecutive days this week, I was faced with long queues to get in.  This never used to be a problem. There was a big entrance right in the middle which now seems to have been closed off, leading to a bottleneck situation. I find it rather ironic that something presumably done in order to improve accessibility has actually made it more inaccessible.",Must in London
"May 1, 2023","Located in the Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery is an excellent art gallery, hosting lots of iconic artworks. In my opinion, it's a must see. The entrance is free, which surprised me when I planned my trip to London.",Super After Impressionism exhibition 
"May 5, 2023",We came here for the After Impressionism exhibition which covered the period from about 1886 until 1914. It is a huge exhibition in 8 rooms and contains many paintings I haven't seen before probably as they are in private collections. We were enthralled and spent 2 hours here. I particularly liked the Van Gogh paintings. I thought the narrative within the rooms was a bit confused though.,Dreadful jobsworth and pointless exercise in time slots when they were not observed anyway.
"October 21, 2021","When looking at website it states walk in tickets available each day, but when arriving  Jobsworth on the door will ask if you have a smart phone, tell him no and he will let you walk in and get a ticket straight away from the desk which yau can then throw in the bin as no one checks it. However if you say yes you can then join the crowd of people outside who are all stood in the rain trying to get the ticket booking to work. The funny thing is, that after going through this pointless exercise you can then mingle with all the maskless people inside. I only found this out about the ticket as we stood outside with other furious and wet people because I happened to hear an old couple say that they had no internet, so we did the same and were ushered straight in.",3 Hours and you are done
"December 19, 2023",Any museum of this scope and magnitude can be a challenge. Museum Fatigue will set in after about three hours of exploration. You'll know that you are ready to leave when you walk by one-of-a-kind / priceless / unique archeological finds and don't even notice them. That is when you decide to come back another day and go have a nice pint somewhere else :) ,A maze of extraordinary works
"July 23, 2023","A beautiful building with some of the worlds most famous paintings. I came for the Van Gogh works, in particular his Sunflowers.The layout of the building is a little confusing; I would have befitted by being given a simple map at the door as quite often I felt like I was in a maze with no middle. There was an amusing children’s gallery near the beginning, where kids from many schools around the country had created works of art based on a real painting. The theme this year was the sea and there were some beautiful and thoughtful pieces which I enjoyed. Overall an enjoyable couple of hours.",Nice relaxing stop
"December 9, 2022",This square is full of great photographic and historical opportunities. The fountain is beautiful and public bathrooms are clean. There were several cafes in the area. There is a free elevated platform in a building not far away which name I do not remember.,So Many Masterpiece’s
"September 28, 2022","This place is huge! We spent at least 3 hours and I don’t think we saw it all. Be sure to take your map with you because it’s like a huge maze. There are so many great works of art by so many famous painters. Van Dyke, Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubins, Gainsborough, Leonardo DaVinci, Botticelli and my personal favorites, the impressionists. Claude Monet, Manet, Renoir, Cezanne, Gaugan, Van Gogh, Picasso just to name a few. If you like famous paintings, do not miss this!!!!",Inspiring art
"July 23, 2021","My wife and I visited to view the Copernicus portrait and the new Bellotto exhibition. These are outstanding and inspiring pictures, beautifully hung and curated. The Gallery is dealing really well with the trials of COVID-19.",A must-visit for anyone interested in art
"April 17, 2023",The knowledgeable staff are friendly and helpful and the free admission is a great bonus. The stunning architecture of the building is a sight to behold and the convenient location is easy to find. It's a great place to spend an afternoon exploring the vast collection of artwork. Highly recommended!,Wonderful museum
"August 17, 2022",This museum was a great place to see beautiful artwork.  It was very large with a lot of rooms.  I highly recommend this amazing museum!,Grand building
"August 17, 2022","Well kept, grand and awe inspiring place. Less tourists and good place to go compared to other crowded attractions",Amazing collection
"August 17, 2022","Brought our 10 year old, who was tired and checked out/must return ~ stunning collection, allow more time than they suggest (at least 3 hours?). ",Do not Miss This Museum.
"August 17, 2022",The museum opens at 10:00AM and is free.  The collection is mostly of paintings and includes Michelangelo's and da Vinci's.  da Vinci's Madonna of the Rocks took my breath away!  The museum is easy to navigate and accommodates those with limited mobility.  There are also many helpful docents to answer questions.  Allow at least 3 hours.,Good
"August 17, 2022","So many great pieces on show, would highly recommend for a family or solo day out. Try to go mid week",Stupendous Rafael exhibition
"August 17, 2022","Rafael exhibition does not need my commendation but I just one to acknowledge the contents which had exceptional portraits - the non ecclastiacal were so real ,with their vivid colours, stared out at youSo I have chosen a few in my humble opinion which stood outWe were also able to view Blue Boy by Thomas Gainsborough on temporary display in a nearby room",Always something to surprise you!
"August 16, 2022","I have been there many times and everytime something touches me differently. Rafael's exhibit is really impressive. And Caravaggio's Emaus Supper my favorite. The restaurant is nice good salads, modern service. good option for a quick stop",Loved it
"August 16, 2022",Loved it. What an amazing collection. So well presented. The building itself is exceptional too. Enjoyed the visit. Spent 2 hours and it wasn’t brought.,"Wonderful pictures, especially the Ambassadors"
"August 15, 2022","Beautifully presented collections, with good explanations of each picture, and enough space to stand back and appreciate the subject.",Hot and busy
"August 13, 2022","Some very famous paintings on view like Sunflowers by Van Gogh, and numerous Canaletto scenes, such detail.  Restaurant prices extortionate though.",Bit of a effort to get in
"August 25, 2021",Went for an afternoon stroll. Bit of a effort to get in. You have to register and then wait for a couple of email which may or may not go to your junk box. The galleries were not to busy and the safe had great customer service ,Always worth the visit
"January 2, 2020","We had some time to explore between adventures and headed to see the Gaugin exhibit... but it wasn’t open yet, so used to time to explore the Gallery proper. Some familiar sights, some new discoveries, even just watch the farces in the crowd...all are treasures.",They let us in with no booking
"June 3, 2021","Great exhibition, amazing staff, lift for pram. Would not miss it if  waking by. Silence, history and great art work from the past,( 13th -20th century) nothing contemporary. ",Ochre restaurant at the National gallery
"April 25, 2022","More chore than ochre!!I went to the above restaurant for lunch on my own after a visit to the gallery.The place was not crowded. I sat at the table for over ten minutes and felt like an invisible diner.No waiter came to give me the menu, or even acknowledged my presence. The table of six next to me having champagne … I realise that eating on your own is quite rare but, I do it a lot all over the world.I eventually had a wonderful lunch at Cicchetti. The Italian waiters were charming. Shows you the difference in culture.",It was great place. Clean. Beautiful.
"July 6, 2022","It was great place. Clean. Beautiful. There were lots of people in there, as aspected. The down side for me was the fact that there was no guide.I know there are tabs on the wall to explain some of the paintings, however, there were some things that had no explanation and there was no one to guide us.Overall, it’s a good place to hangout for the weekend.",A lot to see
"July 31, 2022",A lot to see and you can really enjoy ART. Unfortunately I wasn't alllowed to take pictures with my 360 camera because staff said I cannot raise camera and make pictures. For security reasons or just shovinistic people? ,A feast of fabulous art
"August 10, 2023","Iconic building with vast rooms of wonderful art, so much to see let alone the exhibitions that are chargeable.Excellent little cafe with the best-ever almond croissant, great service and reasonably priced, we refuelled to see more rooms.  So many treasures it is a wondrous experience. We did not have a tour - just wandered at leisure.",Unexpectedly facinating.
"March 30, 2020",Went in to escape the rain. What an amazing place to be able to enter free of charge. It really brings history and it's characters to life. Right up to date with a brilliantly executed portrait of Ed Shearan. Would go again to cover the areas we had no time for.,Great exhibition
"July 26, 2023",Plenty of works from Constable and other artists. Also saw few from van Gogh and Picasso (They were the most crowded). The building itself was pretty too. Booked in advance. Visited 20th of july and it was only mildly crowded.,Lovely experience
"September 22, 2020","Have visited the tItian exhibition twice now. On both occasions social,distancing exemplary, staff are friendly, doing their absolute best. Lovely browse around other rooms too.i was unsure previsit about the route to take but an email was quickly answered with a helpful reply.",Good routes to choose if you stick to them
"October 5, 2021",All free unless you go to a particular event.  There are routes to choose to go past certain artists.  It can be quite difficult to stick to your chosen route as there is so much to see.  Nice shop.,Beautiful Art
"June 12, 2022","The National Gallery is a must visit if you are on London. While art isn’t my thing, I am still glad I went because I was able to see art from some really famous artists. Get tickets in advance even though it’s free!",Overwhelming experience without guidance
"June 11, 2023","Quite overwhelming to be honest. It’s definitely worth a visit, their collection is impressive. Seeing everything is almost impossible, and here comes the only drawback of it that I can see. The staff isn’t helpful enough, for example when I asked how I can get to something I was answered that I didn’t have enough time to get there( it was 30 min to closing). In my opinion it isn’t how you treat a guest. Apart from that great experience, but only if you have a lot of free time. In other case, you have come and try to see at least the highlights.",Always a delight
"January 17, 2020",Always a delight. Free to visit but fee for special exhibition. Special exhibition a bit steep priced. Well worth the time. Excellent selection. None of the time I follow the map and always see something unexpected.,You must stop in if even for an hour!
"August 18, 2023","We came here yesterday with a friend. We stop here for a visit every year while in London. It is free and has wonderful art from many great masters. Easy to walk around and soak in as much as you want! Van Gogh, Monet, Rembrandt, Pissarro and so many more. This is a must see in London!","Huge, so you're probably going to miss some things, but that's why you return"
"April 8, 2022","Love this place - any art lover will give this 5 out of 5.  But I will say, it's really hard to follow.  Some rooms are numbered, some aren't.  We spend close to 3 hours there and I'm sure we missed entire rooms.  Oh well, it was free, and there is just so much to appreciate.  Would honestly go revisit on every future visit to London.",Breathtaking and I am not an Art Fanatic!
"January 14, 2023","Awe inspiring paintings from 800 years ago to 20th Century. Van Gogh Sunflowers made me cry! I saw so many that I recognised from TV, Film, Books. Loved Monet’s Waterlilies too. And it is FREE!",Great rainy day activity
"October 15, 2020","Incredible building. Historic art work. Plenty of room inside so you can avoid the crowds if you want. It is very dark inside, so rainy day is best. It would be a shame to visit on a bright sunny day.",Worth a Visit
"April 10, 2022","Amazing collection of art. There really is A LOT to take in, so make sure that you give yourself enough time. I would suggest booking as well as it can get booked up fully at the moment due to covid. Avoid the cafe, it's very expensive. Even for London.",A Treasure
"March 23, 2020","The National Trust has provided the citizens of the world with free access to a global treasure. The permanent collection here is staggering in its depth and breadth. I can always spend more time than I have available and after numerous visits, I know I still haven't seen it all. ",Art in an Hour
"September 14, 2023","Seven of us visited as we walked through London with a darkening sky.  We only had an hour ... not long enough for this huge gallery.  However, we split up and  each searched their favourites.  The result was a successful visit in a short time.",Many galleries! Many famous works!
"June 26, 2022","Beautiful exhibitions in a beautiful building. Great place to visit, honestly one of the nicest art museums i’ve been to. Great staff and organized and clean rooms. Extensive galleries you won’t get bored.","A little disorienting, but nonetheless an enjoyable visit"
"August 24, 2022","There should be a few more maps around the place, navigating was... challenging. But, we did find Boy and Girl and Cat and Eel, which was the highlight of our visit :)Seriously, some lovely paintings and so interesting. Well worth a visit.",Phenomenal collection even better customer service
"July 3, 2023","The collection is phenomenal but what really makes the visit is the staff. Dave and Maria were incredibly helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. They really made my visit special. All the staff were amazing and so kind. Will visit again.",Wonderful experience viewing beautiful & exquisite art
"November 3, 2018","This Trafalgar Square located art museum specializes in paintings produced between 1250 and 1900, of which it has over 2,300 paintings. Some of the collections are temporary and change with time. Over the past 20 years, this is my third visit, and many of the pieces are new to the National Gallery. The art of many world masters are on display. This is a very impressive collection of paintings and artefacts.",A wonderful collection.
"March 22, 2016","What an impressive building to visit, with beautiful paintings by Rembrandt, Monet, Picasso, Van Gogh, Constable, and you don’t have to pay to get in.  However, because it is free it can get very crowded.We spent an enjoyable couple of hours wandering round and saw a superb collection of the world’s finest works of art.  There must be at least 50 rooms here, all tastefully arranged with beautiful paintings.There is a nice café in the basement where we enjoyed some tea and cakes.I would definitely recommend the National Gallery to anyone visiting London.",A very impressive art gallery and it’s free!
"August 19, 2016","The National Gallery is one of London's best known attractions and is free to the general public. However, they do ask for a £5 donation, which we were more than happy to pay. We had a very enjoyable visit; it is an impressive building with a superb collection of paintings, I was not expecting to see so many beautiful works of art in one place.  There are so many rooms, all displaying wonderful pieces of art.The gallery was not too busy when we visited and there are lifts for the less mobile and mums with pushchairs.There is a gift shop where you can purchase reprints of the paintings on display in a range of sizes and there is also a cafe.The National Gallery is definitely worth a visit, you really are spoilt for choice because there is so much to see and it’s free!",Impresses the fans of art
"July 22, 2019","Central London's main landmark is the Trafalgar Square National Museum, which immediately impresses the fans of art. Renowned works such as Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, Velázquez's Rokeby Venus, Turner's Fighting Temeraire and the Sunflowers of Van Gogh are now home to it. Works are organized in almost chronological order in the gallery. This landmark is linked by bus and underground in London, along with free entry.NIce to visit it.",Incredible! 
"April 11, 2019","It was my first time in this museum and I think that is the only one which show paintings of Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Tiziano, Raffaello, Cezanne, Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Monet and Manet all together! Incredible!",Awesome!
"November 4, 2019","Great and amazing place! A must visit gallery if you like art. Very well curated, it is a wonderful gallery which would take all your day if not more to visit.",Absolutely worth the time and money!
"April 5, 2006","Excellent collections, superbly arranged, easy to navigate, good opening times, reasonable entry cost (donation suggested) and the best restaurant ever.The restaurant is a must if you, like me, have always had trouble finding a decent meal in London without mortgaging the house. If you get a chance, order the afternoon tea, the scones are the most wonderful I've ever eaten anywhere in England. Don't miss this when you're in London.",Don't try to do it all at once!
"August 31, 2004","The National Gallery is fantastic, but if you just walk round you'll be overwhelmed. Before you come, think of an artist or a period you like and use the gallery's website to see what pictures of that artist they have, or what artists represent your favourite period. Then, when you come, you can do that thoroughly.  I go for the Antonello paintings - only 4, all small and easily missed if you just stroll round - but if you look for them, they are stunning, and it must be the same for every artist's work.By the way, down in the bookshop you can get immediate prints-to-order of anything, yes anything in the collection.  Wednesday it's - as I write (Aug.2004) open til 9pm. Oh, and the coffee is fine.",Audio Tours are Great
"March 27, 2004","We visited the National Gallery in March 2004 and greatly enjoyed the experience. By all means, obtain one of the audio tour guides. They are free, but a donation is requested. I gave 10 pounds for four of us and was treated like a visiting tycoon, so you can probably get away with less. Virtually every picture is assigned a number, which you enter into the audio device to hear a minute or two of commentary. It allows you to create your own tour, choosing the works you like. Better than a guided tour, in that you can take in more pictures and you are not part of a large group straining to hear the tour guide and to see the picture. Comically, I found only one picture without commentary. It was an old and quite graphic depiction of Zeus, in the form of a swan, consorting with Leda. I suppose they couldn't think of any thing to say about that one. By the way, entry to the museum is free.",Great museum
"August 3, 2019",The National Gallery is a must visit in London. It has some of the most famous and incredible works of art that have ever been created. It’s centrally located and easy to get to. It’s free admission unless you’d like to donate.  ,A Must for any London Visitor
"February 18, 2006","The National Gallery is a must for any visitor to London - art enthusiast or not. The halls of the National Gallery hold some of the finest (and most recognizable) artistic masterpieces. I visited the gallery on a weekday afternoon and did not find it too crowded. To help my untrained eye I rented the audio guide (provided by voluntary contribution) which was easy to use and provides excellent background information on the 30 highlighted paintings and many others. A free full color map was provided that contained images and directions to the highlights. I was able to view works by Botticelli, Raphael, Michelangelo, Monet, Rembrandt and many many more. My personal favorites were The Virgin of the Rocks (Da Vinci) and Sunflowers (Van Gogh). I also visited works by Vermeer who was the subject of a recent film Girl with a Pearl Earring.",Priceless Art in a Grand Setting!
"April 10, 2004","While I agree with the American visitor from Sunnyvale, CA that the National Gallery does contain lots of second-rate art (and a few ""unfinished pieces""), it also has some of the greatest masterpieces of Western art in its vast collections. I made two visits to the Gallery in early April, and both times it was somewhat crowded (mainly school groups from France). Many of the works from the Low Countries, France, Italy and Britain are masterpieces that art lovers will easily recognize. The Rubens were incredible! Don't plan to see it all in one visit - each of the four wings will take appox. 90 minutes to view! The view from the front steps is also priceless!",Pride of Britain
"December 31, 2013","This public collection contains a breathtaking display of European art covering seven centuries. Entry is free. Look out for Raphael's Madonna of the Pinks, pre-eminent amongst hundred of treasures.",Sensory overload!
"July 19, 2012","There IS such a phenomenon as too much of a good thing.  I didn't really believe that until 1) I was introduced to Strongbow and 2) I visited the National Gallery.  The former gave me a bad head, the latter throbbing piggies.This is easily the most wonderful art museum I have ever been privileged to visit, and I LOVE me some art museums.  (When there is no admission fee, I love them even more.)  My problem  was two-fold:  I cannot decipher museum maps and I didn't MAKE A PLAN.  My interest in Etruscan relics and Cambodian art only goes so far, but I can gaze upon the Impressionists and Old Masters until the cows come home.  After an hour of aimless wandering, I sat down on a bench across from a lovely Vermeer and said to myself, ""Lori12309--what do you want to see?""  That made all the difference, because there is no way in Hades the casual tourist can digest everything in this museum.One thing that really, REALLY twisted my knickers was that visitors were snapping pictures when expressly forbidden to do so.  (I found this to be true all over London.  Flash photography damages paintings.  Full stop.  Knock it off.)I wish I lived in London so I could do a room a day.  This was one of the best cultural experiences I have ever had.",Outstanding collection with excellent audio guide information
"March 5, 2005","Definitely one of the greatest collections of paintings in the world. The audio guides are excellent, there's information for almost every painting. Go early and visit the most popular part  first (1700-1900), thus you can avoid the crowds a bit.",Impressive steps
"August 13, 2019","The National Gallery is an impressive building that occupies one side of Trafalgar Square is looms over the area with its massive steps and if nothing else offers a different vantage point across the square, well worth the climb.",Got to take the audio tour
"September 7, 2012",Pay £3 for the audio tour and you will be amazed by how much you learn. Choose a day when it is quieter - like Mon to Thurs. These paintings are priceless and most of them were donated by individuals to the nation for all of us to enjoy. So pls make this trip.,Gallery Staff Striking
"January 20, 2012","The gallery staff was striking and they closed down the best exhibit containing Van Gogh's Sunflower's painting.  The only reason to go in the first place.  Then, the De Vinci special expo tickets are sold out at 7am.  The only good thing is that it's free.",Excellent.
"November 14, 2008","I went to the National Gallery twice during my ten days in London.  The first visit was to see an exhibit on Renoir's ""Landscapes"" and the second was to see the main collection, specifically the three VerMeer paintings that are on permanent display.As many reviewers have pointed out, admission to the main collection is free and an audio guide is available for a small fee.  If the Renoir exhibit is any example, this museum does a fantastic job of putting these on with a very helpful staff.This is one of the world's premier art museums and should be on any ""three day"" itinerary of London regardless of your interests.",Fantastic art museum
"October 2, 2008","I really enjoyed this art museum as there are so many different works of art from a wide variety of time periods to suit everyone's taste. Many of the works displayed are simply breathtaking and I especially enjoyed the landscapes and portraits. One interesting feature that makes this museum stand out is that they also display unfinished works as well. There really is no excuse to miss the museum as it is free and conveniently located by other landmarks, such as Trafulgar Square. It would be easy to spend a day here, but if you don't have a lot of time, it doesn't hurt to pop in and see a few Picassos before moving on to something else. The gift shop is definitely worth a peek as they have a nice selection of merchandise.",Go on a Wednesday evening
"September 19, 2008",Really nice museum and the best part- it´s free ( because London is sooo expensive ). We went on a Wednesday because normally they close at 6 but on this day they close at nine. There are less people and you can see the square at night. Well worth the time- just wander around or check out your favourite painters. My personal favourite: Renoir´s Umbrellas.,Picture Perfect
"August 20, 2008","The National Gallery in Trafalgar Square is the high point of any visit to London.  If art interests you and you want to see major masterpieces then this gallery is perfect for you.  Unlike other national collections this one is in a purpose built building of many rooms that allows you to study the pictures and not become overwhelmed by the volume on display or the architecture.  The highlights include the Da Vinci's.  The cartoon is astonishing and worthy of 20 minutes observation.  Check out the Titians and Giorgione as well as both Michelangelo attributions.  Enjoy the collection of Gainsboroughs including his portraits of his daughters.  One special feature of the gallery is that if you ask a guard for the location of a work they will talk to you about it, show an interest and make conversation with you.  Thats really rare and the sign of people proud of where they work.  Well done Trafalgar Square on a superb collection and a laudable staff.",Add This Museum To Your Must See List
"May 3, 2008","We went to the National Gallery 03/13/08 and enjoyed every minute of our visit.  The Vanity Fair Portraits Exhibition, 1913-2008 was currently going on.  It goes from 13 Feb-25 May, 2008 and it is worth seeing.  There were great photographs of rock stars, movie stars, royalty, well-known people, that was very interesting.  The other portraits were great too.  We saw oil paintings of the royals, Christopher Wren, George Washington and others that were fascinating.  The website for the gallery is www.npg.org.uk for more information. The tube stop is Leicester Square.I would plan on spending an entire afternoon, possibly day at thegallery.  They have a check -in room for your belongings that looks very well attended and safe to use. We spent part of an afternoon and evening there.  They are opened till 8-9pm on some nights.Don't skip over this museum.","Breathtaking, and all for free!"
"October 25, 2006","Went to the National Gallery for a couple of hours on a Sunday morning, before heading back to the airport, and what a wonderful way to spend those hours! The staff were well-informed and very friendly, and we found the displays beautifully laid out and with lots of room for everyone. The building itself is a delight and so light and airy. What I found absolutely amazing is how close you can actually get to all of the works - it really does take your breath away when you are within a arms length of a masterpiece - and there is something for everyone here.There was a great cafe downstairs, with a mouthwatering array of cakes, along with a large bank of computers, where you could sit with your coffee and peruse the digitally-stored collection of artworks. Kids would enjoy this bit particularly, as it was fun but educational at the same time.There was also a really good shop, with not the usual tourist tat, but some really beautiful art books, as well as postcards, interesting things for kids (kits, books, toys, etc), and copies of the pictures.Altogether it wasn't at all stuffy or formal as I had thought it would be, and it was a really nice way to spend a few hours.","Beautiful museum, huge collection of works"
"March 1, 2020","This museum is itself a beautiful building - and the galleries inside provide a nice home, albeit crowded with visitors, for the artworks housed inside.The collections are expansive, which gives one many options. There are many major works one can choose to seek out, or one can just wander and see what catches your eye. Although I did have a map, I did find the navigation a bit confusing at times - so don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it. Worth a visit - just manage your expectations when it's busy - it can be hard to get space to enjoy the art work sometimes. ",Gauguin
"January 26, 2020",again a lovely exhibition at the National Gallerybooking in advance is recommended but they do have a ticket office for walk-ins - dependent on availability and time slotsthe exhibition has a cost but the rest of the museum is free - the museum encourages donations from visitors,Da Vinci exhibition.
"December 21, 2019","National gallery is truly a national treasure. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend to all.  However, the current da Vinci exhibition does not live up to its marketing blurb. With 4 small rooms displaying metaphorical references or so-called scientific investigations of one (albeit hugely important) painting it negates the value of da Vinci's work rather than promote it.  I wouldn't mind paying £40 fir 2 of us to enter the gallery - so why not do that instead of mis-selling an exhibiton?","It is too much to take in at one go, so go many times!"
"October 24, 2019","If you love European art, this is truly one of the best places in the world to see it.  It can be overwhelming, so I would suggest taking in a room or two at a time.  I return to see my favourite artists, and ever get tired of visiting the Rembrandt room, where it is possible to enjoy two of his self-portraits, one done when he was in his thirties, and one done in old age, that hang almost opposite each other.",Easily Navigable in 2 Hours
"September 12, 2019",We really enjoyed the pace and flow of the galleries here. The art is a great overview of the master of the art world. We really recommend that you scope out what you want to see and focus on that otherwise you could spend hours here. ,Excellent Gallery
"May 15, 2019",Great location and great art. Try to visit early to avoid the crowds. It is free too as are all major museums in London. ,TOP NOTCH!!!!
"February 20, 2019","All I can say is this is the classiest thing you can do...Van Gogh, DaVinci, Renoir and more. You can spend a day inside.Take your time and let it all soak in...gorgeous inside and out. I go on every trip and cannot get enough. i love that they keep it all 'fresh' with new items on loan and other special exhibits. It is FREE but they ask for donations in drop box/wells around the museum. They should charge for what you see...just think, you are 3' away from priceless items...some worth tens of millions of dollars...gives me the chills. It is a beautiful thing to take in...enjoy. My favorite, ALL VAN GOGH! ",Start with the Sainsbury Wing!
"November 27, 2018","The National Gallery is simply breathtaking for such an extensive collection of art through the ages. It's always incredible to see all the art come to life on the canvas in front of you that you've only seen in textbooks before. There isn't much more to say about it other than to say ""Just go! You'll love it!"" Be prepared for crowds and people with no spacial awareness with their cell phone cameras. Mobile technology is the worse thing to happen to art probably ever. The Gallery is free, so you will have to deal with a lot of people who don't care about art and don't care about taking any of the paintings in, but who just want photo documentation that they were there. Just breathe, and everything will be fine.My one big tip would be to enter the gallery through the Sainsbury Wing, which is just to the left of the main building as you are looking at it from Trafalgar Square. It's a little less crowded, and you'll be able to go in chronological order if you start there and move through that wing first before making your way to the main building.",Enjoyable experience
"October 11, 2018",Visiting from the USA and this was a great visit. The gallery is “free” but they push for donations immediately. It was well worth the donation so not a big deal. The gallery had a lot of nice pieces and the audio tour made it much more enjoyable. Very clean facilities and helpful attendants. ,There for a short time but exquisite works
"September 17, 2018",We went to Trafalgar Square and took the opportunity to go to the National Gallery. The few great works we were able to see just gave us an appetite to return when we have more time.,"So many wonderful “everythings” in all areas of world culture,"
"April 30, 2018",Either I write a 400 page dissertation or simply say— Life is not complete without visiting the National Gallery!,"Getting worse, with lots of selfies and happy snappies"
"January 22, 2018","I am giving up on trying this gallery. The art is wonderful but the atmosphere is not one to appreciate any of the masterpieces. Lots of selfies and endless photo snapping , spoil quiet contemplation and meaningful study of some of the finest art in the world. A real shame , it is deeply depressing but no one cares.",Lots to see

"February 27, 2020",The art in this architecturally exquisite building is grouped by era so you can spend the whole day wandering through the galleries or just skip to the era or artist you’re interested in. The museum houses some famous art such as Van Gogh’s Sunflowers and Monet’s Water-Lily Pond but it also has other beautiful paintings such as Van Gogh’s ‘Long Grass with Butterflies’ and Gauguin’s Faa Iheihe.,National Gallery London is a visual treat for art lovers (and it’s free)
"February 17, 2020",The National Gallery is one of the best places to visit in London for art lovers and it doesn’t cost anything to enjoy the visual delights.It’s very crowded over the weekend and whenever it’s raining which is now unknown in London throughout the year :)A fabulous free treat in the heart of London that’s definitely worth adding to your list of best things to do in London.,Leonardo exhibition
"December 28, 2019",Very expensive. £20 each to see 1 painting. Better to save your money and go to Italy. Much better value.,Great place to wander
"December 21, 2019","Great example of what London can offer to the casual tourist.Pop in and browse iconic masterpieces in a fabulous historic   building. Free entry to general areas - particularly enjoyed the Monets, Turners and Pisarros.",awe inspiring collection
"December 20, 2019","Plan on spending an entire morning or afternoon here. get the audio guide, and go on a magnificent tour of some of the most beautiful art in the world. admission is free, but a donation is requested. highlights of the museum are van gogh’s sunflowers, seurat’s bathers, painting by renoir, and the list goes on. the audio guide is the most extensive and detailed i’ve ever had the pleasure of using. we visited in december, so the crowds were small. there’s a coat check, but you may want to keep your coat, as i found the rooms to be quite chilly. when you’ve finished your tour drop off your audio guide and visit the gift shop. there are 3 in the building, and all beautiful! there are also cafes on the premises. we, however, went straight to a nice quiet bar for a drink and an opportunity to discuss all the beautiful things we’d seen.",A must see for anyone visiting London
"December 18, 2019","The National Gallery is like the low-key Louvre of the UK. It's a wonderful building located in central London and holds some of the finest artwork in the world. From Caravaggio to Van Gogh to Goya, all of it is here. Free entry is the cherry on top. Now that I live here, I am in the National Gallery all the time trying to absorb these classic works of art. Definitely recommend!",The Paul Gauguin exhibition is stupendous!
"December 14, 2019","If you admire French impressionists painters you should not miss the Gauguin exhibition!!Lots of portraits, but not only.Absolutely recommended!!",Great mix of old and modern
"December 9, 2019",Great architecture - modern has been stylishly integrated into the overall classic presentation. Amazing collection of paintings,Always a Delight for Lovers of Fine Art
"December 5, 2019","A lover of fine arts who visits London never leaves without making an obligatory pilgrimage to the National Gallery.  One traverses Trafalgar Square with the keen anticipation of once again seeing ‘old friends’ – steadfast and almost always with new revelations to experience.  Most important, unlike the Louvre (where it seems most of the visitors are bent on seeing only the Mona Lisa), at this Gallery one does not ‘jostle’ with mindless tourists and one has the space to really study and appreciate the art on the walls.For us, it was marvellous to again gaze at Hans Holbein’s remarkable painting of Christina of Denmark (a bridal candidate for the widowed Henry VIII) who had reportedly posed for a mere 3 hours for this portrait.  Note her thrillingly expressive hands in front of her stiff mourning gown trimmed with fur.  Note her intelligent face. One wonders how English history might have been if she had become Henry’s wife. (Perhaps Thomas Cromwell would not have lost his head...)Here is Bronzino’s fantastic Allegory with its rosily nude Venus and dimpled Cupid flanked by various figures, either very young and joyful or very old and angry looking.Here is Van Eyck’s painting of a married couple named Arnolfini, the wife heavily pregnant who looks lovingly at her husband, but who is turned away from her and is seemingly blind; one ponders on the small dog and clumsily arranged slippers in the foreground and the mirror in the background.And one is again rather disappointed that Turner’s Fighting Temeraire is not painted on a huge canvas!  But to see first-hand this master’s use of light and colour is an unforgettable experience. Note: a few galleries were being renovated during our visit and this was not noted in the otherwise very useful map, so one had to ask a guard and go through several corridors to see Vermeer’s intimate paintings.",Gallery spectacular
"September 29, 2019","Put simply the National Gallery of London is huge. Allowing yourself plenty of time to take in the remarkable art work that is in every room on every floor. For all you travellers this visit allows you to relax in the quiet inside and enjoy time to reflect. With Free entry enjoy your step back to a time when the great masters worked their magic, remembering no trip to London would be as rewarding without a visit.",Interesting art

"December 12, 2021","We went to see the Constable paintings. Unfortunately 'The Haywain' was not displayed. That said, the rooms with the Turner, Constable and Gainsborough paintings are brilliant. We also loved the impressionists as always.","1st visit for years, what a pleasure"

And the great news is that it’s free. So if you’ve a few hours to kill in central London, then pop in to the NG for a few hours of art culture. It might not be high on your list of things to do, but you might be pleasantly surprised. ",Great visit
"March 26, 2019",The National Gallery and the National Portrait are right next door to each other so make sure you go to the right gallery! We did a quick tour of the gallery (around an hour and a half) and I had looked up ahead of time the pieces I wanted to see. The rooms are laid out by period so you can plan your visit depending on when the works you want to see were completed.,Nice masterpieces on display

"February 19, 2019","I could have spent hours more here, but I still enjoyed it. I got in line before it opened, and once it did, I got in rather quickly. It was crowded, but it got more crowded as the day went on. I loved the building itself; and I loved seeing ""The Monarch of the Glen"". I also loved Stubb's ""Whistlejacket"" (I kept going back to see them both.) I also thought the impressionist paintings were spectacular; especially the special exhibit that I had to pay to get into (it was SO worth it!) The location of the museum is also quite nice-- lots to see around there!",Excellent collection
"February 10, 2019","They’ve got Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Monet and many many more.Their gallery is outstanding! They may not have lots of works but the ones they have are beyond sufficient! Really easy to walk around and can do a full walk of the collection in a couple of hours. ",Must go
"January 24, 2019",Since this is free to enter I would recommend for everyone to go there as there are lots of famous pictures on display here and the building itself is great to see from the inside.,A wonderful collection
"October 19, 2018","I came early for my visit at the National Gallery, and I am happy for that. The museum is well visited and not without reason. The permanent collection is huge and the special Impressionist exhibition was most interesting. Unfortunately it can be difficult to find your way around in the museum, so I reccomend you buy a map.",Be prepared to spend a day or more
"December 23, 2015","We came across the Gallery while walking around Trafalgar Square (it wasn't our destination) and decided to stop in. Admission is free unless you are going to a special exhibit. It is a large but well organized gallery. We looked for and found the impressionist and post impressionist painters and were delighted in not only the works of a number of artists but  the number of works present i.e. about 15 Monet's. Unlike many galleries, picture taking is allowed as long it is one of the museum's own works (if on loan the no pictures due to copyright issues). The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. We asked about works by Da Vinci and were directed to where there were two in another wing. The gallery also has the ability to create a print of a large number of works in various sizes and finishes while you wait. As stated, we wondered in and spent about  2 hours. You can easily spend a day or more in this gallery. ",very inspiring
"December 15, 2015","inspiring and visit for free! Helps to understand English history, literature and art.Friendly staff",Beautiful exhibits and free
"November 2, 2015","There are a number of works that I had seen in books over the years such as Ruben's ""The Birth of Venus,"" and what a treat to see them in person.  This really is a beautiful collection.  Unlike American museums, you can actually get quite close to the work and see details that you would miss from a distance.  We appreciated the unusual display method of grouping works by different artists of the same subject, offering a remarkable opportunity to contrast and compare artworks.  Absolutely worth the visit.",Go when there's a Tour - available daily
"October 25, 2015",There are too many great paintings at the National Gallery. Do join one of their guided tours (free). There are a few tips:1. Try not to check in anything at their cloakrooms - they are super slow and will get you late to the tour.2. The tours meet at the Sainsbury Entrance (not the regular main entrance) you need another 5 minutes to navigate there if you arent familiar with the location because the museum staff does a very good job in getting you navigate the LONG route. (Tip: The Sainsbury Entrance is right across from a building called Canada House)),Historically interesting.
"September 28, 2015",Very nice art gallery at the heart of London. Highly recommended to visit... It is crowded so have to be there early. Lots to see and must take time to absorb.,National Gallery Must See
"September 27, 2015",This is an excellent art gallery particularly the education section for schools. Really enjoyed my visit.,London's Leading Art Museum
"September 24, 2015",Nice thing is that it is free.  You can get overwhelmed by all the artwork.  Might be better to take in the gallery over a few days and see a little each day. Some say it has the best collection of European paintings.  Would highly recommend for anyone visiting London.  The museum is located in Trafalgar Square.  You'll find a number of street musicians in the area.,Worth to visit
"September 13, 2015","Excelent collection and very well showed. Very important: its free, and as London is very expensive, this is very good",Visitors beware -  much of the gallery is closed due to ongoing industrial action
"September 4, 2015","We've just spent several days in London as the culmination of our trip around the UK.  A trip to the NG  was to be one of the highlights.  We wanted to see the great English art,  the Constables,  Gainsborough,  Turners,  as well as others  like the Vermeer,  Van Eyck and Rembrandt paintings. Unfortunately,  we were unable to see any of these as large parts of the NG were closed (with no signs outside the building and very little explanation inside). The remaining staff seemed to have little idea what was happening.  One told me that it might be opened by the following day,  another told me it could take months. As we were staying close,  we dropped in on three days but our target rooms were always closed.  On our final morning,  we were surprised to find the room containing Spanish golden age paintings was open,  so we did see the Rokeby Venus. Just not good enough for a national icon.","Impressive collection, but go early"
"August 28, 2015",I stopped here in the middle of the afternoon and saw some amazing impressionist art.  I left just short of an hour because the crowds were unbearable. If I ever go back to see the rest of the museum I'll go when it first opens in the morning.,"Well, to discuss the National Gallery looks strange"
"June 1, 2015","Well, to discuss National Gallery looks strange as there are museums which are in position to choosr their own public. And yes, it is overcrowded - though better in this relation than Louvre.","Disappointed, not with the art, but with the treatment of staff"
"May 22, 2015","I was very, very, very disappointed on a recent visit to London to see that the National Gallery has sacked a union rep, Candy Udwin, just because she asked for information on the price of the private security company that the director's brought in to replace regular gallery staff. We were all set to go in to see the lovely paintings, as usual, but won't cross a picket line to do so. I hope the director comes to his senses soon and realises that staff deserve as much care as paintings.",Just amazing
"May 21, 2015","The fact that this place is free is just beyond amazing. Fabulously curated collection of great works. I could spend days here. I highly recommend the audio tour, which is a real bargain at GBP4 as of May 2015. They select about 80 representative works in the collection as a recommended route, but the audio guide applies to far more works than that. Take the time to listen to the commentary and really enjoy the art. When we went, the curated selection was in a kind of beta test, and the staff were very happy to hear our feedback of the tour.I've been to Uffizi, the Louvre, Smithsonian, Philadelphia, etc. Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest art museum visits I've had, largely thanks to the audio guide. Best 4 pounds I've ever spent. Parts of the museum were a bit of a zoo (esp. Van Gogh's Sunflowers) when we visited on a Saturday, but it was easy enough to navigate around the crowds and pick another great work to enjoy in relative peace.",Another not to be missed attraction in London
"May 5, 2015","Located in Trafalgar Square, this museum is free of cost and should not be missed.  The National Gallery is adjacent to the National Portrait Gallery, so make a day of it and visit both.  Paintings are grouped according to year.  I particularly enjoyed those of the Impressionist era and beyond.  The National Gallery is a true national treasure for the British people.The museum store contains very nice, well-priced items.  Items concern the artists and portraits of the museum, as well as general London souvenirs.  Consider purchasing your city souvenirs here, instead of elsewhere in the city, to support the efforts of this organization.","""Inventing Impressionism"" "
"April 27, 2015","Travelled from Hull to see the ""Inventing Impressionism"" exhibition.  Fantastic collection of paintings - a real treat. However, the venue is simply not suitable for this kind of exhibition. 9 quite small rooms with barely enough room for the paintings  - and even less room for the number of visitors allowed in at once.  It was impossible to appreciate these wonderful paintings properly among all the shoving and pushing.This was the second time  (after the Da Vinci exhibition) when we felt that the main concern hadn't been the art but to make as much money as possible by squeezing as many visitors in as possible.  In the end, we were in the exhibition for just over half an hour before we got fed up - that's a pound a minute.So all in all, a mixed experience.",Inventing Impressionism overcrowded
"April 17, 2015","We visited the Inventing Impressionism Exhibition on pre-booked timed tickets at 12 noon. The exhibition is fantastic with world famous paintings on display. However, our experience was spoiled by the overcrowding.  There were so many people present that we had to jostle to see the paintings and it was impossible to stand and read the information boards. These paintings are best appreciated from a distance but that too was impossible with people three deep in front of us standing really close to the pictures. At £18 we felt he National Gallery should have been able to a offer a better experience and we asked to speak to some-one about our disappointment. We were totally blocked from doing this by the staff on the information desk who even refused to give us the relevant names or contact details in order to complain. Hence this review being the only way to respond!!!!!",Amazed in 15 minutes

"June 7, 2017","Selected works of Michelangelo and Sebastiano del Piombo are featured in a show at the National Gallery (until June 25, 2017) highlighting their friendship and collaboration. Unfortunately, their twenty-five year friendship ended after a disagreement.There was intense rivalry for commissions among artists in Rome. Raphael was judged a better painter than Michelangelo for work done at the Vatican; this criticism was the impetus for Michelangelo to befriend and collaborate with Sebastiano who was skilled in the use of oil paints and vibrant color.Although this show received average reviews from a few art critics, I recommend seeing it because of the sculptures on display. The monks of the Church of San Vicenzo Martire in Bassano Romano have lent the original version of ""The Risen Christ"" for this exhibition; I knew that this would be the only chance I would ever have to see it. Michelangelo abandoned this work after finding a flaw in the marble; the face, back and right hand were finished by another sculptor. Nearby is a cast of the second version that can be seen in the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome. It was fascinating to compare the two and see the changes that Michelangelo made in the second one.The two portraits painted by Sebastiano that I found especially interesting depict Pope Clement VII (Giulio de'Medici a few years before (1525) and after (1531) the Sack of Rome in 1527. The effect of this devastating event is evident in the change in his appearance.Other highlights include a cast of Michelangelo's ""Pieta"" and a replica of the Borgherini Chapel found in the Church of San Pietro in Montorio, Rome, that Sebastiano painted with partial designs by Michelangelo. After seeing this exhibition, I headed to the galleries and was pleasantly surprised to hear a choir singing sacred music. It was especially moving when I was in the room with the da Vinci paintings. I hope to return again soon.",Extraordinary Collection
"March 15, 2017","The National Gallery is one of the topmost art museum for orthodox painting with more than 2000 paintings of different art eras from the 13th century to the early 20th century. The museum is allocated into 4 zones and each of the zone is devoted to certain centuries. I have visited the galleries few time and here are some great tips to make to visit the National Gallery:1.	Do not miss the Picture of the month.2.	There is a free 60-minute tour by gallery lecturers on gallery's most definitive works and a general overview of the collection.

The street performers outside also added to a great experience.",Fantastically Interesting

"October 30, 2016","The National Gallery is a source of great UK pride - as well it should be.  The great works of art and their presentation are excellent.  Give yourself at least 3/4 of a full day to enjoy this wonder.  Save some time to experience Trafalgar Square just outside the National Gallery.  That is an experience in and of itself.  The Lord Nelson Memorial is spectacular as is the rest of the Square - which is sort of the town square of London.  If you get an early start - you can visit the National Gallery, Trafalgar Square, and maybe even Leicester Square which is not far away all in the same day.",You better Gough!

"March 10, 2015",We love our visits to the National Gallery and this latest one for the fabulous collection of impressionist works and telling of the story of Paul Durand-Ruel  was a winner.

"March 3, 2015","Much to my disappointment, most of my favorite parts were closed due to a strike. I don't question the reasons or legitimacy of the strike, but just doesn't seem right to simply close most of such an important museum, definitely a London highlight.",Spoilt by strike action
"February 25, 2015",Very limited rooms available with most if the best ones closed due to industrial action  - we will go back another day to see everything ,Give yourself at least 4 or 5 hours
"January 26, 2015","For free entry you get a lot! We arrived at 10am sharp as they opened and the queue was down the street. However it soon went down, but by the time we left at 12 noon, it was easily an hours wait. So a=my advice is arrive early and head straight for the 'Blue' area. That's where the dinosaur exhibit is, and that gets very very busy.",Disgruntled Rembrandt
"January 11, 2015",My husband and I went to see the Rembrandt exhibition yesterday (Saturday 10 Jan) and we were disappointed to find that we had to scrabble our way through choc-a-bloc exhibition rooms.  There were far too many people allowed into such small spaces and when you consider that some of Rembrandt's sketches are no more than 10x7 cm it was most annoying not to be able to view them up close and personal due to the crowds gathered around the exhibits.  By the end of my visit I felt that I probably resembled the rather disgruntled looking self portrait of the artist in his latter years and the empty folds of my purse highlighted my impecunious position since forking out £36 viewing fees.,Photo museum
"December 12, 2014",We went to see the Vivian Leigh exhibit. It was in a small rioom but it was nice.   The other exhibits were fine also.  Big stairwell that you have to walk up.  Be prepared to check umbrellas and coated. They do want a tip also,National Gallery - or National Disgrace?
"November 27, 2014","We visited London specifically to catch two exhibitions - the Turner at the Tate Britain, and the late Rembrandt at the NG. After checking that tickets were available on both days, I first booked the Turner, then went back to the NG site for the Rembrandt, intending to visit at 10am (my preferred time). To my shock, the WHOLE of the day was taken up with 'members only' visits apaprt form the last slot of the day (16.00-18.00h), so I was forced to book that.When you book a time slot, you assume that the intention is to limit the numbers in some way to allow for a reasonable viewing experience. Not a bit of it - people poured into the tiny underground gallery, where we were packed in like sardines. It was extremely difficult to enjoy Rembrandt's brilliant paintings in these circumstances (he is, IMO, the best self-portraitist who ever lived - as I discovered on a visit to the NG for an exhibition in 1999, when far fewer people attended - at 10am).In addition, the lighting was a total disaster, with bright reflections coming off many of the works - it proved difficult to find a position to see many works properly, and the crush of bodies didn't exactly help. (I overheard one of the security guards advising some visitors on where to stand to be able to see one work - seems that this young lady, in her lowly position, has more understanding of how to hang paintings than the curator. They should swap jobs, at once!)So - for practically a whole day, three men and a dog were allowed to saunter around the exhibition. Hoi polloi were treated with Olympian contempt, and squashed into a poorly lit hell-hole.",One of the best - and it is free
"November 15, 2014","The collection of paintings here is phenomenal.  If you look at the paintings and read the information, you can see many of them were acquired in the 1800's.  It is amazing what works of art were available at that time and what this museum was able to acquire.  These days, one minor artist's painting sells for millions of dollars.  Visit this art gallery and appreciate the paintings they have - truly incredible!!  Entrance is free, however, special exhibits require a fee.",Rembrandt: Chronicle of a death foretold...
"November 4, 2014","This exhibition of the late works of Rembrandt at the National Gallery in London is a show stopper in every way. It concentrates on work from the 1650s to the master's death in 1669. The self portraits, hovering between life and death, have never been surpassed in western art. They are totally honest, chillingly executed and yet filled with acute psychological insight. You can see Caravaggio and Lucien Freud in these works.  This is the ""wow factor"" of genius.  Words fail and fall pathetically away in the face of such truth. Even the crowds you get at the start of any exhibition are not a nuisance but seem to be there as a celebration of genius. Brilliantly curated  the exhibition ""Rembrandt The Late Works"" continues until January 18th 2015. Be there!",Greedy selling of rembrandt tickets
"November 1, 2014","Totally impossible to get near the paintings so crowded it was a horrible experience.  Not worth the money!  We bought a 1pm timed ticket weeks in advance and still had to queue to get even into the first room.  Greedy selling of tickets meant a thoroughly unpleasant visit.  The security people in the rooms looked very stressed, there were way  too many people in a very confined dark space. Don't go. ",Great gallery but.......
"October 13, 2014","Heard great things about the National Gallery, one of the world`s great art institutions. The collection is breathtaking but at times it felt more like a theme park. In almost every room it was hard to enjoy the paintings without the intrusion of clicking and whirring from cameras. Some visitors appeared more intent on photographing than looking at the real thing and some were just incredibly rude in the way they dominated some pictures,eg the `Sunflowers`. We spoke to a staff member who said that photography has only just been allowed. I wish I`d visited two months ago!",Absolutely fantastic...
"October 13, 2014","The National Gallery, located on Trafalgar Square, London, is one of the best art galleries in the world.  The displays are absolutely fantastic.  My favourites are the Van Gogh paintings.  Well worth a visit.  Highly recommended.",Bit crowded
"October 6, 2014",It's got some lovely pieces of artwork but if they could even out the amount of people in each room so that not everyone's crowded against one picture it would be good. , Disappointed
"October 1, 2014","My first time in London I went to the National Gallery twice. I love art and I loved the atmosphere the gallery had.  No lines, no loud people. It was a haven for art lovers. The gallery has my favorite paintings in the world, must sees for any art lover.  However I am in no rush to go back after my last experience. Recently the gallery decided to stop enforcing the ""no camera rule"" and my heart is broken.  The gallery now resembles the louvre with obnoxious crowds flashing thier cameras and phones, blocking the paintings. It was a disappointment all around. I would still suggest you go but try to go at a less busy time. ",FANTASTIC
"September 20, 2014","Whether looking for contemporary artists or the classics, The National Gallery has it all.  We loved portraits of women and men of cinema and stage, music icons, and royalty.....as well as Renoir's and so forth.  Wonderful way to spend the day.  Enjoyed the delicious fare in the elegant cafe before leaving.",Masterpieces you are familiar with - up close!
"September 14, 2014","A free, excellent, well- laid out museum where you will come upon masterpieces you've seen all your life in books and movies. Even peaceful when lots of people are there, you can spend all day or hit some of the highlights in an hour or so.",National Gallery OK but not as good as usual!
"June 24, 2014","Veronese exhibition pretty good.  ""Free Guided Tour"" was a bit disappointing - too self consciously jokey and unsympathetic to anyone who wasn't able to speed along behind him.",Rude staff
"March 16, 2014","What should be a national treasure seems to be completely ruined by arrogant 'jobsworth' type staff who far from welcoming visitors prefer to be obnoxious.  If I spoke to and treated my clients the way these people treat the public, I would surely not still have a job,","Prestigious collection, beautiful building, enjoyable afternoon"
"August 31, 2013","There are so many wonderful museums in London - and this is a favorite.  With over 2300 historically significant paintings on display, the National Gallery could well feel overwhelming - but instead is a beautiful museum, well designed, and easy to enjoy.That having been said, it is a large museum and a huge collection - so a bit of planning is helpful.  The website, nationalgallery.org.uk, is extremely helpful.  One of the sections on the website is titled ""Plan Your Visit"".  In this section, you will find ""Ten Reasons to Visit"", ""30 Must See Paintings"", and ""Latest Acquisitions"" - which highlights 2013 acquired paintings.  Additionally, the brochures at the museum provide similar information and include gallery room numbers - making the paintings easy to find.  While I do have favorite artists and periods - I always, in any museum, want to know what they consider to be their most important paintings and I like see what they have considered important enough to recently acquire.  There are artists here that aren't often seen - including Caravaggio, as well as artists whose work is more well known - Monet. Van Gogh, Renoir, and Michelangelo.  It is a special place and you feel that from the moment you walk up the steps to the entrance portico and enter the magnificent building.As is the case with many museums, the café at the National Gallery could be improved.  Food options are limited, service is extremely slow and cumbersome, and there is little seating for such a large museum.  If you'd like a relaxing break during your visit, the café will not provide that.  Then, again, you're there to see a museum and not to eat - but the National Gallery might follow the lead of many other museums that are upgrading dining options and give some attention to the café.Whether you have one hour or five hours, any time at the National Gallery is time well spent.",The Louvre might be the Best but this is a very close 2nd
"July 28, 2013",You can only manage 2 or 3 rooms at a session. Sometimes there are too many people. Sometimes it is too overwhelming. But is is always superb. Loved the Monets in Room 43 this time.,Museum attendants aggressive - ok experience.
"June 8, 2013","At the beginning, we bought headphones for the tour. We were NOT told that we weren't allowed to take photos nor did we see any signs saying so - we honestly didn't know. While I was listening to the tour in my headphones, I couldn't hear that one of the attendants/security guards was telling me not to take pictures. He aggressively approached me and grabbed my upper arm VERY hard. It hurt for the rest of the day. He was extremely rude and unkind. I'm a very petite woman and the security guard hurt me unnecessarily - he could've just tapped on my shoulder. I ended up in the washroom crying and it ruined my experience entirely. The museum itself was nice - however, for a person that doesn't know a whole lot about hart, the only artist I knew of in the place was Monet. Interesting headphone tour, I recommend getting it. The staff needs to treat its customers much better. Disappointed.",What would Leanardo say.........................
"January 22, 2012","## Note this review is for the temporary Leanoardo Da Vinci exhibition currently running and not the National Gallery itself ##We purchased our tickets way back in Nov 11 and waited patiently for today to arrive. Our alloted time was 5pm, so we joined the queue shortly before and walked to the gallery entrance. Immediately there was a queue of people lining up, so being British we joined it and waited... and waited...... We chose not to use the audio commentary as this resulted in the queue moving at the same pace as an asthmatic ant with heavy shopping.  The crowds were ridiculous! It was almost impossible to move around, let alone see the paintings clearly. I received 2 or 3 elbows in the ribs and that was just from some little old ladies. Some of the drawings by Da Vinci are very feint and small so they are quite difficult to see even close up, but in a darkened room with crowds of people around you its even harder. We read on the website that the NG were allowing 180 people in every 30 mins, I would say to make this even remotely enjoyable experience this number should be reduced to around 75. Yes, I know they need to make money and that the rest of the museum is free but we paid £16.00 and only stayed for about 45 minutes due to hardly being able to see anything and also that there seemed to be no air conditioning of any kind so it was extremely hot and stuffy (and its only January!)Of the 93 exhibits, 30 of them are not actually by Da Vinci himself. they are by his friends, associates and pupils. It is a shame that the NG has chosen to exhibit these incredible paintings and drawings in such a poor way, they do no justice to Da Vinci at all.I always consider visiting an art gallery should be a relaxing experience where you can take your own time to sit in peace and quiet and view each picture to appreciate it. Todays visit had more in common with being at Camden Market.All in all a very disappointing experience",Truly a once in a lifetime experience.
"January 10, 2012","Visited the National Gallery on 28th December, spending the afternoon there while waiting for our timed ticket for the Da Vinci exhibition.  The galleries are extensive and we had sore feet by the time we made it down to the exhibition, despite only seeing a fraction of what was on display.The Da Vinci exhibition was amazing.  The audio guide was the best £3.50 I've spent in a long time.  The paintings were awesome and seeing them collected together was even better than I expected.  The rooms were extremely crowded but somehow, we managed to see it all. The most surprising thing for me was how fabulous all the sketches were.  I was glad I'd taken my glasses as they were so intricate and detailed. And I had no idea the Queen owned so many of them.The only disappointing aspect was that there was no information telling us that the exhibition film was open to everyone and we could have seen it earlier in the afternoon.  As it was we took so long going round the exhibition that we hadn't left enough time for it and sadly, missed it altogether.  Since we'd travelled down from Scotland specifically for the exhibition, we are hardly likely to get the chance to see it before it ends. If you get the chance, don't miss this - it is an amazing, unique experience.",Fantabulous
"June 17, 2021",Don't miss it. One day is not enough to take it all in. But don't miss it. Tripadvisor won't let me use al capitals but this museum deserves them.,You'll probably need to visit 7 days in the week to view everything
"June 15, 2021",I would suggest researching what is available to view prior to visiting because there is so much loveliness to see here that's it's impossinle to take it all in within a few hours.,Room to move and view
"June 13, 2021","With Covid, you need to make sure that you book your time slot. With this and designated routes that you have to take, it actually means that you aren't getting large groups in a few galleries. People are more spread out and I think you actually have a calmer visit.We had a 9 and 7 year old in our group. Following the green route we saw enough to capture the children's imagination, but I don't think they would have wanted to spend much longer in the gallery. The only disappointment was seeing a disabled gentleman being turned away from the coffee shop as he didn't have a card to pay. He only had cash. I appreciate the difficulty with cash, but remember, not everyone has access to cards.",Delightful afternoon at the super gallery
"June 13, 2021",Amazing selection of art and wonderful building. Couple of hours under the spell of so many painters.,National Gallery of art
"June 12, 2021",We went to Trafalgar Square where we decided to visit the gallery. The works inside are amazing and we definitely came out of it with a greater appreciation for art.,Beautiful gallery
"June 8, 2021","This is a must-see every time I’m in London. What a wonderful gallery, beautifully set up and with a good selection of art pieces spanning the centuries. You could easily spend a whole day just walking the halls although 3hours should do it for the casual visitor.Recently, I’ve been especially impressed by the COVID measures put in place: limited entry for bookings only, one-way walkways (that are actually monitored and enforced!) as well as required masks in all areas. Due to the slow drop-in of people it’s possible to enjoy the art more and feel like you have space around you. I felt very safe the whole time.",Great and well organised
"June 5, 2021",Good social distancing. Lots of space. Although the shop at the was very busy everyone milling around in there.,They let us in with no booking
"June 3, 2021","Great exhibition, amazing staff, lift for pram. Would not miss it if  waking by. Silence, history and great art work from the past,( 13th -20th century) nothing contemporary. ",Interest

"June 2, 2021",Wonderful place to walk around. Great pieces of art. Fantastic app which you can download and scan the pictures to learn even more. You can also save your favourites which is useful if you want to look back and maybe purchase some prints. ,Accessible Art
"October 29, 2020","Only thing stopping it being a '5' was the slightly chaotic queuing system outside in the rain. Once inside, everything was really good. The vastness of the galleries plus making pre-booking compulsory means everyone is nicely spaced out (distance-wise !) and so very Covid regs compliant. You can follow a variety of trails keeping to one-way flows. Plenty of staff available to guide. And then there's the awesome paintings themselves - so many great works - Monet, Constable, Turner etc. And it's free.The 'Sin' Exhibition was a little limp and over-priced coffees",Great visit.
"October 27, 2020",Beautiful building housing some of the worlds most famous paintings. A must if you are in Trafalgar Square. ,Nice

"September 21, 2020",Went with my partner after we booked tickets online. The whole experience was very well organized  with plenty of staff to guide us through the gallery. Its a fantastic place to visit and we spend 3 hours  looking at the artwork. Felt very safe re covid and will recommend happily. Thank you!,Absolute must for art lovers.

"August 6, 2020","National Gallery- an inspiring visit to Titian exhibition and more763243177The gallery has just reopened after the Covid19 lockdown. We were lucky to be there early on and booked to see the Titian Exhibition. Getting tickets means using their website- worked well for us. Be sure to turn up in good time however done come too early either.The gallery has good measures in place to cope with Covid19The Titian exhibitions had been affected by the lockdown. Fascinating to see these famous paintings painted over several years-and transported across Europe in the 16th century. No HGV lorries in those days!Worth looking for the National Gallery You tube video before you go as it explains so much more about the paintings.Then onto the main galleries and there are various routes to follow.I was particularly struck by 2 - The view of Delft after the explosion of 1654 and the Long Road. It served to remind me that disasters of all types have happened over the centuries. Also if life feels like we are all following a long road into the distance then for those who walked or rode a horse or donkey then lockdown was a real thingTheir shop is open. The cafe was open for takeaways only when we visitedFinally enjoy Trafalgar Square nearby - it is generally very crowded but for us the lack of crowds, clean air and clear skies was part of the experience",You realise how amazing the collection is when you haven't been allowed to see it
"July 26, 2020","You don't appreciate what you have until you don't have it any more.  Well done therefore to the National Gallery to opening up in a sensitive way and allowing us to enjoy their great treasures again. Our visit started with the exhibition 'Titian: Love, Desire, Death' which opened earlier in the year and than almost immediately closed because of the lockdown. In 1551, Prince Philip of Spain (the future King Phillip II) commissioned Titian to produce a series of paintings showing classical myths mostly from Ovid's 'Metamorphoses'.All six paintings, which are now spread across the world, were reunited in the National Gallery just before lockdown and have been here waiting for visitors to return.  I bet Titian never thought that the people viewing his paintings would all be wearing facemasks.....From there you exit into a room which highlights the quality of the National Gallery's own collection of Titians, alongside other artists such as Michelangelo, Parmigianio and Sabastiono del Piombo.The Gallery now has three routes for visitors to follow. Ours took us through the newly-refurbished Gallery 32 with its dazzling colour and lighting scheme past many familiar friends.  It did however make the adjacent rooms look a little dowdy.  An enjoyable visit, ending with the shop where we bought a face mask with Van Gogh's Sunflowers - one of this year's fashion accessories.... masks are going to be with us for a while.",Lots to see even if not all is open
"July 18, 2020",We came to see the Titian exhibition which is momentous as the paintings in it have not been together for some 500 years but it only takes 30 minutes to see so we spent another 90 minutes walking around the galleries. We were told 50 percent is open but that is still plenty.,Interesting 
"July 14, 2020",One of the best art galleries I’ve ever been to-really interesting array of paintings sculptures and artwork. Interesting for everyone as they are so so many rooms and many different artists included.,Cool from the outside

"December 23, 2020","My second time visiting the National Gallery was very different to my first visit back in 2014, with the lack of other visitors being the biggest difference. I had booked a ticket to see the General /free entry galleries on a day off work a few hours before the UK Government announced another COVID-19 lockdown happening by the end of the day. Trafalgar Square was empty of people (and pigeons) - it was almost shocking. My ticket for the gallery was for 10.30AM and I almost had the gallery to myself. I was allowed into the gallery straight away after my ticket was scanned. Masks were mandatory, all backpacks were worn at the front and everyone was required to sanitise their hands. The gallery floor is marked with one way markers, and all museum staff made a point of redirecting people who went the wrong way. The shop and the cafe were still open to visitors. I had initially hoped to visit the special exhibitions another day, but I guess that will have to wait until the gallery is allowed to open again. Never in my life did I think I’d be able to stand in any of the rooms in the National Gallery and take a clear picture with less than 10 people in it. I was able to stand in front of super popular paintings from Monet, Van Gogh, Degas for ages…I stood in front of the massive horse picture by George Stubbs of Whistlejacket and was able to move back and forwards as I pleased to examine the painting. The COVID-19  outbreak has devastated London tourism, but the significant lack of people meant my trip to the Gallery was incredibly nice - not to be jostled by other visitors, and a very calm and peaceful experience.",A bit of culture!
"December 5, 2020",Saw the Artimesia exhibit and Sun. Both excellently curated. Artemisia was very moving and such an evocative exhibition.,Titian's poesie...absolutely exquisite
"November 22, 2020","With COVID-19 restrictions in place, we were able to visit the stunning Titan Love, Desire, and Death exhibition without the crowds. Whilst this was our main reason for visiting, the rest of gallery houses some incredible works from other renowned artists which are well laid out and a feast for any art loving folks.",Rubens.........

"February 16, 2020",If you are a lover of art then this is a place you can loose yourself in but if you are not sure what constitues art (like me) then it mat not be up your alley.,Most disappointing Michaelangelo exhibition- rip off
"February 13, 2020","Too much simplistic bunf, and not enough deep communication about context and technique. The weird opening room setting geographic context simply didnt work. Why should Trustees spend more than a million pounds to 3rd parties for a so-called interactive exhibit that is so second rate?",A GOOD PLACE TO POP IN AND OUT OF

"February 10, 2020","So amazing to see some amazing artwork from world known artists. Even the children were amazed. The younger children didn’t enjoy it so much, so probably not recommend for them ",First museum to visit in London.
"February 3, 2020","Great place and great treasure of arts! Unlike other cities, London is putting art collections to such a separated museum where is a must to visit just after British Museum, or even before that. Plan for at least a whole day for that! ",Priceless

"November 9, 2019","After visiting Paris, it was nice that some of the London attractions were FREE. Cant beat that. They do ask for a donation. So not as free as I thought. Its located on Trafalgar square which is a very happening place. At the time we went, there was some sort of Arab protest. It must be a place to do such things. Art was nice and varied in interest. Rooms were labeled numerically which made it nice to go from room to room without getting lost.",Another memorable visit
"November 8, 2019","One of my all time favorite museums--the collection is phenomenal & curated beautifully.  I'm particularly interested in pre/post-renaissance, mannerism & Venetian art--the National Gallery has so many fabulous masterpieces.

Of course, we found other beautiful works not on the list but the list kept us going forward!",Another inspiring visit to National Gallery
"November 6, 2019","We have visited National Gallery on one of our Sunday day out in Lonion and it was a very inspiring visit. We have attended Spanish painter Sorolla exhibition and it was very interesting. We later had lunch in the cafe and it offers great coffees and nice voice of cakes, snacks and hot meals",Superb
"November 6, 2019",Amazing display from every famous or other artists on view. Very tiring but worth it. A little confusing getting orientated to see most things however the staff were very knowledgeable in helping you out. Highly recommended. ,A must visit gallery
"November 6, 2019","A great place to see fine portraits, paintings and there is always extra expositions available. It's free of charge. A lovely well worthy way of spending few hours if you are by Trafalgar Square.",One of the world's great art museums
"November 5, 2019","There are few museums that can rank with the National Gallery for the width and quality of collection.  Rooms dedicated to artists, and the greatest of their kind.  And unlike the British Museum, it is approachable and manageable on a single visit.  If you like art, you must go.  Eat in the restaraunt if you have the time; it's better than scrambling outside for a place for lunch.",Fine Portraits and paintings
"November 5, 2019",If you are at Trafalgar Square then you should not miss this National Gallery. It is free of charge and collection is really beautiful.,Super
"November 18, 2019",It’s definitly worth to see. Planty of great and known paintings. All very well organised. Free entrance.,A must see
"November 18, 2019",Excellent exhibition. Very friendly and helpful staff who explained when necessary. We would difinately go again. ,Pop-in it’s free. 
"November 14, 2019","Only takes 15 minutes, each time I pass. This time I took the kids and they recognised loads of scribbles and splashes. However they were keen to spend all of my money in the fantastic gift shop. Great haven from the West End crowds. ",Evening with art
"November 14, 2019",This is a wonderful art museum with many priceless pieces. Their late hours on Friday helped us fill the evening with a meaningful visit.  And admission is free!,Obscenely Expensive Cafe
"November 14, 2019","This is not a review of the gallery, which is spectacular. The cafe on the other hand...Paid £4.80 for a SMALL coke, not even a regular sized glass bottle. I ended up paying £6 overall, also buying a bag of popcorn, which was more appropriately priced. £5 for less than a glass of coke?? Ridiculous.",If you're into paintings...
"November 13, 2019","It has beautiful artwork and some not as popular but still famous paintings that are worth seeing, despite being a free entry it wasn't as crowded as we expected. We could move around freely without bumping into people. All in all a good experience",Nice Galleries
"November 12, 2019","The museum was free to enter but they do ask for a donation. Which is pretty standard for many museums. The art work is displayed beautifully. Being able to see works from Monet, Van Gogh, Dagah, and many others was so exciting. They cafe was also very nice and affordable. ","Perfect place to relax, expand your horizons and maybe learn a little about life."
"November 11, 2019","I had some spare time in London and chose to spend it here. I chose to look at the free part of the Gallery and it was a real experience. It was not too crowded and you could just sit and look a particular painting for as long as you wanted. I was quite tired, not in a hurry and that visit will be repeated.","Leonardo exhibition poor, all padding and little substance"
"November 11, 2019","We have previously enjoyed visiting the National Gallery on our trips to London, but the Leonardo exhibition is poor, its all padding and little substance. Very disappointing.",So Many Paintings!
"November 10, 2019","Again this museum has so many famous paintings and artists it is not to be missed.  Be ready to dodge the large picture-taking tourist groups but it is worth your time.  The cafe was lovely too.  I just can't get over that the buildings themselves are truly amazing and deserve to be shown off, and that admission is free.  What a gift!",Opportune Time to visit one of the best National Galleries where service is with a smile!
"July 29, 2020","With many Lockdown measures now having been lifted, now is an excellent time to visit London’s leading attractions and earlier today my wife and myself visited the National Gallery at Trafalgar Square.We had booked in advance on line and although there is no charge I would encourage all visitors to make a donation (we opted for £10 each and this represented good value for money).  All E-ticket holders are requested to assemble in Salisbury Street 15 minutes before their designated time slot and - with this in mind - there is nothing to be gained arriving any earlier as the queue control works well and visitors are called forward on schedule.After going through security, visitors need to go up 2 sets of stairs (there are tolets halfway up) and then should opt for a combination of the 3 routes (A, B & C) - all of which have an outstanding selection of paintings and take 30 mins approx to complete. Whichever combination is chosen, however, please do make a point of visiting the recently refurbished Room 32 as this is not to be missed!All in all, a most enjoyable visit - one enhanced by the excellent service provided by all the staff we met - and, hopefully, the Restaurant will be back in operation the next time we visit.",You realise how amazing the collection is when you haven't been allowed to see it
"July 26, 2020","You don't appreciate what you have until you don't have it any more.  Well done therefore to the National Gallery to opening up in a sensitive way and allowing us to enjoy their great treasures again. Our visit started with the exhibition 'Titian: Love, Desire, Death' which opened earlier in the year and than almost immediately closed because of the lockdown. In 1551, Prince Philip of Spain (the future King Phillip II) commissioned Titian to produce a series of paintings showing classical myths mostly from Ovid's 'Metamorphoses'.All six paintings, which are now spread across the world, were reunited in the National Gallery just before lockdown and have been here waiting for visitors to return.  I bet Titian never thought that the people viewing his paintings would all be wearing facemasks.....From there you exit into a room which highlights the quality of the National Gallery's own collection of Titians, alongside other artists such as Michelangelo, Parmigianio and Sabastiono del Piombo.The Gallery now has three routes for visitors to follow. Ours took us through the newly-refurbished Gallery 32 with its dazzling colour and lighting scheme past many familiar friends.  It did however make the adjacent rooms look a little dowdy.  An enjoyable visit, ending with the shop where we bought a face mask with Van Gogh's Sunflowers - one of this year's fashion accessories.... masks are going to be with us for a while.",Titian exhibition - awfully organised
"July 26, 2020","Just visited Titian exhibition - amazing paintings albeit very few of them -but the organisation is appalling which ruins the whole experience - clear example of a case when stricter rules just make it worse not safer nor more efficient. Tickets checked 3 times, everyone wears masks but the automatic door doesn’t work - so everyone touches the same handle, for some reason after presenting the tickets I was given a tiny piece of paper that I needed to handle to someone throughout the visit, no audio guide (and no app to download info) so people still crowd next to each other to read info next to each painting (so much for social distancing). To contrast - two weeks ago I was in Uffizi gallery - and that was really well organised and very safe.",Go back again and again
"July 25, 2020","How lucky are we that our galleries are free? Impossible to do in a day, or even a week, but lovely to pop in regularly. Often there’s a short talk on a particular painting at lunchtimes. ",Best Paintings in the world....
"July 21, 2020","What a building, what a selection of paintings.  We should be eternally grateful for a place like this.",Good
"July 20, 2020",Lots of history and worth a visit.  Younger children might get a bit bored quickly but we enjoyed an hour or so strolling round,a must visit Gallery
"July 19, 2020",Simply a must for any lover of art. A beautiful gallery with lots of space.Every visitor to London should visit this Gallery,superb
"July 18, 2020",we loved going it for a cultural trip in london so we would go again for the next time we visit the city ,Lots to see even if not all is open
"July 18, 2020",We came to see the Titian exhibition which is momentous as the paintings in it have not been together for some 500 years but it only takes 30 minutes to see so we spent another 90 minutes walking around the galleries. We were told 50 percent is open but that is still plenty.,Perfect Post-Lock-down Gallery Visit.
"July 17, 2020","This was a lovely way to return to visiting galleries post lockdown.I was very pleased when The National Gallery reopened and booked an open visit-something which now needs to done.The organisation is excellent- well done to the director and staff!The queue is not long, and everyone was able to enter at their allotted time. There is a choice of three routes to follow.I chose Route B, which includes the Flemish/Dutch Old Masters and The Impressionists- both favourites of mine. The route is clearly marked and the lack of crowding makes it so much easier to view the works clearly and at leisure.The staff are helpful and the whole experience is calm and relaxed.I have already booked to visit the Titian exhibition next monthAll in all, a perfect return to London's wonderful art world!",National Gallery
"October 30, 2019","I recommend spending a few hours here. Too many historic artworks to name, and the building is beautiful.",Excellent tour with guide
"October 30, 2019",My spouse and I along with our young adult son spent 3 hours at the gallery .We hired Lydia Bauman who was actually recommend by the gallery  She is an expert and can go into as much detail as you want about each painting . The 3 hours we booked her just flew by. Great way to see the highlight of this magnificent museum.,You may spend some days in here
"October 30, 2019",We liked the very freindly athmospher ang the free walk between halls.Many admierd painters from old to recent periods.,Amazing free art gallery 
"October 29, 2019",So many famous world renowned paintings all in one place. Well gone GB. Great shops and cafes too. Degas Van Gogh cezanne Monet Manet Renoir constable,when it's raining in London
"October 29, 2019",It was pouring rain on our first day in London we did not want to stay in the hotel. we went around and discovered this place by accident to avoid the rain. We spent atleast 4 hours just enjoying the paintings. We loved it very much. 4 hours is not enough to enjoy everything.beautiful building inside and out. the facilities are clean as well and they are free. highly recommended,beautiful place.
"October 29, 2019",Lovely to walk around and free admission so never feel like I must see everything in one visit and can come back again.  We arrived around 12:30 and not too busy for a Wednesday in October.  Well laid out and and you can pick up a map for a couple of  pounds. Will definitely visit on our next trip to London. ,How can you beat free?
"October 28, 2019","A terrific gallery worthy of being on your ""must see"" list while in London. Some of the world's best art for free! You could spend the better part of a day here if you had the time. Particularly a good stop if the weather turns nasty.",Impressive!
"October 28, 2019","I had no idea it would be so great, I eventually spent 3 hours watching at a great part of the history of painting..",Crowded and exhibits on loan detracted from the experience
"October 27, 2019","It's free and one can see some very famous paintings, but the crowds and the pieces that were out on loan really dampened my enthusiasm.  We spent less time than planned there.  We saw what we wanted to see and left.  It really wasn't a place to linger and reflect.",An unparalleled experience
"October 27, 2019","We had limited time at the National Gallery, but oh my it was such a delight to be able to roam those halls.  The building in and of itself is gorgeous and breathtaking on its own.  Add the pristine preserved centuries old paintings that are expertly curated and displayed and it is an awe-inspiring experience.  To see the works of Monet, Manet, Van Gogh, Titan, Cezzane, among the other greats is such a privilege and unparalleled experience.  Even better was to see young children sketching paintings and in amazement at the works before them as they listened to expert curators.  Perhaps the best part is that admission is free, although you will be heavily bombarded by employees at the entrance to the exhibits to provide a donation.  A small and worthwhile price to pay for an unparalleled opportunity...",Amazing and free
"October 21, 2019",You need a good couple of hours here to see everything because there is so much. I was amazed by the Van Goghs and Holbiens Ambassadors was stunning. The gallery is so beautiful-amazing ambience,Breathtaking
"October 21, 2019","The galleries in London are free of charge, but a donation is requested. The rooms are spacious and there are benches to take a break on.",A wonderful Sunday afternoon
"October 20, 2019","I was passing through London and was trying to decide how to spend my afternoon and realized that the National Gallery was within easy walking distance of my location.  I love wandering through art galleries so I jumped at the chance to visit this place that I'd heard so much about.The National Gallery did not disappoint.  Wandering through the galleries you find awe-inspiring paintings by Da Vinci (Virgin of the Rocks), Caravaggio (The Supper at Emmaus), Van Gogh (Sunflowers), Seurat (Bathers at Asnieres) to name just a few.  The gallery truly lives up to its description as one of the finest collections of paintings in the world.There is no admission charge to enter, but be prepared that you will be asked to make a donation as you enter.  Maps are available but there is a charge of 2 pounds for them.  There is a coffee bar and a cafe where you can get a coffee, sandwich, or something more substantial.  I believe that there is also a restaurant, but I did not try it.In summary, if you have a few hours you can spend at the National Gallery, I'm quite sure you will find it is time well spent.  I recommend more than 3 hours, but if you want to just hit the highlights, then 2-3 hours might be enough.",Among the greatest art collections in the world
"October 19, 2019",Room after room of great art works from across Europe from the 13th through the 20th centuries. Cannot be visited only once. ,Great to see the collections housed in the gallery

"October 18, 2019",The collection of old paintings from over the years is great. Even the building is amazing. Especially the paintings of Turner. ,Underrated
"October 18, 2019",While on a visit to Paris & London my wife and I visited the Louvre and other Paris museums and I must say the National Gallery is as good as any with a lot less people and free admission. Highly recommend.,Beautiful architecture to match the beautiful art.
"October 17, 2019",This free art gallery is well worth a self paced visit where even though the paintings may overwhelm you you can return often to visit your favourites.,The always excellent National Gallery
"October 17, 2019","The setting alone, in Trafalgar Square, is always a good reason to visit the National Gallery. But its collection remains among the best anywhere. Also,  it is easy to navigate; unlike, at the moment, the Louvre, which is a huge mess, especially given the current boondoggle for viewing the Mona Lisa.  And the National still has free admission!! Highly recommended.",Wish I had more time to fully experience it.
"October 2, 2019",The national gallery was incredible. So clean and organised. There was plenty of staff to help if needed and the exhibits were perfect. I will be back with more time!,Must see place
"October 2, 2019",Can’t believe that we are able to visit for the cost of however much you want to donate. So much to see and take in that one has to go back. The cafe was of high quality as well. Tried hard to avoid the shop at the exit and failed .,My favorite
"October 1, 2019","This is my favorite Gallery I've visited. Simple to navigate with well flowing rooms full of art by incredible artists. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. There is a bag check going in.The Gallery is free to the public, but they do collect donations, so please consider donating if you love the Gallery like I do. Well worth it. There is also a gift shop downstairs that has a wonderful selections of gifts and souvenirs. Love love love the National Gallery",Memorable Experience 
"October 1, 2019",This Museum rivals any I have seen anywhere. The collections are outstanding and the facility itself is beautiful inside and out. I would recommend obtaining a floor plan and marking off galleries as you go through. The rooms are a maze and I found myself doubling back on some I had seen. Be sure to set aside at least three hours to get the full experience of the Museum. If you find yourself overwhelmed take a break in the cafe. I found the impressionists section simply amazing. Admission is free. The staff are courteous and helpful. The is a cloakroom to leave your coats for a small fee. ,Fantastic museum - great to spend a whole afternoon at
"September 30, 2019",You must check out the National Gallery if you are visiting London. There is so much art work and history contained within the building and the incredible artwork from painters such as the Renaissance. Would suggest that you prepare 2-3 hours wandering slowly through the hallways - must go! :) ,One of the many free museums in London 
"September 29, 2019",You can easily spend several hours wandering through the museum. There are phenomenal collections of artworks. The Sainsbury entrance is located off of Trafalgar square. Even the flooring in the central lobby is a work of art. A mosaic of 1/2 inch square tiles.,Impromptu visit
"September 29, 2019","We popped in as the rain was torrential.  Was very open, plenty of places to sit down whilst looking at the art on display.  Clean rest rooms and a cafe too. ",Interesting as a building and for the exhibitions.
"September 28, 2019","On a limited time scheduled we enjoyed exploring a couple of the displays. The forecourt to the gallery was bustling with artists performing. So much to see outside, possibly because it was school holidays. Worth a visit.",A fantastic free gallery in London
"September 28, 2019","On a recent visit to London I spent a couple of hours looking around this magnificent art gallery. Two hours was nowhere near enough time to see all there is on offer, but it was great to spend what little time I could. Must factor in more time on my next visit.",It is a very emotional

I had high expections to the trafalgar square as its always mentioned in movies and news but to be honest there is nothing special.",Go in with a plan
"August 30, 2019","It's very crowded, especially with it's location right at Trafalgar Square.

"August 26, 2019","My first time visiting the National Gallery and I was really impressed with the early religious works, particularly some of the brilliant ultramarine works. It was also great to be able to see some of the modern works up close but this wing was pretty jammed with people.

"August 25, 2019","This is a lovely gallery with great pieces worth seeing. Given the numerous entrances, it would be helpful to have maps available at each entrance.

I actually would have given more if someone with an ipad wasn't there asking for it.  ",Must see London Museum
"August 25, 2019","What a bargain - a great collection of artworks with no admission charge.  Of course, you will want to contribute something after you finish viewing the many items.

"July 16, 2019","I go to the National Gallery every time I visit London. I love that I can just stop in to sit for a while with a Vermeer or a Turner or (insert name of your favorite artist here.) For Free! No line - especially if you’re not carrying a backpack/bag that needs a security check. I wouldn’t recommend trying to see everything at once. There’s just too much great art. Pick a room or two to soak in, and plan to return. ",Best museum in London
"June 27, 2019",A no brainer for anyone thinking about visiting this town. A lot of ehxibitions and famous paitings. ,lovely building and artwork
"June 27, 2019",the museum is located next to the Trafalgar square. staff were very friendly upon entrance. it houses a vast collection of art on different floors so there's lots to see.There is access to lifts which is great for prams and wheelchair use.I asked if one of the guys would take a picture of me and my baby which he just replied No which was unexpected. apart from that all staff were pleasant.,Exceptional exhibition on Sorolla
"June 26, 2019","I attended the exhibition on Sorolla and it was nothing but amazing.  I was blown away by the superb technique of how Sorolla captured the effect of light on his paintings, which included his beach collection, the Spanish people in traditional costumes from different parts of the country and some of the monumental sized works.  You can almost see sunlight coming through the sail of the fishing boat and the fabric of people he painted.  Highly recommended! ",Stunning gallery
"June 25, 2019","Stopped by here on the way through the Area and was not disappointed!The building is magnificent and really accentuates the stunning art on display in the halls. The busy parts of the gallery are obviously the famous pieces (Da Vinci, Monet etc). But at the height of the day in the weekend I was surprised at how easy it was to move around.Cafe is good too!",Free entry!!!
"June 24, 2019","I am not a fan of museum honestly, but thanks to London for the chance gives to all the people visiting a great please like this for free.",Sorolla exhibition

"June 22, 2019",We stopped in to see the Tudor and Victorian portrait galleries - they are really amazing to see.  No lines to get in as all museums are free in London. Well worth a visit - we skipped any modern exhibits and just focused on the Tudor and Victorian works - awesome!,Excellent free gallery
"June 21, 2019",Great gallery with a wide collection. The paid exhibition was fantastic but frustrating that you pay entrance and then pay again for an audio guide. Have visited the free collection many times and have always enjoyed it.,Free
"June 18, 2019",Wonderful gallery to spend the day with families and friends. Is possible to see the Wheat Field with Cypresses (Van Gogh) and wonderful collection of Monet. Unmissable,Great collection
"June 17, 2019","This is a great collection.  anyone who likes fine art will have an exceptional experience.  Take the time to read the captions and you will get more out of your visit,",Always such a pleasure to revisit 
"July 3, 2019","It always happens to me: National Gallery takes much more time than I originally plan. I started with the Renaissance painters, spent plenty of time enjoying my all time favorites, Leonardo’s “Virgin of the Rocks”, Botticelli’s “Venus and Mars” and his portraits. Moved on to amazing El Greco, phenomenal “Rokeby Venus” by Diego Velázquez, Van Eyck and Vermeer, several Rembrandt’s portraits, which I had seen on display recently in the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh... the list is very, very long, so I do not want to bore you with it... Around 2 pm the swarms of noisy school children have become unbearable, so I decided to take a break for lunch in the lovely National Gallery Cafe.After much needed lunch, I went to the Impressionists, the reason why I got stuck in the National Gallery for so long. What a stunning collection! The best Cezanne, Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, whom I adore... phenomenal Renoir’s portraits, beautiful Claude Monet’s landscapes, famous Manet’s paintings “The Music in the Tuileries” and “Execution of Maximilian”... I stopped paying attention to noisy school kids and completely drowned in the beauty of the paintings forgetting about everything around me. Forgot about time as well... it was already 6pm, the Gallery was closing. Will be back and hopefully soon.  ",Stunning Art
"July 2, 2019",National Gallery has stunning art work. I really enjoyed the portrait section. The museum is very large so review the map and see the sections you are interested first. Photos are allowed. There are benches in most rooms so you can sit and listen to the audio. They also have a coat room which comes in handy in the winter.,Must see
"July 2, 2019","Enjoyed seeing the art masterpiece thanks to a very helpful curator. He pointed out the must see masterpieces (Michelangelo, Da Vinci ,   and Monet) after he noticed we were walking around with no direction. Out of the three museums we went to this museum was my favourite.  FYI — Audio guide free with London Pass.  ",What a great location for a museum!
"July 2, 2019","So much to do here! There are plenty of free exhibitions as well as the paid ones. And, as well as the amazing collections of art, there is a very nice restaurant and cafe plus...the wonderful fountains of Trafalgar Square in front...",Wonderfull collection of art
"July 2, 2019",This is one of the largest and most important art museums in the world. There is no admission cost.I would recommend to take it easy to be able to enjoy the art pieces you like and visit the museum at least three different days for about 3 to 5 hours each visit.,Beautiful
"July 2, 2019","A gorgeous, free museum in the centre of Trafalgar Square. The art was fabulous and featured art by a wide range of artists including Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Claude Monet. Be prepared for it to be extremely busy. I went here just after lunch so it was definitely peak time. While trying to view Sunflowers, I really just ended up looking at the backs of peoples heads standing directly in front of the painting!! Also, try your best to ignore the scammers present at the foot of the stairs entrance, they can be annoyingly persistent towards tourists. I really enjoyed my visit to the museum, I loved being able to sit in the same chair as Q from James Bond! I definitely recommend visiting here. ",One of the best if not the best art museum in London.
"July 2, 2019","If you are passionate about art and culture, the National Gallery it’s a must visit while in London. Just the view over Trafalgar Square from the entrance is worth stepping into the building. The gallery is divided in centuries and art currents. I’d like to advice to choose the one you are most interested in (or the artists) and visit it first. The time flies in there and it’s better to prioritise what you DON’T want to miss and walk a bit faster through the other rooms. They are selling little maps at the entrance, but you can find big maps all over the building to help you with the orientation. Enjoy!!! 😉 ",Not enough time to see everything!
"July 2, 2019","It was late in the day when we made it to the National Gallery so we just hit the high points. Interestingly the area in front of the museum is quite busy with street artists, musicians, sightseers, and locals. Even if you're not interested in the museum, it's a fun place to hang out. ",A wonderful afternoon
"July 1, 2019","I visited today the Sorolla Exhibition at the National Gallery which concludes on the 7th July.I knew very little about this artist, so didn't quite know what to expect.It turned out to be a superb day out. Sorolla was a wonderful artist who bought incredible light to his paintings and made them stand out in a way that I had never seen before. The paintings seemed so ‘alive’, one of the portraits in particular seemed as though the subject was actually in the room, it was like looking at real face, not a painting of a face. It was quite incredible. It was well worth travelling to London to see this fantastic exhibition, I read that Sorolla’s work hasn’t been shown in London for around 100 years, so I count myself fortunate to have had this opportunity.",Sorolla Master of Light
"July 1, 2019",Fantastic presentation of a under appreciated master. I knew little of Sorolla and learned a great deal. The exhibit was stunning. Not to be missed.,Free and worth the time 
"June 17, 2019",We happened upon this museum on our way to China town and very much enjoyed it! Some very famous pieces are here and the gift shop was nice. Our favorite thing though was the view from the top of the steps when we exited. Beautiful! ,Give yourself plenty of time!
"June 16, 2019","I only gave myself a few hours, and wish I had more time to look around. A must for anyone with any appreciation of art.",About a weeks worth!
"June 16, 2019","Admission is free, and even if it were paid for, you couldn't possibly go wrong with spending a day here. The very fact that admission is free to such a magnificent collection of art tells us a lot about the English. It is stupendous. You could easily come back every day for a week and not see it all.",Sorolla exhibition
"June 8, 2019",I always enjoy visiting here for both the free galleries & special exhibitions. The difference this time is I now use a wheelchair. Having prior experience meant I knew my way round & location of lifts. As always there is plenty to see. Staff were very helpful. I enjoyed the Sorolla exhibition. Some lifts are quite small. Disabled facilities are fine and help was given at the cafe to carry my food to a table.,Amazing art and artists
"June 7, 2019","After a day of sightseeing we headed to the National Gallery. We were tired and knew the visit would be rushed but this was our only chance. My husband is a wheelchair user and upon entering where we did, possibly not the main entrance, it wasn’t immediately clear where the main galleries were or what route we should take and no one to assist. We realised we’d need to go up the lift. Young ladies asking for donations once up and inside. I’d rather just pay a small entrance fee than it be free and be guilted into donating. Either way it’s massive value for money obviously, just a small annoyance. We didn’t see anywhere to get a map or assistance so started wandering through the nearest room. It’s a beautiful building inside and out, located on Trafalgar Square with lots of the usual food outlets around the square, lots of people and buzz. After wandering several rooms we got the hang of the flow and following the room numbers. We were totally gobsmacked. So many high quality artists and works all in one place. Hard to take in really, what we were seeing. Just incredible landscape, portrait and religious paintings, small and large. My husband drooling over all the Rembrandts and me just about everything else. Love that you can take photos, no flash. People were largely very accommodating allowing the wheelchair to move through the galleries and help with all the doors, and allowing room near the paintings. We could have spent half a day but had to keep a steady pace. So don’t let time out you off. It is doable in a few hours, just not preferable.",amazing art
"June 6, 2019","the gallery is near trafalgar square and entranceis free, u can enjoy 2 or three floors of great art, sometimes they do show contemporary art as well",Beautiful place!
"June 5, 2019","Lovely atmosphere is gorgeous, kept clean and quiet and very well organised with large group visits.",WOW
"June 5, 2019",If you love museum you will certainly love the National Gallery.Higly recommended for tourists and Londoners as well.,Spend The Day
"June 4, 2019","The price of admission is zero. You can spend the morning, go for lunch, spend the afternoon, go for dinner, and come back at night. Is there a better way to spend a day? Not a one.",It’s free! 
"June 4, 2019","And therefore can be crowded so go early. Nicely laid out, easy to navigate, wonderful collection. We didn’t have time for a docent-led tour but we would definitely take one during our next visit. Had lunch in the cafeteria and it was very good, not a lot of seating, however.

"June 15, 2019","Really nice art collection and free museum. We enjoyed the impressionists (Monet), Van Gogh, large British paintings, Boticelli etc. on top floor. We live in Chicago and love the Art Institute’s extensive collection, and this was a very nice collection. Definitely worth it if you have time. It closed at 5pm and were able to see a lot in an hour. ",Nice quiet spot
"June 13, 2019","Beautiful impressionist paintings. The Portrait Gallery is currently unavailable, disappointing as it was our reason for going. Nice quiet spot to get away from the crowds.",What More can You Ask For
"June 12, 2019",An opportunity to look round a Gallery overlooking Trafalgar Square and Nelsons Column. Free to enter and lots of different visitor attractions inside. See some of the worlds famous artists and their often overlooked works up close is a real pleasure. Spend an hour or 4  just wandering round at your leisure this is one of those attractions in London that makes visitors from overseas come back again and again. No its not all lights camera action - its a museum for goodness sake but well worth a wander round just to say you have been and for its amazing setting.,"A strange experience, for me, but an essential visit"
"June 11, 2019","I spent the whole afternoon here. I'm retired in my sixties now, I last visited when I was an art student in the 1970s. Its a place everyone should see at least once. The permanent exhibition contains world famous masterpieces one after another, mostly pre-1900 art. So many I've seen too often in reproduction that I have become tired of them, suddenly there in the original so I really can peer at the brushwork and the underpainting and the sometimes dodgy filling in of backgrounds. A reminder that even the greatest artists were still human. So I experienced the odd sensation of some little known works rising sharply in my appreciation while some 'masterpieces' were a disappointment. Here's another Constable, that's another Velasquez, there's another Turner. Ho hum, ho hum, ho hum. But wow! look at this! Susanna at Her Bath by Francesco Hayez, stunningly erotic. Or Joseph Wright's Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump, amazing control of lighting. I also greatly enjoyed the two temporary exhibitions, the major one being the Spanish artist Sorolla 'master of light', the smaller one of works by the contemporary abstract artist Sean Scully. To say there's 'something for everybody' is a cliche and an exaggeration, but it would be hard to find a broader introduction to the history of western classical painting. Yes, its western (predominantly European). Yes its predominantly classical (but includes impressionist work). And yes its all painting, not sculpture.",Gallery of the greats
"June 11, 2019","There is a tremendous collection of Western art in the National Gallery with works by da Vinci, the Renaissance Masters, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Monet - a parade of the greats covering medieval to 20th century post Impressionism.  You don’t have to pay to enter so this Feast is yours for free or a donation should you choose to make it.  Highlights for me were the Constable’s The Hay Wain, Rousseau’s Tiger in a Tropical Storm, Leonardo’s Virgin of the Rocks and the Holy Family, and the Wilton Diptych.  I had been waiting a lifetime to see these.  I also discovered a good many paintings that I didn’t know.  The gallery is split into many rooms and it is fun to wander but never get truly lost.   For a rainy Monday in June, the place was not too busy.  I felt unrushed and unobstructed walking around.  ",Very nice visit
"June 10, 2019","Art from XV Century to today with artist like degas, constable, da vinci, van gogh etcA Pleasant visit to open our eyes to beauty.",Great art in a walkable museum
"June 9, 2019","This was my fourth visit to the National Gallery. It is a stone’s throw away from Parliament is n Trafalgar Square which allows you visit several sites easily in a day. The admission is free but you must donate to get a museum map. There are tons of dosents to assist you if you choose to wander on your own. If you are familiar with NYC’s Met the National Gallery is much smaller but still chock full of amazing art. My favorites include the Vermeers, Renoirs, Van Goeghs, Monets, Degas and Klimt.",Vacation
"May 22, 2019",Thoroughly enjoyed browsing the National Gallery and recommend anyone visiting London to check it out.,Wonderful Art Museum!
"May 22, 2019",If you love art it is a must for you. The museum entrance is free. Donations are encouraged. Maps are 2 pounds and worth getting as the museum is quite large. Plan your visit ahead so you can see your favorite artists and maximize your time.,One of the world’s great museums
"May 21, 2019","Quite wonderful. You could spend days in this place. A great collection of Flemish art, but much much more.",Perfect

The organization is good, the lighting mostly fine.The only disappointment comes when a loved painting is out on tour :-(",Fantastic gallery to visit
"May 20, 2019","We were in London for a short break early in May, and spent a few hours in this wonderful gallery. It was very full and also very hot, really uncomfortably so . Luckily for foot weary visitors like us, there were comfy sofas to collapse into every now and again. We were very keen on seeing the two Vermeers and also the Jan Steens in the same room (Room 16). They were wonderful.  We also loved William Hogarth's satirical series Marriage -A-la-Mode (Room 35) and George Stubbs Whistlejacket - incredible painting of a race horse that hits you in the eye even before you enter the room. Another painting we saw that I won't forget was Elisabeth L. V. Le Brun's  ""Self portrait in a straw hat"", an 18C French painter. One doesn't see many female painters and she painted beautifully. A very interesting  few hours spent in the National Gallery.",amazing collection of works
"May 20, 2019",I love going to the National - the best place in London for anyone who adores art but doesn't have £100mil to buy their own collection  - amazing collection of works ,Impressionists and Vermeer
"May 20, 2019",We only saw a small fraction of the exhibits but there are 2 Vermeer and several impressionists which we enjoyed.,Bidda
"May 20, 2019","I love The Impressionists, The National Gallery advertised for Sorolla (Spanish Master of Light), never heard of him!  A Spanish Impressionist Painter, fantastic exhibit.  If you love art, don’t miss it!  Open daily, a small charge of approx 15 pounds entry fee. Check dates because the exhibit ends in the summer!  At the same time, there are many other paintings at the National Gallery!  I spent three and a half hours.  The Gallery overlooks Tralfagar Square.

"April 8, 2019","The best thing about the National Gallery is that it's free to enter. You can pay a few extra pounds to get an audio guide but it comes free with the London Pass. I'd recommend getting an audio guide.Since this is a huge space full of art, make a list of the pieces you want to see so you can pretty much plan out your visit. They have Van Goghs, Klimts, and other pieces that art enthusiasts would love.",Fantastic Collection

"March 31, 2019","If you don’t know anything about painting and art, you may want to skip this. Typical day is busy with students. Enjoy painting from Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Raphael, Monet and Van Gough. One of the best gallery I’ve seen so far. ",Best free London thing to do inside
"March 31, 2019","It's a great museum seemingly focused on impressionist and earlier eras. Very good painting notes (and lots of seating!) make this a pleasure to browse. Since the collections tend to focus on variety vs. depth, it's particularly good for the easily-distracted or bored. And you can do this in a half-day, so it's great to add to Covent Garden, Parliament, and other nearby attractions.If you can (before late May 2019), I highly recommend the Boilly exhibit of Parisian scenes. It's one of the best exhibits I've seen for this era and exceptionally well-annotated to provide new discoveries.",Gorgeous art and cool builidng
"March 30, 2019",It was fun to walk around the National Gallery. The collection is excellent although Van Gogh's Sunflowers are on loan to the Tate. That was disappointing to miss that but collection was beautiful and well worth the time. Considering it's free-you can't beat the price. ,Lovey escape from the busy crowds
"April 28, 2019","We wandered in here to get out of the sun for a wee while, I loved walking around this place and looking at all of the amazing paintings.The building is impressive inside and not overcrowded like some of the tourist places. There was always a quiet space to take in the paintings and relax.I would definitely visit here again.",The Sorolla exhibition
"April 26, 2019",Went specifically to the Sorolla exhibition. Must declare that I'm a big fan of his work. The exhibits were the best and most I've seen so far. I have seen some of his work in Madrid and visited his studio. I thought the ticket price was more than worth it for the large number of works on display. He is a relatively unknown outside of Spain but deserves to have a wider audience.,Good impromptu visit.
"April 26, 2019","Didn’t plan to drop in but decided to as we walked thru Trafalgar Sq. Kids loved to see some original master pieces, enjoyed the quiet and the fancy (if expensive) coffee shop. Take your kids, you might be surprised!",Tudors and Stuarts
"April 24, 2019",Went along with my daughter before going to the theatre. Wanted to seethe Tudor and Stuart’s galleries. Really great paintings and interesting notations alongside the paintings. Loved the miniatures....Could have spent all afternoon in there.,Fabulous! 
"April 23, 2019","We took the children as we felt they should have a fleeting visit, we were there longer than expected!I asked a staff member for advice about the best place to take the children (4 and 7),he was very helpful. A great experience! ",Brilliant Exhibition
"April 20, 2019","The joys of the permanent collection are well documented, so I will focus on the recent ""paid for"" exhibition: Sorolla: Master of Light. Simply outstanding. The gallery's recent use of lesser known impressionists (I recall the Australian Impressionist show with delight) has been a revelation. This exhibition featured the whole range of this comparatively obscure Spaniard's works, with excellent labelling and an equally excellent film presentation.",Absolutely extraordinary 
"April 17, 2019",What else needs to be said? Incredible collection and The Turner Wing is an absolute must if you pay visit.,Pre Renaissance and Renaissance galleries are fantastic
"April 15, 2019",Being the national gallery any serious visitor has to visit it over a few days... as any time can be spent looking at these masterpieces from the 15th or 16th century. They are really well sorted and still impressed by the quality of the paintings there. ,Lunch break visit
"April 14, 2019","Most lunch times I will grab a seat within the Gallery and take in the details on a different painting each day. No phone, no headset. This place never gets boring!",Renaissance treat
"April 13, 2019",Superb collection in content and display. central location and reasonably priced refreshments for all.,Impressed with Impressionism
"March 25, 2019","I took an Uber (very convenient from The Tower of London) to Trafalgar Square, walked over to the National Gallery in 2 min. Got straight in at 4:30pm, free and no line. Went straight to the paintings I wanted to see (research online because some of them were on loan somewhere else) and I was done by 5:50 - closes at 6pm.

The layout and division of art work is very pleasing as you walk through different eras and see the painting change in different centuries. It has a beautiful restaurant/café to sit and relax before you charge yourself to be on the move again, but the café can get busy sometimes.Also it’s free entry!

Don't forget the National Portrait Gallery next door...a real gem.",Amazing
"November 11, 2018","An excellent visit.  Entrance is by donation which seems quite voluntary - pay on the way out if you want to assess the value first.   Do your homework before arriving, by artist, most famous works etc  - it is not really possible to see everything in one day.  ",Always Impresses.

The building and architectural touches of the gallery are in themselves beautiful; the collection of art is priceless.  During our visit and until January 20, 2019, the museum features among other special exhibitions The Courtauld Impressionists From Manet to Cezanne.  This exhibition shown in 40 masterpieces on loan from The Courtauld Gallery which is also located in London overwhelms with beauty.  If you are a fan of impressionistic art, this exhibition is worth a trip to London as is the National Gallery itself.  Besides the art, there is a wonderful gift shop and a tasty  cafeteria type restaurant.",Mantegna and Bellini are show-stoppers

The cafes serve acceptable food.",Surprising
"January 6, 2019",I had pre conceptions about this place.  Expected it to be full of oils of lord and lady so and so - and there are plenty of them.  But I was pleasantly surprised by the contemporary content - worth a visit.,If there is one place to visit in London it is this
"January 6, 2019",Every time I visit London I go to the National Gallery- sometimes several times. It has a great collection of paintings - mostly non- British and non contemporary. The British paintings are at Tate Britain and the contemporary paintings in Tate Modern. All three are great but the National Gallery has the biggest and the widest collection of all. It is overwhelming and for the first visit it is best to take a free guided tour and choose either to spend time in one hall or tow. Alternately buy a book at the great bookshop downstairs and just look at the 50 most famous paintings. DOnt spend more than two hours there! It is free and so go many times for a short while rather than spend a day.,As good as it gets
"January 3, 2019","If looking a painting across the ages this is as good as it gets.  One of the worlds great collections, beautifully displayed.  Only issue was the Lanseer exhibition when we were there.  Very limited few paintings and sketches. ",Art Lovers Heaven

"November 7, 2018",We take a tour that began here. It’s our second time visiting here. It’s a place that you can visit again and still revile new things to fucos on. place to go between different rooms and see those spaciel works. Recommended !! Even the children weren’t bored for a minute,"First class museum, and free!"
"November 6, 2018","I love the London National Gallery and visit it every time in London. I don’t get tired of seeing Van Gogh’s Sunflowers over and over. The main collection is varied. There are 2 buildings. You can’t miss it in Trafalgar Square. Don’t forget to go into the gift shop. I love my Sunflowers mug and tea towel. Sure you can get most things on line, but the memory of getting it at the Gallery makes it so much more enjoyable. Depending on your endurance, go a few times for a few hours each time.",World class
"November 6, 2018","Most museums are designed and managed with a focus on the convenience of their staff and the vision of the curators and directors.The Gallery is all about the visitor. The light is just so that the viewing pleasure is maximised. Ridiculously confortable seating invites those who wish to rest, or to pause in awe before tgeur favourite masterpieces... or to nap. The other places tend to have obnoxious staffers gawking at a standing crowd of Hoi Polloi. The staff here is discreet, smiling, knowledgeable and helpful. Once I could not remember Mantegna's name and I just asked one of tge doormen where I could find a small drawing of a tomb in trompe l'oeil by a guy with an Italian name. Try that at the Louvre or the Uffizi... this guy never blin ked, ""Woukd that be Samson and Delilah by Mantegna? Room ..., sir, enjoy your visit"".The collection is wonderful. Arguably, together with the twin gallery, the world's finest painting collection. But the setting tops even the collection and the staff is out of this world.A place to spend many happy hours. Plus, you pay or not, admission is free, so even if you are broke or living hand to mouth this is a whale of a program for lovers of art and refinement.",Take Your Time
"November 6, 2018","This is a great gallery to take an hour or three to wander around.  I enjoyed it as much as the Prado and it is not as overwhelming as the Louvre.  There is ample seating in most rooms, so when the hard floor wins the battle with your gel insoles, you can rest up and enjoy.  Just don't expect the free wifi reception to be very good.Lots of Dutch masters, some Turner will put you in the mood for contemplative cocktail somewhere.",Great impressionist paintings
"November 6, 2018",The was a Courtald exhibition on when we went and it had some fantastic impressionist paintings. It's almost impossible to see the whole gallery in one go. Highly recommended. ,Reminder
"November 6, 2018",I haven't made good use of the permanent exhibition for years. I was shocked to see so many great paintings from masters from all over the world! ,loving van gogh
"November 5, 2018","you can find a lot of pictures there with a lot of history, my favourite is sunflowers by vincent van gogh",A treasure trove
"November 3, 2018","We were there for the (excellent) Courtauld Impressionist exhibition, but afterwards we looked through a few more galleries. There are famous paintings everywhere and you need a lot more time than we had to do it justice. The building itself is very handsome and the galleries feel spacious, although in the middle of a weekday it was still very busy.",Very pleasent

"October 28, 2018",One of the greatest galleries in Europe. A must-see in London. Allow yourself 3 hours minimum for the whole collection. This time it had an added value for us with the temporary impressionism collection. Treat for the eyes.,Art for all.
"October 26, 2018","Having not visited for a few years I was really looking forward to seeing everything on offer. If you are time poor you cannot appreciate all that's here.Lots of positives, nice shop, coffee shop, toilets. Special exhibitions at an extra cost.Negatives are the huge money boxes and in your face collectors as you enter the building suggesting £5 donations. Museums and Galleries should be free for all to enjoy. Not everyone can afford £5 every time. As a visitor I should not feel under pressure to pop a note, suggested or otherwise into the mansize money box. I feel I contribute through taxes, buying books/ gifts, having a coffee and returning to appreciate the works displayed.Expect to walk, seats are nicely placed to rest and take in the room. Lifts are available for those in need of assistance.  It's always busy.I would suggest you allow time to visit, at least a couple of hours. Then if you feel up to it pop in the Gallery next door.We need to support our museums and Galleries but, not with the in your face handover your money approach. A fiver in the box is less money to spend elsewhere in the Gallery. The pleasure of buying a book, bag or gift is taken away if you have handed money over under pressure/ encouragement of staff. Need to rethink this one!",A must see

"October 15, 2018","We went to the museum on Friday night when it is open late.  To be honest the place was not lighted very well for an evening visit,  We had to use our lights on our phones to read the displays and it was very dark in the large rooms.  Seeing the Rosetta Stone was a highlight and the Greek rooms were great, what we could see of them.  The place is huge, so if you have limited time you really need to cherry pick things to see,",Beautiful Museum
"October 15, 2018",The collection at this museum is wonderful.  Just wish the Caravaggio room hadn't been closed during our visit.  That was the only letdown.  ,Beautiful collection of paintings covering the history of painting from more or 14th -19th century.
"October 14, 2018","I have been at the national gallery many times and always find it inspiring and discover new things. It has a nice collection on impressionists and also of Dutch Masters. I also love the collections of Iconic paintings. Because of it's central location you can also walk in and out just for 30 min or so. In the basement there are often themed expositions that go deeper into specific subjects. All in all, a must see for London. ",An important institution for culture and art

"October 9, 2018","Had originally gone to see Van Gogh's ""Sunflower"" painting but discovered that the ""Courtauld Impressionists: From Manet to Cézanne"" was also on. Was delighted to be able to see the extra paintings for  a relatively small charge. Well Worth the Visit!!!",Unfathomably amazing
"October 7, 2018","Free admission, rooms upon rooms upon rooms of gorgeous art from various artists (including some very well known ones). I usually don’t love art museums, but this one left me speechless.","One of my favorite places, and it's free!"
"October 5, 2018","You can spend hours and hours here looking at great masterpieces, but my favorites are the Impressionists from the later 1800s, such as Monet, Renoir, Cezanne, and Degas.Right outside, there's Trafalgar Square and buzzing humanity to entertain you!",Incredible visit
"October 4, 2018","We lined up about 45 minutes before opening - were among the first few in the front of the line to brave the rain that morning. It was well well worth it. I recommend getting in line well before opening. Even though there were many people visiting that day it did not feel overcrowded. Skip the restaurant - the service is very slow and the coffee was just ok - and the hot chocolate was not the best. But alas, we were not there for the food or drink anyhow.",Accessible Public Art

"October 3, 2018",A great way to spend a Saturday. The National Gallery offers art to please most art lovers. And entry is free.,We had an outstanding docent tour
"October 3, 2018","We went on a docent tour led by Helen.  I have been on many docent tours over the years, and she is one of the best.  Besides being very knowledgeable, and easily able to shift to another work of art when one is too crowded by other groups, she was amusing, entertaining and engaging.The museum is outstanding, but it's difficult (for me) to know where to start on where to focus without a tour.",Great art

"August 27, 2018","The National Gallery is a favorite of mine to visit in London as its entrance is free but at the same time, the exhibits are always a pleasure to see. It does tend to get crowded at times but i love that they have seating so when you’re tired, you can people-watch in peace. The staff is very helpful and I believe knowledgeable enough about the pieces on display. The special exhibitions are always interesting, but my favorite is their Impressionist exhibit. The museum is large enough but not so large as to overwhelm.The gift shops are nice as well if a bit pricey. Good quality items on sale like books, umbrealls etc.It’s also next to the National Portrait Gallery which is an interesting visit.  The location is so central that you’ll find a good restaurant, shop or theater in a few minutes.",always a joy.

"August 23, 2018","Very easy to get to this location by tube or hop on hop off bus and in fact the square with its sculptures and columns is an impressive site and worth the trip on its own. Entry is free, but the interior collection of art works was a little underwhelming considering the options on offer in other parts of London. Worthy of a visit for the art critic or historian, but otherwise, save your money and travel to Florence.",World-class painting gallery
"August 20, 2018","It is one of the most famous and most relevant galleries in the world. Be prepared for a few hours spent inside, if you want to see art from all periods displayed in the National Gallery. Not to be missed when in London!","So much to see, so little time!"
"August 16, 2018","We passed five hours here, enjoying the art and the commentaries provided on the audio tour. The range of art is incredible and the buildings are structurally beautiful.

"July 21, 2018","An incredible catalogue of masterpieces from 13th to 20th century. It’s probably too much to visit in one day, we’ll be back again next trip to a London.It is recommended to get the audio guide (10 £ family package for 4) that will give detailed info on each painting. Photos are allowed, with no flash and no selfie stick. Most crowded area was the impressionists and Van Gogh rooms. ","Brilliant, free, not to be missed"
"July 20, 2018","Make sure you go into the Turner, Constable, Gainsborough room. Three of England's great artists in one fabulous room. What a glorious place. And it's free. Amazing. Well, done London, you show the world how it should be done.",Covent Garden

"May 28, 2018","To be face to canvas with art work done by names of historical significance is awe inspiring. Having never been an art lover, I've become a National Gallery addict. The shop and display next door is also a worthwhile venture. The newly renovated cafe downstairs no longer serves scones but has a nice atmosphere. Food was good and after a half day of walking a welcome break. I tried the ""Fish Pie""... tasty. Something here has drawn me back 7 times.",Numerous visits
"May 28, 2018","What a fantastic gallery to visit. It is huge and I have spent several happy afternoons wandering through the various sections.

"May 21, 2018","Located directly at Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery is perfect even for the not-so-artsy spirit, because it’s free to visit and you can check out only a coupleof paintings and spend 10 minutes there, or hang out the whole day surrounded by some of the world’s most famous artists. Right now (May 2018) they have one copy of van Gogh’s Sunflowers there (2nd floor, room 43), which by itself is worth the visit. It is surrounded by other impressionists that deserve equal attention, though, so it makes for a very rewarding visit. ",Artistic Majesty
"May 21, 2018",Three centuries of Royal and aristocratic collecting are on display at this magnificent and free museum. I always make a beeline for the 17th century Dutch collection but no matter your preferences there is something for every taste.,One of the world´s great art museums
"September 7, 2017","From medieval art to Picasso - you will find a rich supply of pieces of art, many of which are so important that they are reproduced in text books on the history of art. My personal approach is to buy a guidebook and read before entering since such books focus on the gems of the collection, which I then hopefully recognize. Mostly I return another day for a ""consolidating"" visit. In this museum, a third and even fourth day is not vasted.",Amazing
"August 31, 2017",So beautiful and wonderful art.  Wish I had more time as there is so much to see.  Give yourself about 1 day.,Could have stayed all day.
"August 29, 2017","What an amazing pace, painting after painting of the Old Masters, I could have wandered about all day, loved it.",So many wonderful pieces of art in one location
"August 29, 2017",We thoroughly enjoyed the Gallery.  It was organized by art periods which made it extremely interesting to view the pieces by eras.,Big gallery - leave plenty of time!
"August 28, 2017","As an art student who has never been here, I thought it was time to pay a visit. It's free entry! I was astonished by this, but pleasantly surprised - donations are welcome; I'd rather purchase a guide book.This place is huge, and takes plenty of time to look around, so make sure you leave lots of time to visit. Also, don't just visit because it's raining, we went on a sunny day and the building allows natural light to flood in, allowing you to view the paintings in their natural colours.I found the best way to explore this gallery was in room order, starting at room 1. Wander in, have a look around, and pick the painting that catches your attention - there'll be one in every room. That's how I like to view paintings. There are so many amazing canvases, that there is almost an embarrassment of riches, so seek out what you like!Highlights for me; Van Gogh's 'Sunflowers' are as impressive as you think, Holbein's 'The Ambassadors' is impressive in it's scale and execution; Turner's 'The Fighting Temeraire' looks better in real life than any photograph can ever show. Vigee Le Brun 'Self Portrait in a Straw Hat' is a fantastic painting - particularly worthy of note as a painting by a woman in a gallery dominated by men.The women's loo's, I am advised, weren't fantastic - my wife was an unwilling participant in a game of 'find the toilet paper' Hence, I've docked a mark on my review. However, our tea and coffee from the espresso bar were nice, and the two shops (they want your money!) were well stocked, and not just with tat. Staff were friendly and helpful. This isn't a place to visit to fill some time, you must put this on your list of places to visit. Oh; it's an art gallery, with paintings displayed for viewing; it's not a place with interactive exhibitions for bored kids who haven't learned how to appreciate paintings, so bear this in mind. And to top it all, it faces Trafalgar Square. What's not to like?","Wonderful, FREE art gallery"
"August 24, 2017","The National Gallery is immediately to the north of Trafalgar Square, and is open to everyone without charge.  That said, a 5 pound donation / person is requested.   Still a huge bargain, as this is a world-class art gallery with works across a wide range of styles and periods.   Allow at least 2 hours (preferably 3) to enjoy this wonderful institution.","Soul,friendship and presents."
"August 22, 2017","As you enter one of the greatest art collections of the world,you gasp. You gasp not just at the top notch quality of so much to be studied in a lifetime there but to be absorbed with  pleasure in a day of what catches your eye and leads you astray. To be in a building where,if you are Italian or Dutch you can feel thrillingly robbed by pillaging of all the great painting that might  have been at home. You will be shocked and overwhelmed by this legendary parade at the heart of London.        The there is the wrapping and all ther rest: The cafes ,the best restaurant off Trafalgar Square and the best present in town to be bought as classy but  modest,from  informal trips to what to buy at Christmas.There is the catching up on art history,the special once in a life time events and  where to meet your favouritre people without breaking the bank.",Boring!😴
"August 22, 2017","Not a place for children.. we went on a school tour, thinking they may do something interactive but all they got was an hour of talking to about paintings!. Even the adults were bored!. The children asked when they were leaving & was this it, & how bored they were.We went outside to go to the station & found some buskers who were dancing that became their highlight!. ","Don't think this needs my recommendation, but ..."
"August 16, 2017","If you have a few hours you must go. It is free to enter the museum and there are beautiful exhibits, including special exhibits.",Simply the Best
"August 16, 2017","Imagine a museum full of beautiful pictures right in the centre of a fascinating city. There are no queues, no entrance fees. And even from right outside its doors you have a beautiful view. And should you lose your way this is no catastrophe but a chance to make new discoveries. And in less than no time the friendly warders will put you on the right path again. I have only one grumble: the silly picture takers. There you are, lost in the contemplation of one of your favourites, and snap! snip! one of those barbarians enters the room, draws his/her ""smart"" phone, and snap! snip! kills the picture, and  snap! snip! the picture legend, and then hurries off to his or her next victim. ""Stop and look"", I would like to shout, ""make use of your eyes (and your brain) and give this beauty a chance.""",National Faffery
"August 9, 2017","Overcrowded with selfie takers.  Bag check queue, ok fair enough but then to have to queue up for a second bag check after we'd been to the cafe is ridiculous.  Avoid except early in the morning",JMW Turner
"August 8, 2017","Wanted to see The Fighting Temeraire by Turner. Wonderful painting, saw lots more too. There is no entrance fee, surprisingly but they ask for a £5 donation which is reasonable when you consider the number of wonderful paintings and the upkeep of the building.",National Gallery
"August 7, 2017",We enjoyed walking around the National Gallery and looking at the amazing artwork. The street performers out front were cool too. I recommend picking up the guide to help you get around. ,Gorgeous
"July 31, 2017",I go to National Gallery regularly and always stop at the entrance hall to admire the beauty of the ceilings and the staircase.There are frequent exhibitions but it's worth to go and look at the permanent pieces.,Chris Ofili's Tapestries
"July 27, 2017","Grayson Perry's doing them, an now another male artist tackles large scale tapestry.The story is well told, with a special installation of preparatory drawings and the finished piece in a muralled room. The work is technically challenging, pushing the craft to another level managing to imitate watercolor with wool.Of course other treasures in the gallery include: impressionist 'greatest hits', Flemish, Dutch and Southern European masters, including a current comparative exhibition of Rembrandt and contemporaries, and of course early Renaissance work. One of the most interesting galleries is the ""gallery A"" in the basement at Orange Street entrance end. It's a hotch-potch of periods of work deemed second rate! (Academy & 'school of...) You can get up a little closer and they are hung closer and in a much more comparative manner.",Don't miss this amazing art gallery
"July 26, 2017",A wonderful range of incredible paintings representing different periods. It is also a beautiful building and not to be missed.,All the big names
"July 26, 2017","If you have some spare time in London, just jump in for a glance at some of the biggest names in painting and more. And it's free!",Fantastic
"July 13, 2017","Very big and great! If you like or don't the art, there is everything for everyone. Go to visit. Peaceful, beautiful place and so many interesting artworks",The treasures of our Nation
"July 12, 2017","If you see nothing else in this iconic building, spend some time looking at Leonardo's Maddona of the Rocks. This transcendental and life affirming work will lift your heart and refresh your spirit. The gallery is a treasure house of art from the National collection. Get there early to avoid the crowds.",Varied collection of top artists
"July 11, 2017","The National Gallery has an impressive art collection from the 12th to the early 20th Century, well presented in lovely rooms and with clear explanations.  There is a room (quite large) dedicated to the English painters, Constable, Gainsborough, Turner, Reynolds, Stubbs.  The french impressionists are well represented, with Cezanne, Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Seurat, Degas and Renoir among others.  There was a special exhibition of Rembrandt and Rubens.  Lots of others, too many to mention.  An art lovers feast. ",The Immortal Leonardo Da Vinci
"December 5, 2017","National Gallery in London is one of the most beautiful treasures of the mankind where you can see remarkable paintings from the Early Renaissance to the French Impressionists.  Whenever I go to London, I always take several hours to re-visit it or  at least to see again two of Leonardo's Masterpieces, The Virgin of the Rocks and The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist.  I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that after many years, The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist.was moved to a better place in the Gallery where the value of this fantastic drawing is so well highlighted .  If you go there, take a close look at the face of The Virgin.  You have never seen anything like that, the Beauty and the Joy of the Virgin, while looking with motherly love at  the baby Christ and baby John the Baptist.Do not be concerned about costs because THERE IS NO ENTRANCE FEE",Awesome!
"November 15, 2017","It's one of the best art galleries in the world in my opinion. The works range from early medieval up to the turn of the 20th century. Some real stand out pieces here from all the major artists. It is very large, with lots of rooms, but the paintings are well spaced out. It's got a good cloakroom £1.50 per item, plus a nice restaurant to have a snack or cuppa. They also do free 1 hour tours which I did today - lots of good info about the building and some of the key paintings. Lovely large art book shop too. Oh yes, it's free entry too. 600 years of great art for free!",George Stubbs Visit
"November 14, 2017","Reception told me where George Stubbs ""Whistle Jacket"" was, and I was off. Husband couldn't keep up with me. I was determined to see that painting before all others. It's positioning in the gallery on the 3rd floor, allowed me to see it from afar, and I couldn't move fast enough. I traveled thousands of miles and decades of my life to finally see Whistle Jacket in person. As I was only 2 half glass doors away, I broke into sobs - I'm sure the security folks thought me strange, but I was here. Finally! That painting was mine to admire for as long as I wanted....For FREE!From this George Stubbs fan who came to this museum for only 1 painting - It is a must see, even if you aren't an art fan. Just saying to your grandchildren you saw ""Sunflowers"" in person is a epic.Please enjoy all this museum has to offer. Even my husband was moved by a painting or two, and I never thought that would happen. ",great visit
"November 13, 2017",A fascinating variety of art and the collection can be viewed for free. just being inside is a treat.,Very artistic place
"November 6, 2017","It is a lovely and a place full of art. If you have a spare day I would recommend going there to fill yourself with a magic of art. It is quite a large museum, would probably take you around 3 hours if quick look through each painting :) I've been there few times already and I would go again :)",Must see
"November 4, 2017","The free entry in London Museums is a great idea to give everyone the opportunity to see and appreciate art. It's not common in other places, so I think that leave an offer it's the correct response. The collection is stunning, Monet, Van Gogh ( one of his famous Sunflowers ) Renoir, Seurat, Turner, Rubens, Raffaello, Tiziano, Leonardo (La Vergine delle Rocce) Michelangelo, Guercino... count at least 3 hours to visit the most important master pieces. The buildings is also interesting ti see, if you go to London you have to stop here.",Beautiful!
"April 22, 2018",This museum houses some of the most incredible works of art in the world. The building itself is a work of art in gorgeous architecture and design. Unfortunately I only had a few hours here. You can easily spend an entire day here and still not see everything. If you are an art lover this is a must see. And like all London Museums it's free.,Always take time to go
"April 17, 2018",This is a must if you have a spare hour. Some very impressive and famous works of art here and it is a personal favourite of mine.,Monet & Architecture
"April 16, 2018",I went to see this exhibition on Saturday morning. I had booked the tickets online. It was all very well organised. I thorougly enjoyed Monets exhibition. I learned so much about Monet as a person as apposed to his works. I found it very informative. It was very busy but i only realised while there that it had only opened since the Monday. If I were living in London I think I would go during the week. It was hard to see the pieces properly. Everyone was walking in front of everyone. At one point I seemed to be following a man with his young child whom he had in his arms so it was difficult to see the paintings. I just went a different route but I did go through it quicker than i would have liked because of the crowds. It would be great if they had some system of ways to walk around and if people wanted to stay longer on one piece there would be room to go around them. I thoroughly enjoyed it though. So glad I got to see some of Monets pieces.,A delight
"April 2, 2018","Went in again to enjoy the collections that are on display in this wonderful place last Sunday (Easter Sunday). The place is so massive that you can spend a full day in there just looking at works from all those talented artists and soak in their works. And the best thing is it’s for free!!! Was very crowded especially when you get into the display of famous artists like Van Gogh, Gaugin, Renoir to name a few. It sure is a place worth a visit!! ",Incredible art gallery
"April 1, 2018",London has some of the best free art galleries and museums.  They ask for a donation of £5 but it is not  mandatory.  The art works on display here are some of the best in the world.  Be sure to visit - must do.,Tim and Tom's tour
"March 28, 2018",We had an hour to spare and spent this time looking at selected art works. It would be possible to spend at least half a day here...so many famous artworks and artists on display and beautifully and peacefully laid out. A wonderful experience,Love this gallery
"March 24, 2018",Britain's National Gallery is a real gem. Admission is free although you should make a contribution. Great exhibits and rarest of rare-the security guards are even friendly,Very impressive collection
"March 24, 2018","Very impressive collection of amazing paintings- but so huge that you need a minimum of 3-4 hours to do full justice to it! The staff were largely helpful and cooperative. While the entry is free, you are expected to donate £10",NG
"March 23, 2018","Excellent visit. Give yourself at least 3 hours to take it all in. Go early if weekend, it gets very crowded. Also, visit National Portrait Gallery around the corner.",Incredible
"March 13, 2018",Unbelievable collection.....spent 4 hours messmerized.....All the great impressionists were there.   Probably my favorite stop in all of London.,Big group - a few youngsters and adults
"November 1, 2017","Was a great time but A LOT of walking. Was exhausted after but the teenagers all enjoyed themselves. A lot to see, something for all ages.I would say a 'must see' for tourists and Londoners alike.",Awesome Experience That Was Not Expecting
"October 26, 2017",We are not Art experts nor do we usually go out of our way to visit Art Museums anywhere. We were wandering the area and noticed it was still open (Friday night I believe). So we stumbled on in and then didn't want to leave. Very impressive displays and paintings by renowned artists. Awesome building and free to get in. Now that I have seen it I will make a point to visit more Art Museums while I continue to travel the globe. It is worth the time to drop in and enjoy this fine Gallery. ,Fabulous place !
"October 13, 2017","We have visited the National Gallery many times but there is so much to see that every visit is like the first time and new.This gallery has a fabulous selection of works from the greatest artists who have ever lived . If you love art a visit is a must.This visit was to see a specific exhibition ... Van Eyck and the Pre Raphaelites which was a wonderful exhibition bringing home to me some of the ideas that helped form the apes Raphaelite movement .This gallery is a place to wander, browse and marvel.What is more, it is free.",A chance to see some national treasures for free!!
"October 10, 2017","We only spent hour or so in the National gallery before heading off for a West End show. I've often visited in the past, but had forgotten just how many famous paintings are on display, including works by Monet, Renoir, Constable, Van Gogh and Stubbs. Bearing in mind that there is no compulsory charge, this is a great way to pass some quality time in London.",The national gallery
"March 11, 2018",An excellent collection of impressionist and post impressionist art as well as international art that is done by the masters of their kind. An excellent collection which failed to disappoint. Expect to spend a full day here and don't hesitate because it is well worth it.,Heaven for art lovers
"March 7, 2018","Sitting at the top end of the Trafalgar Square, National Gallery is a grand, elegant and massive art gallery. National Gallery was formed in 1824 and it started when the British Government bought 38 paintings from an insurance broker. Today it houses of 2,300 paintings dated from 13th century to 20th century. Two third of the collections are from private donations. I came here on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't very busy. I had made a list of paintings which I wanted to see and with the help of an audio guide (£5), it made my visit absolutely rewarding. My most favourite artist is Canaletto due to my love of Venice, but National Gallery also displays many famous artists' paintings such as from John Constable, Joseph Turner, Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, Claude, Rembrandt, Michelangeio, Titian and Leonardo da Vinci...etc. All paintings are displayed on one floor but it was spread over 60 rooms and it is huge. I spent 4 hours at the gallery and still didn't feel enough. National Gallery houses one of the best collections of paintings in the world and it is free. This is a MUST visit gallery if you fancy art and paintings. Highly recommended!Tips: i) The information leaflet that comes with the audio is awful. Its map is unclear and the whole thing is in black and white. Spend £2 & get a proper map if you can afford it.ii) Avoid the National Cafe inside the gallery. It's a tourist trap and is overpriced, even its signature dish (i.e. cakes/ scones) is well below average. There are many good cafes at Leicester Square and Covent Garden so don't waste your money here.iii) There are few electric sockets at the Central Hall (level 2) which can be used to recharge your mobile's battery.",a proper place to find your soul
"March 5, 2018",leave plenty of time and step back in history this is a visit where you need to browse and take in all the generations. We wont have the late centuries ever captured like this again and its a lovely place to visit with knowledgeable staff and a timeless visit.BC,Love this museum
"March 3, 2018","Amazing, and so interesting And it’s free!!! But please donate , (so it will always be there) I could walk and view for days here .  Plan at least 3 hours to see some of it.Lovely.",Awesome exhibits
"February 21, 2018",This is a wonderful museum to spend an hour or so in while soaking up some English culture. Amazing that museums like this are free. Very educational and pleasing.,A Must See in London
"February 17, 2018","We only had six hours in London and didn't have a plan for the day we were just going to see were we ended up. The rain was pouring down and we were freezing as we found our way to Trafalgar Square, so we decided to pop in here to get out of the cold. Its free to enter, but donations are welcome. There are guided tours if you have the time, unfortunately for our party we only spent an hour here, but we will definitely be back. Its great to see budding artists sitting copying the masterpieces. With limited time we decided there was one painting we had to see before we left, Van Gogh's Sunflowers. It was easy to find as there was a big crowd gathered around it. All in all too short a visit.",First Visit to the National Gallery
"February 15, 2018","My husband and I visited the National Gallery for the first time a few days ago. It is free but you are encouraged to make a donation. We both really enjoyed it. It was certainly busy, but not so much that you couldn’t stand and appreciate the amazing artwork on display. We particularly loved seeing work by Degas, Monet, Van Gogh and Cezanne to name a few. We spend around 90 minutes at the Gallery, but we would recommend to stay longer if you can . ",Free entry to incredible art!
"February 12, 2018","The best thing about the National Gallery is the art. The range and the artists on display are quite incredible. The second best thing is that it is FREE! On easy-to-access Trafalgar square, this museum is one of my favourites in London. I particularly love the Impressionists, but their collection of paintings by Turner, Da Vinci and a slew of other famous, and less famous artists are well worth the visit.There is a great coffee shop downstairs where you can relax during, before or after your visit.",Girlie 50th Birthday Celebrations!
"February 2, 2018",Lovely to walk around and while away the hours. As a non artist I found it very interesting and even if you are not into art you have to admire the work there. Well worth a visit.,Interesting but somewhat dull 
"January 28, 2018","The gallery itself is very well kept and thoroughly cleaned. There are a large number of paintings here, though I think that they can only be appreciated by true art buffs. As a possible improvement, I think it could be better if the staff in each of the rooms actively interacted with the public - such as by providing information about the paintings. Other galleries I have been to have been far more interactive and interesting. ",National Gallery
"May 20, 2017","Worth going to see with magnificent architecture within tne building, magnificent columns. Central in location, definately worth a visit",A national treasure to be sure
"May 16, 2017","Yet another free attraction in Central London.  Climbing stairs up from Trafalgar Square leads you into a cultural palace and as with the Portrait Gallery around the corner, you do not need to be especially knowledgeable about either artists or their work to really enjoy a bit to this world class Gallery.  Highly recommended.",A wonderful day out
"May 11, 2017","We went to see the Michelangelo and Sebastiano exhibits and ended staying for most of the day enjoying the magnificent paintings.It just has to be seen to be completely understood. This is a great way to spend a leisurely day in the middle of a vacation; its indoors, easy walking, and there are wonderful cafes to enjoy as well.",National Gallery - National Treasure

"April 30, 2017","I've been here a couple times, and it's always worth a visit while in Trafalgar Square. It does get very very busy and somewhat uncomfortably crowded at times - but that's a given for a free London attraction such as this. They have a great variety of art to suit all tastes. ",Beautiful place with lots of history right at Trafalgar
"April 29, 2017","We have been to London numerous times but this is the first time here. We paid and went into the Michelangelo & Sebastiano Exhibition. Beautiful. Not only did they have the paintings, they had letters written by the masters and the pre-sketches (studies) of some of the paintings. Very interesting to see the before and after as it were. The rest of the gallery was free and well worth the time spent. Two things I loved. Seeing the progression of painting styles through the ages, and actually being able to see in front of me, things I grew up knowing about from books, tv, etc was moving. ","a must go in winter, when it is coolish outside,wonderful history"
"April 12, 2017","having seen most of the major museums in the world, i must be honest, that those in london are slightly palladian, not s strict as in st petersburg where the old russian women sneer at you when ever u go near a pic so unlike the dutch musuems",Stunning
"April 2, 2017","This was my 3rd time in here and i still find it amazing, we've been to lots of the major art galleries around Europe and this is still the best, from Constable to Canaletto, Van Gogh to Titian you could spend hours in here and its free.",Overlooked by me for years
"March 29, 2017",When I was young and even when working in Soho for 28 years I did not appreciate what treasures were on my doorstep and this one of them. I have now made made many visits and spent hours here now I am retired. If you have never been and like me you are learning about art you are in for a treat.,Wow...just wow!
"July 9, 2017","Having lived in London for a number of years, I did not take advantage of this incredible place.  Having moved North, weekend breaks to London have enabled me to do so.  If you like art, this is a must see!  Even if you do not, the building itself is incredible. Add it to your to do list, please",It was okay
"July 1, 2017",For me it was nothing special and London has much better things to do for my time. Part of it was closed when we were there too.,Beautiful Museum
"June 29, 2017",Spectacular Museum in a fantastic location in London with multiple pieces of Art that are not to be missed.,You must do the free tour at the National Gallery
"June 25, 2017","I go the audio tour which was great. But the highlight was the free guided tour - amazing!! I don't know my guide's name but I thought he was fabulous - he was not pretentious at all and was such a great interactive speaker. He chose three works of art and spent @ 20 minutes on each one with fascinating stories -- it was one of the best parts of my trip - I just loved it. I believe the tour leaves twice a day from one of the lobbies - one in the morning, and one in the afternoon. Please do make time for it and you won't regret it. ",A real treasure house
"June 21, 2017","Apart from wonderful galleries full of masterpieces and splendid exhibitions it has mosaics by Boris Anrep on the main staircase, from 1923 to the 1950s this remarkable Russian artist had many commissions for private houses and Westminster Cathedral.

"May 31, 2017","The widest collection of paintings and sculpture of 17th and 18th century, opposite Trafalgar Square. I f you are an art lover, this place is not to be missed.",The clue is in the title 'Beyond' Caravaggio!!!
"January 2, 2017","I usually very much enjoy National Gallery exhibitions - we are members and visit often. However the current Caravaggio exhibition is a disgrace in my view. You cannot market such an exhibition with only 6 pictures by the named artist!! It's not that the others are not good, they are, especially the Riberas but it's really shocking that so much is made of the influence of Caravaggio with so few examples. Come on NG, you're taking the pxxx!!Spend your money instead in the small 'jewel ' of the exhibition that is the Australian Impressionists - an eye opening feast for the eyes!!",great way to pass the time
"December 29, 2016","We did a tour of the gallery , great works of European art. The range was beautiful and well presented, well documented. More in depth with an audio tour. The symbolism in the artwork is astounding.",Excellent Museum With Some of the Most Famous Paintings in the World
"December 26, 2016","This is an excellent art museum in the heart of London. It's a great spot if you don't have a ton of time in London because you can also check off Trafalgar Square and the National Portrait Gallery. I adored the National Gallery. Amazingly it's free to get in! You don't see that much these days. It can be crowded so be prepared for the crowds (or go early).There are a LOT of important paintings including Van Gogh's ""Sunflowers,"" and works by Jan van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Hans Holbein, J. M. W. Turner, and many many more. I highly recommend it.",Beautiful Place
"December 17, 2016","Amazing place that I've been visited! I loved the structure of the building and the amazing view, I'll visit that place again for sure. Next year I'm planning to visit that place again. Love Love Love ",More Caravaggio please
"November 26, 2016","I visited the current exhibtion centring on the work and influence of Caravaggio. The exhibition was well laid out and well presented. However, it would have been strengthened by more works by Caravaggio himself. The two key exhibits, beautifully set out side-by-side already belong to the National Gallery. I am London-based, but I wonder if someone travelling to the city specifically for this event would have felt it was rather slight, or light on major works. It compares poorly with some of the great exhibitions such as the Leonardo da Vinci  and the Rembrandt which the Gallery has achieved in recent times","Great art, centrally locsted"
"November 25, 2016",The national gallery is at a prime location of the Trafalgar Square. The gallery is huge and has lot of different variety of art from basic abstract to mixtures. The building is great and the guide program for the gallery is very useful and give an great idea of all the art displayed in the Gallery ,A Must See
"November 22, 2016","The National Gallery is among some of the best galleries in Europe.  We went on a Friday evening and definitely less crowded.  There were a lot to see and we saw about 75% of the paintings.  By the end, we were exhausted.  Next time I'm in London, would definitely go again.",Carravagio & Beyond exhibit was wonderful
"November 15, 2016","Excellent special exhibit.  But the overall Gallery is wonderful!  We had the opportunity to take a one hour guided tour through some of the highlights, and the docent was outstanding!",Audio guide- a must
"November 14, 2016",What could you ask more for the excellent collections of free gallery!Visited 3 times and all of them were excellent.Please indulge yourself with the audio guide; would worth every penny and a must.,"Great art, up close - make time for a visit"
"November 10, 2016","National Gallery should be on the top of anyone's list. I have been to London several times, but I always make time for a visit to Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery.Over 2300 images to view including  iconic masterpieces by Cezanne, Monet, Seurat, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, and too many others to mention. Pick up a museum map, and if you have the time to spend, a portable Audio Guide with commentaries on more than 1,000 of the paintings.",The Delacroix Exhibition
"May 24, 2016","I've been to the National Gallery many times and it's always a pleasure, with superb exhibitions of masters like Rembrandt, Goya and Delacroix.  One thing that lets the gallery down a bit is the catering, which is over priced and of mediocre quality. For this reason it gets only four stars.",Get an online guide or tour guide (free) or audio tour (cheap) to make sense of it
"May 19, 2016","Unless you are an art major, this place is so vast that it's better to bite a small piece off. there are free tour guides which last an hour but you are part of a crowd, audio guides for a few pounds but not as ""inspirational"" or even outrageously expensive personal guides. If you just want to zoom through to recognize iconic artists and prices that works too, but you'll miss the intellectual and technical mastery that makes these carefully chosen pieces so special. What you'll learn here can be applied to the artists other great pieces you'll find in Paris, Zurich, New York, Chicago etc...consider this more as an intense two hour learning of why Europe evolved, where it found and lost its way, why humans are insanely complicated and have vision average mortals can only gawk at. Don't let the crowds bother you, the selfies are everywhere now and not worth getting wound up about. Be in the presence of greatness, prepare the day before by getting that online app or rent the audio tour. Your head won't fit into its old hat sizes afterwards, and you'll be a more generous, wise and observational person afterwards.",Went for a walk back in history
"April 25, 2016","Each room in this castle of art contains some of the most famous works of each historical period.  Entrance was free at the time that my whole family entered, all 5 of us.  While you are there refresh yourself at a tea table with some cakes and scones.  Bon.",Samples the masters
"April 24, 2016","Although this museum is not nearly as famous as the Prado or the Louvre, it is no slouch.  There are amazing representations of all the masters here and great temporary exhibits as well.  Leave plenty of time as there is so much to see.  ",a must-see
"April 18, 2016","I stopped in here on impulse, not having included it in my list of ""priority sightseeing,"" and even as a very casual art fan I was floored. the place is beautiful and has some incredible pieces, many of which you'll recognize from your history textbooks. (it was cool for me to see familiar names like rembrandt, caravaggio, monet -- art is not something I know a lot about, so the subtleties and nuances of what defines 'good art' or museum-worthy art is often lost on me. but even i can appreciate certain artists and pieces that I know made a big impact on art history).it's overwhelming, though. I wandered around for over two hours and I don't think I saw half of what there is to see. if there are specific things you want to see, the official website has a map/guide that you can look at to figure out which area of the museum to check out first, depending on what period of history you're most interested in. this was a great way to spend an afternoon and i'd highly recommend the experience to anyone.",My favourite museum in London
"April 17, 2016","This is a superb museum. I always go here when I'm in London - my favourite painting ""The Arnolfini wedding"" by Jan van Eyck has a special place in my heart. Another absolute gem is the series of painings called ""Mariage à-la-mode"" by William Hogarth.",Fantastic
"April 5, 2016","More than 1300 paintings and for free! Great, great, great.I recommend the audio guide. I've used the guide for the most important 80 paintings and spent there about 3.5 hours. My 10 years old kid loved also.A must to see!",Worth visiting!
"March 31, 2016",We went on Good Friday. We really enjoyed it! The place is huge so bare this in mind when visiting. We were quite tired after spending time looking and reading about each picture then realised how huge the place was. Was a really fun day out free too. Well worth visiting!,One can enjoy some lovely time here.
"March 31, 2016",It is located centrally and one can acccess easily by underground or any other means of public transport. ,Not the NATIONAL Gallery for nothing!
"March 31, 2016","I never cease to be amazed, nay impressed, by the sheer variety and volume of exhibits in this world-class museum, perhaps best known for, but not limited to, its paintings. There is no excuse not to pop in, at least; after all, its location on Trafalgar Square could not be more central - and its permanent location can be viewed free of charge!",A 'must see' for any art lover.
"June 5, 2016",My title explains it all.  I visit art museums often.  There is so much to enjoy here that I feel unqualified to comment.  Take some time to wander through slowly and drink it in.,Free but confusing
"June 5, 2016","Like most London museums and art galleries, the National Gallery is free, which is quite a bonus. However, I found its layout extraordinarily confusing, with a jumble of rooms with multiple interconnections and no obvious route to follow. The maps were of limited assistance. They could learn a lot from other major galleries in how to assist visitors to view what is an extensive collection - probably too extensive in terms of overall quality.",Beautiful setting
"May 28, 2016","While I am not an art connoisseur, I did enjoy this stop.  Thought it was cool that it was right in the heart of Trafalgar Square, but did find it somewhat confusing inside the building.  The art was amazing and thought it was great that it was free to the public.",Wonderful and free
"May 27, 2016",Entrance is free and the place is always busy. I like the gift shops. The exhibitions are also very nice (I came specifically to see the George Shaw exhibition). Overall I'd recommend to anyone who loves art.,Incredible
"May 27, 2016","The selection of paintings in this gallery is absolutely fantastic. You cannot miss this gallery, especially when the entrance is free to the public.If you are a lover of art especially paintings from the Renaissance movement then this is the place for you.","If you are into art galleries, this is awesome."
"May 27, 2016","We breezed through the gallery rather quickly.We honestly aren't into standing, staring at art, but we did enjoy seeing the paintings divided into time periods.It was pretty obvious how the styles stayed the same through different periods.","If you can, ALWAYS visit this room"
"May 26, 2016","Sometimes you don't go into the National Gallery because you think ""I don't have the time to see it all"". My recommendation, instead, is for you to do what I always do: Go In, visit ONE room each time, look at it properly! Ideally, you can do this for just one painting!! If you want to see my favourite room, turn right at the top of the stairs and go to the end room, you'll find what is in my picture here (Stubbs) but you can also admire, on your way, Canaletto and Bellotto and Turner....",Wonderful collectoin...something for everybody's taste.
"May 26, 2016",Very nice and quite extensive collection. This was out first visit and we were impressed by the scope of the collection and periods represented. We went for the Delacroix installation but also spent a few hours in the permanent collection and dining spaces. The Delacroix collection was breathtaking.,Paintings of the highest order in abundance.
"May 25, 2016","A museum that will satisfy any art lover and more!  Beautifully laid out, with display halls that are architectural masterpieces in themselves.   I was moved to tears when I encountered a famous Van Eyck painting  I had studied while in college, nearly a half century ago- The Arnolfini Wedding.   It had many other admirers crowding around the little canvas.     Once again, admission is free, so you can't go wrong!   A must see.","One of the world's most important collections, great temporary exhibitions."
"May 25, 2016","I rarely fail to visit when in London, outstanding temporary exhibitions, some of the world's most imporatnt art works.",GOYA - The Portraits
"December 19, 2015","There is only one word to describe the exhibition of the Goya's portraits: Superlative! It is a jewel of an exhibition. We went around it three times, with a renewed sense of wonder at the ability of Goya to bring his subjects to life. The National Gallery is a tremendous place: it has a wealth of art requiring more than one day (a week?) for full appreciation, but even a short visit such as ours can transport the visitor into another world, where beauty reigns supreme.",One of the world's greatest museums
"December 18, 2015","We had not been to London for eleven years, and although I was looking forward to a return visit to the National Gallery, I had forgotten how  extraordinary its collection  is. It's one of those museums that resists a hit-and-run visit and insists that you give it the time it deserves. I was there three times in ten days (my wife balked at the third visit) and felt I could easily spend just as much time again. Like the National Gallery in Washington and many other great London museums, it doesn't charge admission  (except for special exhibitions). An amazing gift to the public.",Travelled from Australia to see the Goya Exhibition 
"December 16, 2015","This exhibition is coming to a close but if you can, do see it. I travelled from Australia to do so, and wasn't disappointed. I booked my tickets on line, and got there first thing. The self guided Audio tour was instructive without being patronising. The paintings themselves are stupendous and many only seen for the first time. I also went for a walk through some of the other galleries to see some ""old friends"" and this part of the Gallery, which is free, is well worth making part of your London experience. You won't be disappointed. ","Goya: The Portraits, extraordinary people seen through Goya's eyes"
"December 13, 2015","Goya The Portraits: must-see National Gallery exhibition. For the first time, the Portraits exhibition tells the story of Goya’s career as a portrait painter. The exhibition explores a selection of the extraordinary people whose images reveal Goya’s technical, stylistic, and psychological development. From Goya’s first portrait masterpiece, showing the Infante Don Luis de Borbón family (the young brother of King Charles III of Spain) to more intimate depictions of family and friends. Don't miss this unique exhibition.",From old Masters to Modernist painters
"December 11, 2015","The Gallery has a mind-blowing of art such as works by Botticelli and Bronzino, Caravaggio and Cezanne, Degas and Delaroche,  Rembrandt and Rubins, Gougan and Gaudi, Hogarth and Holbein, Michelangelo to Monet, Stubbs and Seurat, Titan to Turner, Velazquez and Vermeer. Entrance is free though it is beneficial to support the gallery by leaving a small donation. The gallery is expansive and its a good idea to be selective if  you are limited in time, so get on line and plan what works you want to see. Its also a great place just to wander and see what you come across that tickles your fancy. The Gallery also has an expansive bookshop.  ",Amazing
"December 6, 2015","Stuck for something to do on a rainy afternoon in London? Visit the National Gallery.Free to enter, full of beautiful art, spacious, a place to leave your luggage, it's awesome! Even if you're not an art lover there is loads of fascinating stuff to see. You can pop in for one hour or six. Get the head phones for £4 and learn about different pictures, then go and have a drink or mooch round the shops, smug in your cultural immersion!",Cultural Tourism 
"December 6, 2015","I love to visit here, there are amazing Art from different artists which take us to analyze each particular painting as a far away magic trip.Among the many wonderful works on display, the following tables are:""The Virgin of the Rocks"" by Leonardo da Vinci; ""The Entombment"" by Michelangelo; ""Venus and Mars"" by Botticelli; ""The Supper at Emmaus"" by Caravaggio, ""Self Portrait at the Age of 34"" by Rembrandt; ""The Young woman standing the Virgin"" by Vermeer; ""Sunflowers"" Van Gogh; ""The toilet of Venus"" by Velázquez; ""Bathers"" by Paul Cezanne, and ""Bathers at La Grenouillère"" Monet.Be sure to also know some works of British artists, such as ""The Fighting Temeraire"" of JMW Turner; ""The Hay Wain"" John Constable, and the beautiful horse ""The Whistlejacket"" George Stubbs.Contrary to what most people think, the collection of the National Gallery never belonged to the British royal family, was acquired in its entirety with resources of the British people, isn't that amazing?",So many things to see
"December 2, 2015","I've been back several times, and there's always so much to take in. I love seeing my favorite painters' works in person. ",Audio guide a must 
"November 23, 2015",It was free to visit. So as a tourist it was good to spend some time and soak up some culture. But if you are not all that interested in arts in general it gets boring. So an audio guide ($4) is a must.,Almost overwhelming
"November 21, 2015","As expected, Britain's National Gallery is a treasure trove of great paintings in a spectacular building.  A not to be missed attraction,",Fantastic Gallery
"October 15, 2015",All you need to see and more. The museum is free so you can come and go without spending several hours at one time.,Must-see but prepare the crowds
"October 15, 2015","It's worth a visit.  Free admission and voluntary donation. Located at Trafalgar Square.  Easy accessible by underground and bus. Houses an amazing collection of the paintings.  Great exhibits but extremely crowded and noisy. I could not possibly have seen all the paintings and was so bothered by noise. I wish I could enjoy the arts with less crowds, creating better experience.  Maybe next time.","Goya, the man and his paintings"
"October 14, 2015","Before the exhibition, I did not know very much about Goya and his pictures, usually French and Italian paintings/artists were what interested me but Goya's works were wonderful. The guide book given is very helpful but do not miss out on having the audio guide.  Not only was there information regarding the pictures, life and times Goya lived through but further information on the costumes and fashions of the period. The exhibition was organised wonderfully, and I won't forget those pictures. A great collection of pictures and now I feel that I ""know"" Goya.",An amazing collection
"October 9, 2015","Na incredible collection, no doubt. I don´t really enjoy medieval paintings and their catholic themes, but even putting all that aside there´s still a marvelous collection of art. Don´t miss some of the most famous Van Gogh paintings display here.",A great art collection in pleasant setting
"October 4, 2015","The best thing about the National Gallery is its location - bang on the Trafalgar Square. The collection is remarkable - some of the paintings I recall are Leonardo's Virgin of the Rock, Van Gogh's Sunflowers and some iconic ones of Constable and Turner. One could easily spend a full day admiring the art. We also had one of the best cups of Darjeeling tea in the dining room.",Small but mighty
"September 28, 2015","What a lovely museum!  I look for Impressionists everywhere I go, so I was very happy to spend some quality time with some of the masters.  I am using a cane in prep for knee surgery and was very happy there was seating from which to enjoy the art.  Also appreciated elevators!  We had a pleasant lunch in the cafe.  And, if I recall correctly, the museum was free!",Nice London Interlude
"September 25, 2015",Enjoyable respite from the London fray especially on a rainy day.  Nice eclectic collection of master's paintings including a nice display of impressionists paintings...a crowd favorite.  Free admission in a beautiful historic building right on Trafalgar square.  Great cafeteria on the ground floor as well with delicious treats of all kinds.,Excellent Art Museum
"September 25, 2015",Excellent collection of paintings and the only downer we experienced was some of the rooms which held items we wanted to see were closed. The organization is superb and the interior of the building is beautiful. The site is free which is amazing considering just how good it is. A don't miss.,Excellent Art Collection
"September 24, 2015","Wonderful paintings of Monet, Van Gogh, William Turner, etc. The museum has had issues with worker strikes and not all of it is open but luckily the paintings I wanted to see were available.  It's a beautiful museum worth the effort to see it.",Fantastic art collection & no entrance fee!
"September 24, 2015","I first went to the National Gallery in 1987, and was thoroughly impressed with the Gallery and it's collection. Since my first visit, I have returned probably half a dozen times and still feel that I haven't seen everything. The building is beautiful and the artwork is displayed in the best possible way. It's hard to believe that the National Gallery doesn't charge an entrance fee, so with the rising ticket costs for attractions in London, there is absolutely no excuse for missing this one!",Good experience at a world class art museum
"August 1, 2015",World class art museum has what you expect. Vast galleries of masterful art. We ducked in and out of different rooms and let our eyes be drawn to particular pieces from various eras. We thoroughly enjoyed the layout and ease we could browse even though it was pouring rain outside meaning many tourists were seeking indoor activities for the day. ,Lovely
"August 1, 2015","First you stop outside at Trafalgar Square, let the kids climb or look at the giant lions, then walk up the steps to the National Gallery.  It's free and filled with amazing art. Donations are welcome. A one pound donation gets you a map of the place in your language showing where to find a few of the famous artists and their paintings. The art is  separated by time period. I'm not that great at reading maps but even I could figure out where to go to find the art pieces I wanted to see - Van Gogh, Monet, Reuben, Rembrandt. The gallery wasn't over crowded and you could actually stand and just stare at your favorite pieces. Amazingly they even let you take pictures of the art. We had a great time. Even the 13 year old found a time period of art that she loved.",Great art museum
"July 30, 2015","Some of the best works of some of the world's most notable masters.  Has a couple of Titian's works, my personal fav!",For Art Lovers of the Past

"July 26, 2015","For all those of us who love art this museum is a must. Being centrally located in a grandiose building in London, having no entrance fee and having paintings of some of the most famous painters in history this museum is an absolute gem. Entering the museum I had a small backpack which was searched but I could wear it throughout my visit which was nice as I had my guidebook there.",Soundscapes
"July 25, 2015",This is an exhibition at the National Gallery that runs Sept. 6th. The slogan for the exhibit is see the sound and hear the painting.  Sound artists were selected to compose music representing their preferred painting. A unique sensory experience. ,Wonderful Visit - Wonderful Displays
"July 24, 2015",This is one of this enlaces that you can keep returning to time after time after time and never get tired of it.

"July 22, 2015","The museum has many major masterpieces, including the da Vinci, Virgin of the Rocks (another Virgin is in the Louvre) and that painting alone is worth the visit... there are only about 14 da Vinci's in the world. You can spend hours here so a bit of a plan is a good idea. Make certain you the see the Van Gogh, the several Titians and Raphaels. And don't bypass the Caravaggio and the Vermeers. Great collection. And, like all national museums in London, there is no entrance fee.",Jaw dropped
"June 1, 2015","How can the English make it free while lots of museum out there in the Europe mainland charge us a fine-dining meal to see some trash they stored?

"May 22, 2015","I base a lot of travel decisions on where I can find spectacular art. You go to New York for MOMA. You go to Florence for The Uffizi. You go to London for The National Gallery.My husband and I recently spent a week in London, and spent the better part of a day in the National Gallery. We got there shortly after they opened, picked up a guide (it’s only £1), then set off into the galleries. You’ll definitely need the guide. This is a huge museum and it’s easy to get lost. We saw an enormous amount of art that even those with a casual interest would recognize. Leonardo, Raphael, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Titian, Caravaggio, Rubens, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Turner, Constable, Cezanne, Monet, Van Gogh … and so much more.The real thrill was to see these works on a wall (not in a book) and get a true sense of the scale of these masterpieces. We took our time wandering through, broke for lunch at the National Dining Room, finished up the rest of the galleries, had a caffeine injection at the Espresso Bar, did some shopping for souvenirs, and finally left around 4:00! It was an all-day affair!And I loved it and wouldn’t trade that day for anything in the world.If you are an art-lover, you need to visit.",The attendants could develop their people skills more!
"May 22, 2015","I visited with a friend who is a collections manager for the National Trust in a house that houses a considerable art collection from a former chairman of the National Gallery (I am a volunteer at that house too). Whilst observing a painting that was glazed, I pointed at a feature and the attendant came up behind me and shouted ""Don't point you may touch the painting"". He could have made me jump and therefore accidently touched it (we weren't that close thankfully). She commented that if I, as a volunteer, had spoken to a visitor like that, she would have remonstrated with me. How about, ""Isn't it a lovely painting, but careful Madam, you don't want to set off all the bells and whistles""? Its not what you say but how you say it!",Must visit it if you go to London

"March 21, 2015","Even after many years of visiting the National Gallery, I still make a point to stop in every time I`m in London.  A beautiful building that houses incredible paintings that sits on Trafagar Square.  Yes, the crowds can be maddening at times but I`ve found that the trick is to slow down.  Give yourself enough time to see the pieces or periods or styles that interest you the most.  Sit for a bit and let those who are busy capturing the moment take their pics and move on.  Oddly enough, it is an ideal place to decompress in the midst of hoards of people passing by the magnificent displays.  Enjoy!",Amazing London
"March 20, 2015","A beautiful museum with many beautiful works makes the British National Gallery a great visit for both local and tourist alike. I had about an hour and a half to squeeze in a visit to the museum so I definitely had to plan what works of art I wanted to see. They had a few Caravaggio so I made a dash to see those (wonderful as always) and then I made my way over to the Rembrandt and then the Monet section. All stunning and very worthy of anybody's time. The museum itself was gorgeous and the staff there were very helpful and also very knowledgeable.Other big pros about the National Gallery: it is free, it is accessible by just about any form of public transport, and it is in a great location of London--close to many other attractions (such as Buckingham palace).",not to be missed

Everyone who was in the room stopped to listen to the explanation of the guide. Kids were thrilled.",The impressionists
"March 18, 2015",Very interesting and enlightening exhibision paintings collected from all over the world  great chance to see them all together,FANTASTIC
"April 22, 2015","- One of the best collections of art in the World. Paintings from 1300 to 1900 are all there.  It is very difficult to see the entire collection in one or two visits. (may be the high-lights can be seen/ the brochure has the highlights with room numbers ).The interiors of the gallery itself is a place to see and enjoy. -One single place to see many Masters, Countries , impressionists et al. If you like art/paintings, you will be stunned to see the collection and this gallery  should never be missed at all ,if you are in London.. (I have seen a number of paintings many times.) - Entrance fee to this glorious  collection is FREE too.!! .  - Pl hire a audio guide; It will be very useful to enjoy the paintings. (a few times I have viewed paintings without the audio guide, I feel lost)  Let me share something. I have been visiting this Gallery from 1987!!  (until now, about 50 times plus, all more than 4 hrs ) latest visit being April 2015. (will be visiting again a few times in July and August '15.)",Inventing Impressionism--Go!
"April 20, 2015","The National Gallery is stupendous, even without seeing this special exhibition.  But as long as you're there, do see this show.  We are off to Paris next, and as we viewed this show we realized that some of the paintings we would have looked for at the D'Orsay and Louvre are HERE.  The paintings gathered together in one spot represent the finest art of the Impressionists.  The curators produced a booklet that comes with the price of admission that allows guests to browse through the galleries at an unhurried pace, reading about each painting without having to peer at wall plaques (which often blocks the view of others).  The colors, the textures, the vibrancy, the inspiration--it all comes through beautifully.  Despite the timed entry, the rooms are crowded,  Don't feel you need to see the paintings in order--just watch for openings at each painting and move in that direction.  You will be rewarded with a good look at some of the best art in the world. ",Van Gogh and Monet!
"April 20, 2015","Spectacular Van Gogh's Sunflowers, Monet's Waterlillies, Seurat's Bathers. There were quite a few rooms closed. It was strange. But still worth the visit!","Fabulous art, for free!"
"April 19, 2015","This museum is amazing.  Not only is it full lf fabulous art, but it is free to enter.  It is very well organized by centuries, which is helpful due to the vast spaciousness and amount of rooms of art that they contain.  Be sure to grab a map/guide upon entering.  Since it is free, it can be very crowded, especially with tour groups and school trips.",Amazing
"April 18, 2015","A must-see place. Impressive art collection. If you like art, reserve at least 3 hours to see the museum, and some good minutes to sit somewhere at Trafalgar Square enjoyng the London living.",Awesome
"April 16, 2015","The national gallery is one the atracción y London, the location, the arquitechture, and of course the art is one if not of the best in London","One of the best in the world, has to be!"
"April 11, 2015","Great master pieces free for all, extremely well kept, really worth the time. Need minimum 3 hours, I think! Would hold it personally at the same level as the Tate modern! Do visit, if around trafalgar, if if you are not a fan of history and art!",Simply Art
"April 9, 2015","You should visit national gallery and the chance to watch amazing paintings for free in Trafalgar square, a must!!!",Great collection of materpieces
"April 9, 2015","There is so much to see at the National Gallery.  You could easily spend the whole day here. Highlights include Sunflowers by Van Gogh, and Virgin and Child by da Vinci.",You need a day
"April 8, 2015","Good thing the weather was lousy, we spent 3 hours in the National Gallery, you need a lot more time than that to see it all properly. The collections are so rich and every important artist and time period is covered by a number of fine works, I need to go back.",Amazing art!
"February 27, 2015","We came here for a couple of days, there's so much to take in and all of it is amazing, some even more so.History all around you. Amazing!You really should come  here, if only to look around.Enjoy!",Marvellous place
"February 27, 2015",Great place to have a short visit - or spend the whole day. Great paintings in many rooms. Take the Sackler room 34 - and sit down like Bond did;),Escape the rain or cold and see great paintings
"February 24, 2015",There are so many well-known paintings here that you are bound to recognise something. I used to work nearby and had many favourites that I would visit during my lunch hours. The attendants are very knowledgeable and most would probably appreciate a little chat to pass the time.Be aware that toilet queues can be very long on busy days (better to pop into a nearby pub).,Cold coffee
"February 22, 2015","My wife and I used the cafeteria in the National Gallery and after waiting for some time, two cold cups of coffee arrived. We informed the server and she took them away and brought back what we thought were two fresh cups about three minutes later which were only marginally warmer than the first two. When we added milk (which had been passed over from the next table that had just been vacated) the coffee was then colder than the first two cups. The bill had a 12.5% service charge added to it and a note in small print that it was a voluntary payment. We chose not to pay it but as a sizable number of their visitors are overseas tourists, they probably coughed up. My advice would be to bring your own refreshments if visiting the National Gallery.",Filled with History
"February 20, 2015","What I love most about the national gallery is its size. It isn't enormous like the Louvre so that someone like me who goes to galleries to see specific paintings can enter and exit without walking a half marathon by the time I exit. The layout of the rooms is easily navigable. I visited on a Sunday afternoon and while there were crowds, I entered with my niece (children are issued a free children's audioguide w/ purchase of an adult guide) and we saw what we came to see and were in and out in 1 hour. The biggest crowd was within the Dutch room, next to Van Gogh's paintings. We waited until the lull in the crowd appeared to re-enter the room and see his work. Don't miss the Turner paintings in room 34, as well as the Caravaggio in room 32. There are free workshops for children on Sundays at 11am and 2pm.",National Treasure
"February 19, 2015","Situated on the north side of Trafalgar Square this is truly a ""national"" treasure art works by world famous artists abound in the various galleries. This should be a must see location for all travellers to London but make sure to leave enough time to truly enjoy the wonders on show.",Better than anticipated
"February 18, 2015","What a way to spend the day!  And it didn't seem like enough time, at that.  Maybe we were fortunate that it was less busy than expected, but the layout of the rooms and the sheer volume of magnificent art left us feeling as if we were taking a private tour.",One of the world's best.
"February 13, 2015",What can I say?  These paintings are the ones featured in every art appreciation course you ever took.  And it is free!,Enjoyable
"February 9, 2015","The National Gallery is a must see. if your time is limited you can take an organised tour led by gallery lecturers which take about 1 hour. These tours visit some of the art works giving an overall view of the collection. If you do have the time for a lengthy visit it is well worth it  You can do an audio tour through the gallery and they cater for a number of languages. There is lift access, toilet facilities, food venues and a shop.   ",Amazing visionary experience.
"February 8, 2015","I visited National Gallery with a friend, I expected a great experience & didn't disappoint, it has over two thousand paintings & some of the most famous artwork worldwide, including Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers, Leonardo da Vinci's The Virgin of the Rocks, Caravaggio's a Boy bitten by a lizard, John Constable's The Cornfield, Claude Monet's Snow at Argenteuil, Pierre-Auguste Renoir's The Umbrellas & many many more. It's a must for all Art Lovers, it's an amazing experience. I felt honoured to see such visionary  breathtaking artwork, and a major part of history. ",Beauty and quiet !
"March 18, 2015","Most beautiful collections ever in great surroundings, enjoying peace and quiet in the middle of noisy London! Also great for a cup of coffee enjoying some more views in the confort of an armchair in a nice coffee shop which provides good rest before resuming your tour of the Gallery. Fantastic atmosphere ! Loved my visit ! ",Most of the rooms were closed due to industrial action
"March 17, 2015","Hardly any of the rooms were open we never saw any of the great masterpieces and we were only informed of this once we had entered! It wasn't mentioned on the web site, very disappointed.",Not to be missed!
"March 15, 2015","We downloaded a list of 30 ""must see"" items in advance and had the information desk help us plot our course. With 4 kids, teens and 9, it was a great scavenger hunt style visit that kept us running and enjoying the museum for almost two hours. The ones who had to be coaxed in ended up slowing down to see extra items that interested them along the way. ",A must visit
"March 14, 2015","We went to National Gallery again today because my daughter loves art. It was amazing as always. However, we didn't expect some rooms were closed due to the industrial strike. In the future we would better check the news via their Twitter or Facebook before we go. ",Art art art
"March 13, 2015",We went with my family.my husband and 2 dougters .we loved it.everybody must see this gallery.even if you dont interest art no matter.Every piece is wonderful.and They are very lucky generation who are living in London.National gallery staff are kind and helpful.shop is allso vey nice you can find what you want as a memeory...,Inventing impressionism

"March 12, 2015","Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Raphael, and a ton of Dutch Masters - they are all here. The art here is important to see, as Sunflowers, Venus and Mars and many other paintings are in the museum. The collection is made up almost exclusively of paintings, but they do not disappoint. A must-see in London. ","great paintings, great building,great experience!"
"March 11, 2015","It is a truly impressive building, and the paintings are a big plus. You can select different tours to do with your audio guide and learn so much about the paintings! A great deal of religious paintings, but also Monet, Van Gogh, even Boticelli. Everyone who loves classic art should go!",Awesome
"February 28, 2015","How can anyone not be impressed with such a lovely venue, to walk around and see all those beautiful paintings....and it's FREE!!",amazing
"February 28, 2015","You can actually see wonderful creations of artist from different era. Try the Dutch room elusion,beautiful artwork. Places like the national gallery helps generation to know more about culture, religion and artist techniques.",Bit of a letdown...
"February 8, 2015","In the interest of full disclosure, we visited the National Gallery AFTER visiting the Vatican Museum and the Borghese Gallery in Rome.  Otherwise, I may have rated this much higher.  If you are visiting London, you should definitely include this on the itinerary.  Entrance to the museum is free (a donation is requested).  The highlights for us:  part of the original frieze from the Parthenon, the Impressionist collection which includes Monet's Japanese Bridge, Pisarro's Montmartre Blvd, Van Gogh's Sunflowers is quite impressive.  Be wary of pickpockets as you approach the museum.  There are many street vendors right in front of the entrance.  It is centrally located right in Trafalgar Square and near good restaurants and the tube.",Don't miss a quick trip to this gallery
"February 7, 2015","Stopped to see Sunflowers by Van Gogh and a few other famous paintings. Second trip to this Gallery. Definitely worth the time. If short of time at Trafalgar Square, ask staff for the key highlights. Coffee shop in basement nice for warming up and taking a break. Gift shop near by. ",Wonderful Art
"February 6, 2015","Rooms and rooms of artwork and it doesn't cost anything; what's not to like? It is also on Trafalgar Square, which is an important landmark.  I particularly liked the 20th Century stuff.",Free Monet
"February 2, 2015","Worth the trip for Monet's ""The Thames Below Westminster"" alone, the National Gallery houses hundreds of classics. The best part - admission is on a donation basis. ",A fantastic collection.
"January 31, 2015",A marvellous gallery and way to pass an hour or two as you marvel at the magnificent works of art on display.Whether you are an expert or simply have the slightest interest in what are some of the most iconic artworks in the world; the works are displayed with great skill and thought whilst being accompanied with a short and interesting explanation of each painting's history/provenance etc,They have Monet's Water Lilies!
"January 26, 2015","It's free and they have some impressive art work. For example, they had Monet, they had many religious works of art, they also had henry Rousseau... ",Always a must in London
"January 19, 2015","A stunning collection, uplifting and extreamly well represented through the different periods and movements throughout history. Conveniently situated centrally in London in a beautiful Neoclassical purpose-built gallery in Trafalgar Square.There is also a good eatery downstairs for refreshments and spending the whole day at the gallery isn't a hardship. The giftshop is well stocked with worthwhile literature and keepsakes.My Fine Art studies have deepened my appreciation for this calibre of art and gallery that I put at the very top of my list of things to do whist in beautiful London. Other galleries worthwhile are Tate Britain and Tate Modern if you appreciate Modern Art. I'm absolutely star struck when I leave these galleries.",Give It A Go
"January 18, 2015","Not a bad gallery some nice paintings once you experience them it's peaceful and calming and u seem to want to ""view them all"" a wonderful experience all year round.",not just a rainy day excursion ... !!
"January 14, 2015",A must see when you are visiting London. It is not possible to describe the amazing selection of world class art ... enough said you should visit more than once to sample the wealth of works and don't forget to make a donation to the upkeep and running of the Gallery.,Within Top 10 galleries in the world
"January 10, 2015","This is one of the museums that are must see and should be on your ""bucket list"". Great collection of paintings and sculptures and all - free of charge. It was my third visit in the last 20 years and every time one may be excited finding masterpieces that you will fall in love with.",Avoid exhibitions - they oversell tickets & pack you in
"November 28, 2014","The National Gallery is one of the most astounding collections in the world and to spend an hour or two here wandering around the galleries is a memorable thing indeed (I live in London and so have done this often). However, I was prompted to write a review based on the most unpleasant experience I had at their Rembrandt show. Although timed tickets there was a huge queue to get in, they sell far too many tickets and going around the show becomes unpleasant. I know these shows are about making money but surely they have to strike a balance and have some intent on giving guests a good experience. One of our foremost art commentators, Richard Brooks in the Sunday Times, said exactly this in a recent article in the ST. Shame on the National for taking our £16 and giving us an unpleasant experience.","Interesting place, takes lots of time"
"November 25, 2014","Art in all form, free entrance, lots of tourists. I was there for a few hours, and I didn't manage to see but a small part of it.",The Rembrandt show at London's National Gallery
"November 16, 2014","This is one of those very rare exhibitions that are truly ""once in a lifetime"" events. This large, comprehensive show of Rembrandt's late work in various media is superb, but the crowds are so heavy that you should (a) purchase tickets in advance and (b) arrange to come at 10am when the gallery opens. The show is wonderfully done, and  have only given 4 stars because the crowds make you work to see the pictures, It's worth the struggle.",Great museum!
"November 9, 2014",It was so neat to be able to go here (for free!) and see so many famous and historical paintings all in one place! They are all artfully displayed and have a short description of each piece. Seeing the Royal Family's portraits was a neat experience too!,Don't miss the unique 'Rembrandt - the later years' exhibition - next opportunity probably not before 2050........
"January 10, 2015","The focus of this exhibition are Rembrandts later years - for his contemporaries, he has peaked. He is yesterday's man. The exhibition shows that in these later years he is actually downright revolutionary, and introduces so much more in sophisticated and diverse techniques, as well as targeting his interest on the oh-so unfashionable real life in all its grubbiness. This sets him apart in history as one of the greatest painters ever. Timed tickets for entry, but noone rushes you through the exhibition. Expect a lot of people. It will be warm. Do hire the audio - I found it extremely insightful, especially when combined with the handout leaflet. You miss this exhibition - you probably don't have a similar opportunity in the next 20 or 30 years.......","Rembrandt, movingt"
"December 31, 2014","The Rembrandt exhibition is stunning and moving. Good audio guide. Although I had seen quite a number of his paintings over the years in this set-up they tell a fresh new story. Loved the thematic approach. Although timed entry, a bit too crowded.",Rembrandt and more...
"December 27, 2014","Wow. What an amazing museum. Although it can be difficult to navigate, you simply cannot beat their extensive collections and amazing location in Trafalgar Square.The Rembrandt exhibition was stunning––but I could have done without the hordes of pushy elderly people. They mean business!",It's free - no excuse not to go.
"December 18, 2014","I've been on school trips to the gallery multiple times, but each visit has been equally enjoyable. Great as part of a day out - there are lots of nice restaurants nearby after you've finished in the gallery. Its best feature is, of course, its price, although many of the paid exhibitions are well worth the small fee charged.",Rembrandt late works exhibition at the National Gallery
"December 14, 2014","The works themselves are wonderful - if you can see them, that is. They need to sort out their streaming - too many people, far too many of whom don't seem to understand gallery etiquette. It is more than annoying when a party of yakking women park themselves right in front of you! Some of the lighting I found weird as well: somehow I wasn't expecting to see reflection off the canvases. Those gripes over it's a must see. Masterly, vibrant, almost impressionist brush work - truly amazing.",Amazing
"December 8, 2014",Took a long overdue visit to the National Gallery and was overwhelmed by the amazing collection. Well worth a visit and don't forget to contribute the recommended £4. Worth every penny to help keep the Gallery going. ,AWESOME
"December 4, 2014",I absolutely love this historical wonder!!! I had never been to London before and this is one place that I am so glad I made room for on our trip :),Disappointing visit to the Rembrandt exhibition
"December 2, 2014","We had booked many weeks before and had travelled down to London especially to see the ""Later Works of Rembrandt"" exhibition. We had timed tickets (as everybody had to have) and arrived on time.Regrettably, whilst the concept of having timed entry is good, the management of the visitors was poor. It was seriously overcrowded. Many of the etchings and drawings are very small and you need to be close to them to appreciate them. This was impossible because people listening to the audio tour just stood immobile in front of the pictures making it almost impossible to see them. It was easier to see some of the larger oil paintings, over the heads of the crowds but we were bitterly disappointed by the experience and left before we had really had a chance to benefit from the exhibition.We understand that the Gallery needs to maximise its revenue and sell as many tickets as possible but it also has to realise that it owes its customers  to provide value for money. The Gallery needs to plan its crowd management better. And, as for those poor souls pushing wheelchairs and being pushed in wheelchairs it must have been a nightmare. ",Late Rembrandts poorly exhibited
"December 2, 2014","Subject matter can't fail to attract interest, but the great paintings are let down by bad lighting.  Lesser galleries have managed better.   Inexcusable !",Only wish we had more time
"November 28, 2014","This is a wonderful museum.  If you are short on time like we were you can ask for the highlights tour.  The headset is free with the London Pass.  Otherwise, it's worth paying for.  I think it was only 3 pounds!",Don't miss the Rembrandt exhibition
"November 9, 2014","My expectations of Rembrandt's Late Works was high, and this exhibition more than exceeded them.  It is glorious!  You would be wise to book ahead and then go slightly late (or early, the attendants are flexible) as on the hour and half hour f timed tickets, there is a queue to get in, and this means that the first few rooms are crowded.  This in no way detracts from the joy of seeing paintings familiar from art books glowing with a life and vigour.  How could such vibrant works have been painted in Rembrandt's later years?Do not miss, if you appreciate art.  Worth every penny of the rather high (£18) entrance fee.Tip:  the descriptions are not alongside the paintings, but in an excellent little booklet.  If anyone you know is going before you, ask them to pick one up for you, so that you can do a little pre-reading.",A must visit place
"November 4, 2014",The Supper at Emmaus by Caravaggio Room 32 and of course the Magdalen Reading by Rogier van der Weyden in Room 56 are worth a visit.,Excellent
"October 30, 2014","It is so amazing to see ""the masters"" work in person, and only a couple feet away.  Loved that I could also take photos, without flash of course.  Also loved that they included Rembrandt paintings that he had not completed.  So interesting to see his process in creating his masterpieces.  Spent over 4 hrs here and loved every minute.",The best place to spend a little extra time
"October 29, 2014","This is every visual feast in one place.  Rather than doing it in a go, we spent about 20 minutes every morning here.  It is the only way to not get overwhelmed by the place.",Great Museum
"October 24, 2014",A must see on during your stay in London. The early modern wing has some of the great Renaissance artists I enjoyed very much!,Very busy
"October 21, 2014",The National Gallery was VERY busy when I visited. It's hard to enjoy the art when you have to battle with tourists to be able to see anything. This isn't helped by the gallery's maze-like layout. The actual collection is impressive and admittedly a 'must see' but I think I enjoyed my time more at Tate Britain. It's much more quiet and relaxed and they have a great Turner collection.,Wonderful!
"October 15, 2014","Saw works of the masters and had headset giving clear, interesting descriptions and facts about each artwork.",Astonishing and you can take pictures of the artwork
"October 12, 2014","Free admission, and tons of fabulous art.  The cafe has a very nice and reasonably priced afternoon tea.",An amazing experience for art-lovers
"September 22, 2014","The National Gallery displays an amazing collection of renowned masterpieces from artists in the caliber of Van Gogh, Monet, Turner, Constable, Velazquez & many others that even people with limited art-related knowledge would recognize. The only downside in my opinion was the lighting which was insufficient in many parts of the Gallery, which seemed to rely too much on natural light.",The National Gallery at Trafalgar Square
"September 20, 2014","I love this whole section of London, and the National Gallery is an important part of it. The gallery is magnificent; breathtaking. Most of the museums in London, including the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery, are free. Both are adjacent to each other on the north side of Trafalgar Square, across the street from St Martin in the fields and just down Whitehall from the Palace of Westminster. Just behind the Gallery is the outlet for theater tickets and several theaters are very close. The only think that would make the gallery better would be if you could take photographs as you can in the National Portrait Gallery.",Just amazing.
"September 20, 2014",Could not be faulted. Great experience. Artwork is laid out in galleries in date format and as you move from room to room you meet the greats. Plenty of seating and space to move! Give yourself a treat and visit. Free entry too!,"Amazing collection of works, and free of charge too!"
"September 17, 2014","You can't possibly visit London and not visit the National Gallery. There's a plethora of beautiful paintings, the rooms seem positively endless and the next one is better than the one before! Do yourself a favour, especially if you are an art student or just plain love good art, and spend a good 3 hours in there! You won't regret it :)","A must, its central"
"September 7, 2014","Its for all ages above 6 yrs, and those who have younger children can stay outside like we did, I went first know what one should see and got back to take hand of our 3 yrs old while other family members got in,its a must and the area is so nice and enjoyable our 3 yrs kept running after the pigeons and there is a lot of street  amateurs who will give you a cheep shows.

"September 2, 2014","The National Gallery has one of the best art collections in the world (along with the Met (NY), the Louvre and the Hermitage).  But unlike the others, its free, so its easy to just slip in and see a small section or spend the day.

"August 30, 2014",How can you not love this art museum. it is so full of priceless work it takes your breath away....No entry fee and beautiful painting to enjoy. There is nothing to dislike about the National Gallery.,You can spend days here
"March 9, 2014","The only negative comment I can make concerns the inconvenience of several halls being closed for re-hanging. May have just been bad timing, but it disrupted the flow significantly. Don't overlook the Portrait gallery and the cafe in the Sainsbury wing is a great place to take a break and have a pot of tea.",long queues
"February 28, 2014",We wanted to see the sunflowers but the queue was just too long. However we wandered around the rest of the gallery and enjoyed it.,I still cannot believe it is for free!

"February 26, 2014","Amazing paintings, Da Vinci, Monet, Renoir, Manet, T-Lautrec and many more and the portrait gallery. A must go place while in London and it is free! One of the best place in London.",National Gallery - One of the top art museums in the world
"February 12, 2014","The National Gallery at Trafalgar Square is one of several outstanding art museums in London.  It houses a wide range of fine art, spanning the 13th - early 20th century, representing a 'who's who' list of Western Europe painters and artists from these periods.  The National Gallery was founded when the House of Commons who decided to procure 38 paintings and begin a national collection in 1824.  This small collection has now expanded to over 2300 paintings and is visited by over 5 million people annually, making the National Gallery the 5th most visited art museum in the world. Before you visit, it is helpful to have a look at the National Gallery Website or at least a good London guidebook so that you can have a feel for the floor plan.  If you want to visit the entire collection, we would suggest 3-4 hours, allocating approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour to each section (1. – 13th to 15th century – Medieval Early Renaissance, 2.) 16th century – High Renaissance, 3.) 17th century and 4.) 18th to 20th century.) Each of the major sections includes 15-20 separate rooms with numerous outstanding paintings.  For us, it is difficult to envisage visits to the Gallery without seeing the entire collection at the National Gallery.  However, for those with limited time, you might want to visit the National Gallery Website – Plan Your Visit section to see the Printed Trails and 30 Highlight Paintings webpages. These might help you target a specific group of paintings or plan for a shorter visit.  Regardless of how long you intend to spend at the gallery, it is highly recommendable to pick up the The foldable, red-coloured National Gallery Plan (£1).  This provides a simple floor plan with four major sections along with a few of the highlight pieces for each section. On the back is a list of the individual rooms as well as its featured artist(s) or art period/ movement.  The Plan is also quite useful for helping you navigate your way around the Gallery.  In addition to the impressive permanent collection, there are special exhibitions (usually require tickets), which take place throughout the year at the National Gallery.  Refer to the Gallery website to find information about the exhibitions and to book tickets online.  You can also purchase tickets directly at the National Gallery as well.  There are several food and drink options within the National Gallery if required.  These include the National Café, which offers a nice range of afternoon snacks, coffee and tea drinks.  You can also find the Espresso Bar on the Ground Floor and more formal dining at The National Dining Rooms on the First Floor.  The main shop is located on the Ground Floor and you can visit just before leaving the museum if you want to pick up a museum book or souvenir.  They have some nice books which include a vast majority of the works you will have seen within the National Gallery.   Overall, we highly rate the National Gallery in London and appreciate the comprehensive coverage of important Western European art movements which can be explored here.  We eagerly anticipate spending time at the Gallery when visiting London and consider it one of our personal favourite attractions in the city.",National treasure
"January 23, 2014","As always, thoughtful exhibits highlighting national treasures.  Great vistas from the portico, looking out over Trafalgar Square towards Big Ben.  Don't miss the gift shop, too.",awesome
"January 18, 2014",The range of art work is absolutely amazing and time just disappears.  The cost is a volunatry contribution which pays for so many support facilities and the retaurant and shop are well worth visiting,SPECIAL C0LLECTION
"December 25, 2013",A very intersting collection of paintings from all the EUROPE and different time periods.NO TICKET !!!!!!! very nice suvenir shop with many different items,Magnificent. Don't miss!
"December 13, 2013","The National Gallery like so many museums in London is free. What a treat. The building is located on Trafalgar Square, which is sort of a must stop and see spot with Lord Nelson statue towering over the plaza. The building of the gallery itself is worth a visit. Some of the treasures we found inside included Monet's famous bridge and water lilies, Van Gogh's chair and sunflowers. There were paintings from Renoir, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Van Dyck, and many more. Our favorite one was actually from a Finish painter we had never heard about. There are many treasures in this gallery. I highly recommend it. We visited on a Wednesday afternoon. The visitors in the gallery were quiet and respectful, and although there were a good number of visitors it was by no means crowded. Very enjoyable.",I was reminded I have a soul
"December 5, 2013","I stopped in here for 15 minutes.    4 hours later I was still here.    It is the strangest thing staring at a paintings you have seen images of on posters and mugs and learned about at school - here it is - right in front of your face!     How can a painting be 500+ years old?   It makes you think of how short life actually is when you consider how many generations before stood and looked at these things, and people will still be stood looking at them in the generations to come.............  (so long as they are not wrecked by morons trying to sneakily take photographs that is!!)   Go to the shop if you want a reminder.  Buy a print and contibute to the purchase of the next great work that comes up for sale.","Great place to visit, cafe is yummy too!"
"March 27, 2012","You can just sit and soak in the atmosphere in your favourite rooms, waiting for inspiration to strike (I'ma  writer not a painter, but it still works for me!) take informative tours about particular pieces, visit well thought out exhibitions such as the ongoing Turner one, or just go to the cafe for some good, imaginative, but unfussy food. (Perhaps a tad expensive but it could be worse.) Plus it's free to enter the gallery. Only downside is that you get sshh'ed a lot. Particularly Americans I've noticed! although I was once told off in 5 different languages for leaning to close to one small painting, which was an experience :D",Always Drop By
"March 3, 2012",I used to live in London and would just drop in to see one or two paintings sometimes. Being free is an excellent service to the public.,"My favourite gallery in the world, packed with master pieces!"
"February 5, 2012","Loved the range of quality art on display to see for free, gets very packed which can spoil the experience a little bit.",Always a winner!
"January 24, 2012",It doesn't matter how long you have in London ...it's always worth paying a visit. You can run in and do a top 10 must see paintings or whatever number you have time for ...or do a guided tour or hire headphones and take your  own time. We did a bit of each during our last visit. We tagged on to an interesting  free tour ( dropping out when we were invited to now go and do our own sketches!!) and then hiring headphones so we could listen to the superb background details and information about paintings that caught our eye. There really is something for all and it can be free if you are that way inclined..... I would hope everyone feels they should make a reasonable contribution to the funds of the Gallery .... a national treasure to be proud of!,The Leonardo Exhibition
"January 20, 2012","Brilliant, a very rare chance to see most of Leonardo's work in one place. Too many visitors were allowed to view. I booked tickets, which is essential if you don't want to line up from 6.00am. ",National Gallery - do it!!
"January 19, 2012",We passed away a couple of hours in here whilst waiting for dinner time!  Very informative and amazing to see all those fabulous paintings!,awesome
"January 19, 2012","Went with my 'arty' 10 year old, all i can say is amazing and a privilige to be able to see such works of art.",Makes me proud to be British!
"January 19, 2012","I had forgotten how wonderful the National Gallery is. It must be one of the most fantastic of its kind in the world. The immense wealth of wonderful art takes one's breath away. Every corner turned, presents a stunner that you can't believe is hanging there 'in the flesh'! We went primarily to queue for the Leonardo Exhibition, and luckily we got in. So many had travelled, and didn't. I'm on the mailing list now, so I can be prepared for the next time.",Free and amazing workes of art you read about

"January 17, 2012","Good all-in-one gallery in London for all you art freaks out there.Recommend you do this if you only have one night in London.Can find works from all kinds of artists, including some famous works that are seemingly on permanent exhibition.",how not to manage an exhibition
"January 14, 2012","We were fortunate enough to get tickets for the Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan exhibition. The trouble was that the National Gallery had packed too many people in at once, it was very hot and over-crowded. To get a good view of the paintings (which were glorious) was very difficult. People sat around on the benches fanning themselves with the programmes to try to cool off and overheated children cried. I'm sure the rest of the National Gallery must be well worth a visit, but this review focuses on the way that this exhibition was managed. Surely the NG could have planned the traffic flow and numbers better so that everyone could have an enjoyable time and a clearer view of the spectacular paintings. I hope they will manage future exhibitions better.",Amazing and Free
"January 5, 2012",Well worth a visit. We have been a number of times but on this occasion booked for the Leonardo Davinici exhibition which was outstanding (There was a charge for this). You could easily spend a few hours absorbing the amazing collections and it won't cost a penny - but expect to make a small voluntary donation as a gesture.I usually avoid the customary gift shop positioned at exits but this one is worth a visit. Its packed with unusual bits and bobs for the art lover.The building itself is quite an attraction and superbly located overlooking Trafalgar square.,FREE! Such a treat every time we visit London
"January 5, 2012",Overcrowded ona  wet Sunday but it didnt matter.  teh further up the floors we wnet the more people had fallen by the wayside and from the joy of the popular to the discvovery of the new we enjoyed every tiring step.  Of course we'll go again.,One of the most amazing artmuseums!
"January 5, 2012","I always go to The National Gallery when visiting London. A few minutes of peace and quite strolling around on my own. I always have a look at Turners ""Rain, Steam and speed"" when visiting the museum. Do look up in advance if there is an exhibition with an entrance fee and book in advance if interested.",A world class gallery
"January 5, 2012",A fantastic day out.  On sale is a useful highlight guide to ensure you don't miss the best paintings.,Just wish they weren't so pushy!
"January 2, 2012","My family and I arrived in London late in the afternoon and decided to rush over to the British Museum and National Gallery before they closed at 5 and 6, respectively. We got to the National Gallery 40 minutes before closing but they started kicking everyone out, even though it wasn't even 6 yet! Though my stay there was brief, the Gallery had quite a few interesting pieces, such as drafts artists such as Van Gogh went through before starting on their actual paintings.",LEONARDO DA VINCI EXHIBITION - WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
"December 12, 2011","Just visited the leonardo painter at the court of milan.You need to arrive before 7.10am to get a full choice of times for the day.I arrived at 7 and had 12 ahead of me.good atmosphere and everyone friendly.However, it was cold and people had soup, chairs, blankets etc as the tickets weren't sold until ten am.Worth every second, it was fab, i could buy four tickets for our group and they joined me at eleven, the time i choose.Would do it again, amazing .",Great collection of fine art.
"December 11, 2011",Fantastic collection of art-confusing map and rude staff.,"Nice gallery, but I have seen better"
"December 11, 2011","They have nice paintings and many famous too. It's big, but not so much that you can't see everything. I didn't like that the audio guide didn't have all the paintings explanations, but only the famous ones...",Its better than average
"December 1, 2011",Its better than average but not really very good in my opinion - However that's only because I am comparing it to the Tate which I think is truly excellent  - If you like old masters then you will love the national Portrait Gallery - I would go to the Coutauld and both Tates first tho.,Leonardo Da Vinci exhibition
"November 28, 2011","I was very much looking forward to visiting, had ordered the timed ticket and audio guide well in advance. Well I was wondering why there is timed entrance - the rooms of the exhibition were so full that people kept bumping into eachother, one couldn't admire the small preparatory and other delicate designs because of the amount of people.Also the exhibition is on 2 floors, one in the basement - the other at +2 which doesn't make it very convenient. I was worried seeing some elderly people trying to get to the basemunt getting down the stairs with walking sticks - the attendents should point to the available elevators.But then the paintings make up for all of this, and the audio guide is a definite plus.Oh and do leave your coat at the free deposit - it is really warm in there, I even saw some people with fans !",Wonderful gallery and it is free!!
"November 28, 2011",London is one of the few large cities which still has free museums and art galleries. The National Gallery is one of my favorite in London and is well worth an extended visit.,Excellent museum
"November 28, 2011",to wile away an afternoon.  Very well laid out and well worth a visit.,A London Jewel
"November 27, 2011",The National Gallery is truly a London jewel. Do not rush through this cultural and historical landmark. Take your time to enjoy the treasures that lie within. Perhaps you might hear the voices of the past that teach you something about the present.,"take your time, and the audio guide"
"October 27, 2011","Wonderful collection, and a real indulgence this time around. I spent a very enjoyable 4 hours in the galleries on this visit. the audio guide is fantastic value at £3, and is very helpful. I chose to start with the most recent works, and followed the rooms roughly backwards - skipping through the medieval religious art which isn't really to my taste.I looked at most of the work on the recommended 1 hour tour, but also used the audio guide to explore other paintings that caught my eye. It was a wet day, and the galleries were quite busy, but I was still able to get up close to the works, and the headphones blocked out most of the annoying chatter.I also had time for sandwich and cake in the cafe - very good quality - the British Musem caterers could learn a thing or two from here!!!Excellent all round. We are very lucky to have such a gem for free. Having paid very high entry fees to galleries in Rome, Paris and Amsterdam it makes me proud that in the UK everyone can have access to fine art.",Loved it!
"October 25, 2011",Amazing to see the old masters close up. Plus free admission..impressed with the staff who were helpful and knowledgeable..but wonder why they don't charge a small admission charge?,Huge Collection of Western European Art
"October 25, 2011","I walked it and was immediately in awe of the large size of the building and its countless number of artwork on display. The National Gallery showcased artists from Germany to Spain, Italy to Great Britain. I spent an hour there and only saw a third of what they had...and that was even with just glancing at several artworks and moving on. If you plan on seeing everything in detail, set aside one whole day.",great
"October 24, 2011","the gallery is just amazing, there are so many pictures to see very very good",What a gallery!
"October 24, 2011",Love the late opening on some nights.  And it's free!  Not all national galleries are these days.   Select 2 or 3 rooms per visit.....and spend time in these.  The gift shop is always worth a visit for things to take friends and family back home.,Great free attraction
"October 23, 2011",Love that the major museums in London are donation only. Used Rick Steves guide to navigate the museum. Good cafe inside.,Whistlejacket!!
"October 13, 2011","I love the National Gallery in every way! The catalogue of paintings is magnificent, including da Vincis and Van Gogh and a million others -plus my favorite Whistlejacket. Make sure you don't miss him, fantastic lifelike horse.  The lay-out is easy to navigate, unlike the British Museum and others I've seen.  The cafe is quite good and the location can't be beat. Lots to do in the area, or just sit on the steps and people watch. I highly recommend this for a nice afternoon.","Lovely, lots of really well known pictures on display."
"October 13, 2011","We really enjoyed the NG (not to be confused with the National Portrait Gallery next door)I did my research on the internet before we went to find out where the more famous pictures were located, so that if it was very crowded we would know where we needed to be. However it was very quiet, only about 6 - 12 people in each room, so it was really easy to see every painting - so much so, that we actually ended up seeing the whole gallery.We are a couple who enjoy looking at beautiful paintings, but are not very knowledgeable about them, so this gallery was perfect. And best of all  . . . it's FREE!",Outstanding Collection of European Paintings
"October 8, 2011","This is the most outstanding collection of European paintings in the world.  Admission is free and the labels explain the paintings well.  The collection was amassed primarily by non-royals and donated to the people. There is an excellent map available for one pound. If your time is limited, go to the paintings that illustrate the map. The docent tour we went on was excellent: a thorough explnation of a half dozen paintings in the space of an hour. The gallery has an excellent website. If you visit on a Sunday, try the English roast beef lunch with all the trimmings--the gastronomic highlight of a recent trip to London and Paris.",The beauty of the world under one roof
"September 27, 2011","It is a wonderful experience to enter this magnificent building which houses sucn national treasures. Spend a few hours here and refresh your soul with the wonders of fine art and sculpure from the old masters to the modern day artists. For the inner man, however, pop next door to the National Portrait Gallery. The food in their upstairs restaurant is superb and the views across London are stunning.",The Tudors
"September 22, 2011","An amazing gallery.  Also had afternoon at the National Cafe.  It was great!  And, reasonable price.  Don't miss St. Martin's across the street.  Free afternoon music if you can get in during practices.",What a fabulous place
"September 19, 2011","What an experience, if only there had been more time!",Beautiful
"September 19, 2011",The building itself is a work of art. This place houses a massive amount of art of all different periods. I'm not a bug museum or art gallery person but I found myself wandering in here for hours. There is so much to do and look at it could be a full day experience for the hard core art lover. For me two hours was enough. If you are worried about taking a non-artsy person here don't worry about it. They will enjoy it too at least for a few hours.,it was wet
"September 19, 2011",i did not enjoy gallery as it was religous but had a snack in restraurant  it was a big sandwich,Awe inspring
"September 17, 2011","An amazing collection of artwork in a fantastic location.  We took our three kids (8, 4 and 2) for about an hour, that;s about all they can handle at that age!  Oh and it is 'free' but you really should give a donation...The cafe in the basement is worth a visit for some wonderful cakes etc.",Wonderful!!
"September 16, 2011","I love this place. There's so much to see and take in. I only wish they'd allow visitors to take photos, as it would help me take notes and remember things I've noticed during my visit.",Super Attraction
"September 14, 2011",Take the time and visit this gallery!  I visit it at least 4 times per year and always find the paintings here captivating.  You can pop in for an hour and hit the rooms that of interest.,National Gallery...a treasure in plain London's heart
"September 11, 2011","The building is amazing, the location couldn't be better and the art pieces inside are overwhelming: from Da Vinci to Boticelli, from Vermeer to Holbein, Goya, Van Gogh, Cézanne, Gauguin...Give National Gallery one day, try next the National Portrait Gallery next to the building.Great great way to lift your soul!","Beautiful artwork, not great for everyone though ..."
"September 11, 2011","Although i really enjoyed my trip to the gallery, sadly my kids did not. This place is not for children, all other children i saw there were just running around, they had no interest in it what so ever, so not for kids.",Spend the day and get blissfully lost!
"September 3, 2011",No matter how many times I visit the National Gallery I always find an area I hadn't explored before. I could absolutely spend the whole day walking around here. Plus it's free admission how can you beat that? This is a must see for anyone traveling to London.,Make a game of it
"August 25, 2011",I knew that a visit to the National gallery with three children would likely be a disaster. So we did a bit of research before our trip a prepared a game for the kids.I pre-ordered a sticker book of National Gallery paintings online from Amazon (The Usborne Art Sticker Book) Then we made a game of searching for the paintings and then attaching the stickers in the book.  We managed to survive two hours before the kids got tired.,"Always great, a little disruption with renovations"
"August 25, 2011","Usually I  give the National Gallery a 5 star, which of course the works are.  Just now allow a little extra time as many works have been moved around due to renovations prior to the Olympics.  Staff are super helpful directing you to your favourite works.Why not donate a few pounds to keep it free :)",Always my first stop in London
"August 24, 2011","Having been to the National Gallery before, I decided to do the 'must see' pictures such as the Sunflowers by Vincent Van Godh, The Haywain by Contstable etc and my favourite painting by Jan Van Eyck - The Arnolfini Portrait.  Whats amazing about the gallery is that it is free so you can call in several times to see the paintings you wish to see as it is so tiring to see so many paintings in one day.  Had a wonderful visit and thoroughly enjoyed these famous paintings.  Every time I come, I get something more from the paintings which i see.  It is located in Trafalgar Aware and the station to get off at is Charring Cross.",A must see if you have European roots and foster your heritage.

Cheers to Michael, my awesome tour guide",Rude and hostile security staff made us feel uncomfortable
"February 15, 2023","Rude and shouty security on entrance - no need. Queued for ages , one man in charge of getting you to move through the scanner shouting at you to “Zip bag zip bag LADY” - he meant unzip. Bellowed at to “ MOVE MOVE” out of the way . The reason I didn’t immediately move is you were confiscating my daughter’s print she had bought at the Imperial War Museum as you aren’t allowed to take art in. ( who knew ?)  That’s ok - but she is autistic and you shouting at her and me to leave her side and get out of the way because I was apparently blocking your view was unhelpful and unnecessary . Just such a stressful start.  You are security not the FBI.",Fabulous on a rainy day (or any day really!)

Tickets checked 3 times, everyone wears masks but the automatic door doesn’t work - so everyone touches the same handle, for some reason after presenting the tickets I was given a tiny piece of paper that I needed to handle to someone throughout the visit, no audio guide (and no app to download info) so people still crowd next to each other to read info next to each painting (so much for social distancing). To contrast - two weeks ago I was in Uffizi gallery - and that was really well organised and very safe.",Go back again and again
"July 25, 2020","How lucky are we that our galleries are free? Impossible to do in a day, or even a week, but lovely to pop in regularly. Often there’s a short talk on a particular painting at lunchtimes. ",Best Paintings in the world....

"July 18, 2020",we loved going it for a cultural trip in london so we would go again for the next time we visit the city ,Loved the Gallery
"July 10, 2020",The Gallery is beautiful from inside and even more beautiful from outside. Absolutely loved it! It's full of amazing art.,NEVER BUY NATION GALLERY MEMBERSHIP EVEN IF IT IS £1
"July 7, 2020","Wow, what shall I tell you: NEVER BUY ANY MEMBERSHIP FOR NATIONAL GALLERY! Why? Because I've purchased my membership at the end of January 2020. I have seen 2 very crowded exhibitions (paying entrances were over £20) even though I have booked my time? Restaurants even with the membership discount are sooooo overpriced! Then the COVID-19 happened in March 2020 and I have not been able to benefit from paying for my membership. I have emailed about 4 emails to them asking them if they could extend my membership for free for 3 months? They were delaying their answer and cheekily someone phoned me recently before they just opened, asking me if I would be happy next year when I renew my membership to have 3 months added? I said NO AS I AM ASKING IF MY CURRENT MEMBERSHIP COULD BE EXTENDED BY 3 MONTHS...So for that reason I will never ever renew my membership with NATIONAL GALLERY..probably it is not worth it to pay over £70 as they have no more than 3 good art exhibitions per year anyway and the rest is free to see inside the gallery..",Unique in the world at so many levels
"July 6, 2020",I have been so many times and also a member for years. It is a home to everyone. It is such a welcoming gallery and you can enjoy all sorts of styles and still love the architecture of the building. A must-see. ,Impressive
"June 15, 2020","Given it was a rainy day the gallery was quite busy with a line to get in however as it is so big with so many rooms this was not an issue at all! The art and the history behind it was just amazing. Best of all its free! Highly recommend if you like art and even if you don't, just pop in and check out the grandeur.",The best place to go when its inclement weather in London

"February 11, 2020",I loved seeing the world through the eyes of the artists through history.Never been an art lover but my visit opened my eyes.,Light lunch.
"February 21, 2020","Good quality and choice of different styles of food. But what was on show was not really what we received. Just a sandwich on a plate with no garish or salad.  Told that was extra. Also I had to wait so long to pick up my coffee, my food was cold by the time I returned to the table. For what we received it was very expensive.  ",Lovely

"February 16, 2020",Most visitors probably wander through this amazing gallery without much planning but if you visit the website and study the galleries and do a little research into the individuals you will find your visit truly enriched--and may even discover some surprises as we did. This was our 3rd or 4th visit but so much more enjoyed by focusing on a few select galleries and having done some pre-visit reading.,Terrific as always

"February 10, 2020","Visited on a very windy, rainy day! Wasn't as busy as i was expecting but think the weather played a part in that, so was nice to be able to wander round without too many crowds. Was very impressed by the young gentleman member of staff who pointed us in the direction of Da Vinci's 'Virgin of the Rocks' as we wandered into one of the rooms, i wasnt even aware there was a Da Vinci in the gallery so i really appreciated being informed about it! The only thing that let our day down was when we asked a young lady on the membership desk if there was an area where we could eat our lunch we had brought with us, my partner was meat with a shrug of the shoulders and ""Not Really"" as answer! ",A fantastic display 
"February 8, 2020","A great display and the building alone is a work of art, you can get close to the paintings and really appreciate the detail that is in the artists work.Well worth a visit.",Pick an off peak time to visit

"January 20, 2020","A really good exposition of the genesis, technology and setting of a spectacular Leonardo painting. Of especial interest to us was to see the forensic and X ray analysis of each of the paint layers and even revealing the original sketch under everything else - itself totally different from the finished work ",Surprisingly good.

"November 20, 2019","My experiences of all museums & gallery in London has been top notch. It was first the National History Museum – exhibiting vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history; then I went to British Museum which has a myriad and exotic collection from 1000s of years of history. And third in the piece of this puzzle was National Gallery devoted to Paintings. And the best part of this experience was that all these were free in an otherwise very expensive city.Another wonderful aspect of all these were that the maintenance, exhibition and lighting of all artefact was top notch – the buildings were rather old but monumental and imposing with brilliant architecture. National Gallery with high carved ceilings and beautiful dome was no exception. While the collection of paintings for the uninitiated like me was not so obvious, there were kids and elders sitting in the halls and drawing sketches. Being from India, I carry all these experiences with me – hoping that we can emulate the art of creating and maintaining such wonderful museums. Must visit place for the art aficionados.",Great experience

"November 16, 2019",Yet another great exhibition with some stunning effects. If you’re a fan of Da Vinci don’t miss this whilst it’s on. Paying £4:00 to leave a jacket and bag in the cloakroom seems a bit steep but if it helps keep the Gallery going it’s a small price to pay ,lunch when visiting the gallery
"November 16, 2019","Sadly, the fish cakes were only just warm and the salad sparse Not really good value . More like a ""works canteen"" Staff good and  welcoming , well trained ",Magnificent.

"November 11, 2019","A very worthwhile exhibition featuring portraits and ceramics following Gauguin’s life and the changes in style and influences in both France and Tahiti. An enigmatic painter, who became influential in the development of western art but brought features of Polynesian  art and culture; though to the modern viewer he at times leaves one feeling uneasy in the way he exploited Tahitian  women,yet he did recognise the effects of French colonialism in trying to suppress Tahitian culture and religion.",Culture

I can pend hours wandering through its galleries...",Return visit to see the sights 
"November 11, 2019","The National Gallery with its free entry (donations happily accepted) is one of the best galleries 'in the World' (I haven't been everywhere) The rooms are spacious, the guards are fonts of knowledge and you can stand in front of major works of European art without feeling like you are in a rugby scrum. The Impressionist are well represented and if you like religious art you will be spoilt for choice.They have a number of shops, café and facilities that will help you on your journey to art bliss. You can't miss it if you visit Trafalgar Square. ",Disappointing
"November 11, 2019","As a National Gallery member this exhibition didn't cost me anything - I would have been pretty upset if I'd paid. A great idea to take one painting and study it in detail, but it just wasn't very well done and really short.",Beautiful Display
"November 8, 2019",Lovely view from the outside and in the inside. Free entry and needs more than half a day if you are an art lover,Just go!
"November 7, 2019","It's FREE and has amazing exhibits.  This last time I went, there was a wonderful Impressionists Exhibit.  I love being able to see works I studied in art school, up close and personal.",Gauguin
"November 7, 2019",Does the National Gallery need a review ? On this occasion I’ll make an exception as you can visit the  Paul Gauguin’s  Exhibition and the Leonardo Expérience.

"November 6, 2019","This museum sits right in Trafalgar Square, so, its location can't be beat. Their collection is very good for the years that it spans, and the rooms are organized chronologically. They don't have any paintings past the early 20th century, and there are no other forms of art (e.g., sculpture). The building itself is beautiful, with some neat mosaic tile floors. We liked it enough that we visited it twice during the week we were in London. As a side note, it was extremely crowded both times we were there.",Another great free “thing”
"November 6, 2019","It should be called “international treasures” - the collection is so vast it needs more than one visit so you don’t get “galleried out”. PS remember, the portrait gallery is just around the corner.",The Nations favourite
"November 6, 2019","It has something for all the family, be it modern or classical art, and they have an expensive but great cafe",Popped in to avoid a storm 
"November 6, 2019","The National Gallery was on our list of stops when we went to London but due to terrible weather we hid here for a while.Lovely place to visit with beautiful artwork. Would recommend that you hire the audio description as we didn't and struggled to get close enough to the popular exhibit to read the blurb.Cafe was busy, ridiculously overpriced and not very clean, so would suggest finding a cafe nearby for refreshments and there are plenty. ",Masterpieces in a Stunning Museum
"November 6, 2019",Every art lover must see this fantastic museum. So many of the masterpieces we've only seen in photographs are right there to be admired. ,Gorgeous museum
"October 31, 2019","Classic museum experience. I was especially pleased by the openness and lightness.  Of course, filled with people, but I never experienced the crowded feeling.  Anyone visiting London for the first time should put this on their must see list if they enjoy museums/paintings.",old mastersthis place is so full of old masters of all ages and painter

"October 29, 2019","Short and sweet. We went for a quick visit - 4 hours later... Captivating! Check out John Constable - yes, we all love him for  ‘The Haywain’, but just look at his tribute to Sir Joshua Reynolds. Wow!",Go for the wallpaper alone 
"October 29, 2019",I love the national gallery.It’s easy to spend the whole day inside. The artists are well signposted so it’s easy to get to Van Gogh if that’s what you are after.,Disappointed with staff/ museum attitude
"October 28, 2019","Went to national gallery with family members on a holiday where we went to most of the large museums in London. When we asked on entering the national gallery London where we could eat our picnic we were told by a member of staff that she didn't think there was anywhere in the building. We were surprised by this as the natural history, science museum both have picnic rooms for public use. When wandering the galleries we came across a sign which said 'picnic rooms' so we followed and found a room with long tables in and one lady and her young child eating their picnic so we went in and started to eat ours. After about ten mins the door was opened by a member of staff who ' demanded did we have permission to be in this room?' we all told him that it said picnic rooms and the sign on the door said public use. He told us that 'we couldn't just use it'. I asked was the room needed right now for a group? He just muttered ' don't bother' and left! We ate our lunch. My family and the other lady both commented how the museums attitude to the public eating in a picnic room was unfortunate and very contrary to other museums in London and across the country. This was half term and we could not find anything for the children to ' get involved' in art within the museum. ( No hands on areas, or draw your own picture etc) We have been to many museums with all our children over many years in many countries and we are very disappointed that Britain's own national gallery has made us feel unwelcome and does not see it has a role to play in encouraging people of all ages ( from young to old) to grow a love and passion for art. We saw the paintings we went for, which were amazing but I  would not return. ",Speechless
"November 4, 2019",The Art speeks for itself! I had only one hour free so i definitely need to visit it again in order to see everything,Absolutely love this place
"November 4, 2019","Its a wonderful gallery, you ned a whole day to explore it and the national portrait gallery next door. Highly recommend it for anyone visiting London.",A jem and a maze
"November 4, 2019","Really enjoyed an unplanned visit to the National Gallery, only a note on navigating the many many rooms: unless your intention is to see the whole collection, and that can take a few good hours, make sure you get a map, and even a pen to mark your own itinerary. May feel second millenium to do so, but it saves time and keeps the good spirits up. ",A Definite Must See
"November 4, 2019",Each time I visit London I make sure to visit the National Gallery.   There is such a beautiful variety of art work with some truly amazing pieces.  The cost is free which is truly appreciated.,One of the world’s great art galleries!
"November 2, 2019","The National Gallery London is so huge it can be overwhelming, but it is worth the effort! There’s so much fantastic art.  And there is a terrific tea room/restaurant in the building where you can refresh halfway through your expedition. Outside is Trafalgar Square, one of the iconic landmarks of London, and just a few blocks away is one of the best restaurants we’ve ever eaten at, “Scully”. Be sure to make a reservation!",Day Trip
"November 2, 2019","It was a relaxing place to visit.  The signage was a little confusing, but overall I was able to find all the paintings I was looking for.",It's amazing 
"November 2, 2019",We went here with us two sons. They enjoy to visit this museum.

The big one likes to listen and see all these fantastic paintings that we can find in these museum. A fantastic experience. ,a must visit if you are in london
"November 1, 2019","its great to visit in a rainy , windy london day ! the admission is free of charge and there are lots of paintings 15th to 20th century . its a very big space in trafalgar square , allow at least 3 hours for the visit .",Lots of portraits
"November 1, 2019",If you are into seeing portraits of the British aristocracy this is the place.  We went for the pre Raphaelite Sister exhibit which was fascinating.  I’m not sure I would have enjoyed the visit as much with out that and Konica at the Portrait Restaurant.,A piece of our culture
"November 1, 2019",You cannot miss it if you like the culture and the history of European art. Excellent exposition to visit also with family.,Great exhibition
"October 9, 2019","Great exhibition,  touching experience watching all the superior artists paints. Suggest coming right when the gallery opens",One of the great galleries of the world.
"October 9, 2019",This is not a gallery to miss if you are the least interested in art.  The Sainsbury Wing is particularly wonderful with a selection of  Venetian painter Carlo Crivelli (c. 1430–1495) far better than you can see in the Accademia in Venice. ,One of the best for family
"October 9, 2019","Superb place for the whole family to have fun. The children workshop programmes, lectures for grownups, special exibitions are also amazingly highstandard.",Lovely
"October 9, 2019","Very nice, as usual. Large halls with a variety of art that is for everyone's taste. The cafe is very good and with a nice choice of foods and beverages.",Outstanding Art Museum
"October 8, 2019",I arrived  when it opened at 10:00a on a Sunday.  Low volume of attendees for the first couple of hours. Recommend  purchasing the audio guide as I found it helpful to hear about the artist and any background info on the painting.  Art work covers 13th century to 1900 which provides excellent coverage.  There is only one da Vinci painting so if you are early I suggest gloing directly to the painting to avoid the crowds.,"So much to see, so little time."
"October 8, 2019",If you have a specific type of art that you like you can just see that section.  I could see what I was interested in in just 1 hour or 90 mins.  The building itself is wonderful inside too.  ,Great exhibition!
"October 8, 2019",Great selection of artist represented in the National Gallery.  This is worth the stop.  There is also a great pub to the right across the street as you are facing the front of the building.  Not the one in the church but a little further back.  Try the upstairs.,London
"October 8, 2019",Nice place to visit finding great locations for taking pictures an able to check the gallery on premises ,Great way to spend your Day!
"October 8, 2019",A hundred rooms of artwork all FREE for your viewing.  You can also take photos here.  Not acceptable in many venues in London like Westminster Abbey where you CANNOT take photos.

"October 11, 2019","Great location, free entry and some truly amazing art to see.  I always try to pop in if I am in London and see a different part.I do think they could have a few more maps to help you get round though But that doesn't detract from how close you can get to famous paintings",Fantastic collection and an incredible building both inside and out.
"October 10, 2019","This is probably one of the finest collections of art on Earth and completely free! The interior is incredible and you can find yourself enjoying the space as much as the paintings themselves. The guides around are extremely helpful and knowledgable, also we entered close to the closing time, yet was never made to feel rushed to exit, but instead given the chance to appreciate the art.",Worthy of Its Name
"October 10, 2019",The national gallery is a very comfortable museum. The galleries are large and there are many sitting areas. The artwork is excellent and is displayed accordingly. This is one of the best museums that we have visited on the continent.,Gauguin Exhibition
"October 10, 2019",The National always has good exhibitions. I saw the Rembrandt there and the Guaguin has just started which is a collection of his portraits,Great art and wonderful people watching
"October 9, 2019","In addition to the great art and the pageant of the gallery, there is a special pleasure to people watching. This is a very democratic museum. You might find historians of art on one bench and school children learning to sketch on another. People are taken with the imagery and that in and of itself is wonderful to witness. Go at your own pace, see what you want, stay long or stay sort, but go!",The very best
"October 9, 2019","Van Gogh, Monet, Turner ... you name them. The works of some of the greatest artists i the history of art exhibited in the very centre of London. Dont´t miss it!",This was a highlight of our visit.

"October 9, 2019","If you're used to shelling out big bucks to see famous works of art at the Hermitage, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Louvre, and the Museum of Fine Arts, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the cost of the admission to the National Gallery: it's free! I love going here when I'm in London because if I only have a few minutes I can always pop in to see a few rooms without having to budget an entire afternoon. It is also open late on Fridays, which is a boon in a city where many tourist spots close down by 5p.m. It is easy to find ""must see"" lists for this museum on the internet, but of special note are 4 Van Goghs (including one of his sunflower works), a couple of Rembrandts (including Belshazzar's Feast), a few by Rubens, and several Gainsboroughs. There is also a Seurat, a Degas, and a Turner work entitled ""The Fighting Temeraire"" that will be featured on the new twenty pound bank note starting in 2020. Those are just the highlights. There are hundreds of paintings in the museum and it is worth going to, if only for an hour or two.",Gallery in the heart of London

"September 15, 2019","Happened to be passing by Trafalgar Square at 5.30pm on a Sunday and decided to pop into see the Van Gogh. So happy I did. Trekking to room 43, we passed many beautiful high ceiled rooms housing all manner and styles of art. Loved the leather banquettes under a beautiful glass skylight!

"September 2, 2019","I took my 8yo daughter to the National Gallery as a quick stop during our recent trip to London. Since a lot of the museums in London are free to visit, we decided to do a quick walk through after a stop in Trafalgar Square. We probably spent 90 minutes in the museum, part of which was dedicated to a project they had set up for the kids - view a special exhibit painting, and make your interpretation of the armor worn by the angel in the painting. My daughter and the other kids were having a blast being creative and making their armor. It can often be challenging to take kids to art museums, so this was a great way to keep them interested.

It's free but a donation is encouraged and can be given in cash or card (there are staff at the entrance who can help you).",A hugh collection.
"August 30, 2019","The National Gallery is a very good gallery for what it is collection of West European paintings (including British) of the period 1250 to 1900.As far as modern art is concerned, the beginnings of Modern art in the late 19th Century are well represented. For latter stuff there seems to be little or nothing in the permanent, collection. Though occasionally there will be some truly modern  art among the temporary exhibitions.Its probably fair to say that some of the permanent collection is not that good, wall fillers perhaps. There is hoever a lot of great paintings (like Constables 'The Hay Wain') thet have entertained me on many visits.You are not obliged to pay to go in to the gallery so you can descide yourself how much the visit is worth. Which is convenient because sometimes you cannot stay long.Round the back of the National Gallery  is the National Portrait Gallery. It is mostly made of historical portraits of the the 'great and the good' of Britain.  There are some other kinds of portraits however. Each year, for a few months, the main contenders for the BP portrait award will be displayed there.",Just amazing
"August 30, 2019","The building in its location and with the architectural facade it has, facing onto Trafalgar Square are all impressive, and that’s enough of a reason to visit, but the art it contains is even more breathtaking. I found time on a work visit to London to have 30 minutes here at the end of the day before closing. I had to see my favourite JMW Turner’s  The Fighting Temeraire. I also took some time over Whistlejacket, another of Turner’s masterpieces, a Seurat and a Vermeer. Time well spent in an amazing place.",Embarrassed that have never been before ! 
"August 30, 2019",Getting to the age of 52 and having visited London hundreds of times (and lived there for several years too!) am sad to say have never been before. A wonderful experience not to be missed. Incredible artwork in a beautiful space. The cafe was good value and a nice spot to stop and have a breather ! ,Orderly
"August 30, 2019",This was our second visit to the National Gallery having been 7 years ago.   The place is huge but well organised.   Plenty of seats to sit down on in each room if you don't appreciate art as much as the rest of your family does.  Located right on Trafalgar Square and a beautiful building!,Moderately Enjoyable!
"August 29, 2019","So, these are the reasons why my review may be dismissed:  I come from a particular Christian background that disregards most other forms of Christianity.  While I don't ascribe to that faith now, it definitely still affects my tastes when it comes to admiring historical artwork (to give an example, my previous faith harbored on Jesus' occupation as a carpenter.  As a result, he wouldn't have been a weak-looking-man -- he would've appeared rather strong, so depictions of the Christ as lanky and un-muscular seem inauthentic to me, and I do not appreciate them).  I'm not a particular fan of Christian paintings -- they feel overwhelmingly inaccurate and redundant based off of my previous [fringe] Christian teachings.  Also, I only had a limited time to explore with my tour group, given our other plans.THAT BEING SAID, this is a wonderful museum.  I'm an American with a travel notice on my card and no UK paper currency, and they didn't harass me for a donation throughout my stay.  They did politely ask for a donation, but there's nothing wrong in doing that.  There were plenty of attraction in front of the museum itself, one of which, not to lie, seemed to be a collection of dance-gifted grifters entrancing the audience.  Their moves were okay (better than mine, absolutely, but not the sort that one would write home about), but they lacked variety.  Too many handstands and not enough choreography.The museum itself was painfully crowded.  Don't hold that against the National Gallery, though.  That's just London museums, it seems.  There are much too many people in this town on a given day.  The paintings had beautiful brushstrokes, even though they lacked in variety.  The pigmentation of the oil paintings was astounding and worth the trip.I would've liked a bit more variety in subject matter, though.  If I wanted to go to a wholly Christian collection of paintings, I would've gone to Vatican City, not London.  That being said, I can't say that I explored the entirety of the museum given my time constraints.   It's very possible (and hopefully likely) that I just happened to miss the exhibits focusing on other subjects.",London visit
"August 28, 2019","Free admission to see some of the greatest artworks! Convinced friends who don’t usually like art to come in. The building is beautiful and the artworks- Monet, Van Gough , so many greats. The gift shop had some nice items as well if that’s your thing. Worth dropping in to have a look. My friends were impressed even though they hadn’t expected to be.",London Trip 2019
"August 28, 2019",This is by far the best art gallery in Europe.No queuing required to get in.It’s well sign posted in the building so we didn’t have to wander around.The best part for us was the Van Gogh exhibition..I would highly recommend this as a family trip.There are many activities for children to take part in.On offer are headsets with various languages so anyone can understand what each artist is conveying( some of the abstract works were puzzling to me..!!),Well worth a look
"August 28, 2019",We were in Trafalgar Square so decided to pop in for a look around. Entry was free. Donations are accepted but no pressure.The building is grand and impressive. Each room/gallery has high ceilings. Lots of paintings with short descriptions. There is also an audio tour but we didn't  use that.We finished in the cafe for refreshment.,Well worth a visit

"August 14, 2019","Terrible service. Took a table in the restaurant in the main building at 12.00pm ,and had to call a waiter to our table at 1.00pm so as to place our order.  We ordered drinks and a portion of chips.  40 minutes later the chips arrived ,but no drinks.  After a further 20 mins we had to call the waiter again asking where our coffes were.  We were then approached by whom I assume was the manager, who in a semi aggressive manner informed us there wes only one person serving drinks.      Over 2 hours from start to finish for a bowl of chips and a lukewarm coffee.    .",A wonderful experience

"August 13, 2019","The Sorolla exhibit here was without compare.  And the permanent collection is a gem - I can stare at the paintings by Turner and Monet all day.  A reminder to tourists that all the large public museums are free of charge so there is no need to see every painting hanging on the walls in order to get your entry fee worth - I tend to go to a single room, or to see the works of a particular artist.  Use the museum's website to plan your trip if your time is limited or if you want to learn more about the collection.",Must visit if you're a fan of the arts. Unmissiable

"July 21, 2019","Amazing. I not an art expert, not even a novice. Blown away by the art. The pictures are so big. Real artists at work.",Great collection but overcrowded 
"July 21, 2019","Visited on a Saturday afternoon whilst in London for the weekend to find inspiration and admire some beautiful paintings but unfortunately the gallery was overcrowded which significantly deteriorated our viewing experience.Whilst it is an honourable idea to provide ‘free’ access to art for all (ie no, I’m not going to donate because I pay tax, thanks) the result is that nobody can view the art because there are so many people crowding around the paintings. What could be an inspirational, transcendental experience is turned into a football fan mob of people pushing each other and racing to see certain paintings by famous painters. Hopefully this situation will improve as this gallery experience is surely unsustainable. ",Monet's & Reniors
"July 21, 2019","Great visit to see some of the great masters originals. Free entry and great location just above Trafalgar square.

"July 20, 2019","I've been to the National Gallery on my own a few years ago and returned twice this year with members of my family. It is amazing to see from the outside, with Trafalgar Square right in front of the gallery, and the art is amazing. If you don't have much time, make sure to find a map of the gallery, it has a list of all the must-sees and their room number. I love taking some time to eat at the café before or after my visit. They have amazing coffee and tasty desserts.",Wonderful
"July 20, 2019","I haven’t been for a long time but it’s still as fantastic as I remember it being.From the outside you have Trafalgar Square which is brilliant for brief entertainment of young kids.The national gallery building is beautiful. So many rooms it’s easy to get lost but thankfully in every one there is someone to ask for directions.Plenty of seating in vintage leather sofas and wooden benches that mix so fantastically with the ornate paintings and decoration. Galleries often downplay their wallpaper so not to detract from the art but here it just adds to the experience.There is a huge amount to see and as long as you like classical styles of painting rather than ultra modern, you will find something to enjoy from smokey Turners to extraordinary religious pieces, to marble like botechelli and peaceful surats.Sadly, we couldn’t linger long as our daughter was getting really bored (it’s not the most ideal place to take young children unlike the Tate modern) but I will be back when she is older!",Just amazing
"July 20, 2019",Well worth a visit. Doesnt take long unless you are a big art lover and want to examine the painting. Its free to enter,It’s a feast for the soul
"July 20, 2019","I have been fortunate to work in London and hardly ever missed the chance to visit the gallery. As it is almost too large - and overwhelmingly awesome - to view in one bite. The best way is to select a section ie Dutch masters, Impressionists, Turner or Constable and just sit and soak up the grandeur and exquisite displays. ",a few hints
"July 19, 2019","you have to get off the undergound at Charing Cross, Leicester Square and remember that National Galery is admission free. Even if you were not interested in painting at the National Galery, you will be stunned. For me, the most interesting works of art in the Gallery are: Sunflowers Van Gogh, The Ambassadors, Hans Holbein the Younger, The Madonna of the Pinks, Raphael and The battle of San Romano.

"July 13, 2019",We primarily went to see the Spanish painter Sorolla’s exhibition. It did not disappoint.A truly gifted man.It’s always so thought provoking looking at people’s works of art. A thoroughly pleasant afternoon.,Stunning
"July 12, 2019","The collection of masterpieces is simply stunning. Also impressive is the accessibility. A meagre brass footrail (and in some places, hordes of school children) are all that stand between you and the European masters. And it's free!",Marvel at Masterpieces
"July 12, 2019","I could have spent several days and more time at the National Gallery.  Even the teen in our group was impressed!  But for a reason I didn't even know!  As soon as we walk in to the first gallery he announces ""I know this place!""  Never having been to London I had to ask how.  The National Gallery is in a scene of the James Bond movie Skyfall.  The paintings have been rearranged but he was excited to see the room and the paintings.I was slightly disappointed to find that ""Sunflowers"" by Vincent van Gogh was not available for viewing.Definitely crowded but worth the visit to see some of the best artists in history: Michelangelo, Raphael, Diego Velázquez, Monet...so much to see, so little time.If historical art work is your passion, plan an all day visit.  And don't forget to check events for surprises including hands on experiences.The staff was very helpful as I had to ask where the ""James Bond"" paintings were.  Never did I think I would ask that question in a Gallery filled with historical greats. ",Lots to see!

"July 11, 2019",The National Gallery has one of the most amazing art collections in the world and is one of the most beautiful as well.

"July 11, 2019","Some of the most beautiful galleries! Bee lined to some Da Vinci and Rembrandt pieces! It does get a little crowded but worthwhile! If you don't have time to get through it all, their website does offer a list of the top 30 paintings to see which is what we did.",Amazing!
"July 11, 2019","Easily the best collection of paintings in the Uk. The masterpieces of the Italian painters are some of the finest outside Italy. If you would like to see Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, Caravaggio in the same collection, the NG is a must!",Free but crowded
"July 11, 2019","We only had 30 minutes so we went straight to the Cezanne and Degas gallery. Because entry is free it gets very busy with large groups of kids, with a fascination for taking photos of every painting! All very well but some people just want to admire the picture without taking a photo of it!The shop is very well stocked with postcards of most paintings so they could buy these! ",Cultural immersion
"July 11, 2019","Flying out late on Friday afternoon, I made time to check out the National Gallery having missed it on previous visits.

"June 22, 2019",I am a huge fan of Monet and other Impressionists.  It was so great to see so many.  I was a bit disappointed that the Van Gough Sunflowers painting was moved to a different museum.,So much better than the Louvre!!
"June 22, 2019",If you are taking a European trip to see art this is a must see.  We spent a day here and could have stayed much longer.  The museum is not over crowded.  It is also quiet and has a lovely cafe inside.  The art will knock your socks off.  Security was quick and efficient.  If you are debating here or the Louvre be sure to come here.  The difference in your experience of the art is 100% better.,Broad collection very well presented.
"June 22, 2019","Although entrance is free a donation of 10 £, $ or € is recommended and the visit more than justifies it. The collection is logically laid out with clear signage enabling either a focused visit or a more leisurely browse through the ages. Headphones are available for £5 although most of the signage is informative. The collection is extremely broad with an excellent representation of artists, styles and periods.A great way to pass a few hours. Highly recommended. ",Stunning works you must see

"June 13, 2019","The National Gallery deserves its reputation as an amazing, extensive art collection. One tip, however: the map, which is way overpriced, is completely adequate. It gives the lay-out of the rooms and their numbers, but it gives no information about where various works are. The audio guide, however, is excellent, and it includes a map that lists famous works and their room numbers and has a clear map of the layout of the rooms. With the audio guide, this is a wonderful art museum and is a must-see, if one is visiting London.",One of the best!

"June 5, 2019","The national gallery has a terrific variety of artwork, and one can spend many an hour there. The art however is very 'classical', by which I mean there are lots of portraits and landscapes, and not much in the way of current art.But, worth a gander.",Great visit

"June 7, 2019","In all of our visits, we had never gone inside the National Gallery.  It takes up the entire north side of Trafalgar Square.  The building is just stunning.  It houses one of the finest collections of Western European paintings in the world from around 1250 onwards.  Its masterpieces include artworks from arts such as Botticelli, Titian, Raphael, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Cezanne, Hogarth, and Gainsborough.  The National Gallery was established for the benefit of all, not just the privileged.  It has always been committed to maintaining free admission as well as keeping a central London location with access for everyone.  Pay particular attention to the floors – the mosaics are exquisite and don’t miss the dome. We happened to be there when they had a small, but delightful exhibition by Boilly – Scenes of Parisians Life.  And, take the time to go around the corner and visit the National Portrait Gallery which is also free.",The best museum
"June 6, 2019","There is a lot of paintings and some rooms about oil paintings. Different rooms have different styles of oil painting, and each painting has its own characteristics. There are two paintings that interest me very much. One of the painting is a pink beach and a blue sea. When I saw it I felt very romantic.I went to the National Gallery by Bakerloo Line of Underground. I exited at Charing Cross station. If you are hungry you will find a coffee shop and you can buy some bread. And you can take some photos nearby National Gallery. Because, in front of it is a large square and a beautiful fountain and sculpture.",The best gallery ever!

"May 26, 2019","We have visited an amazing exhibition about paintings around war time. Big enough space, wasn't too busy on a weekend. Lovely time for an afternoon.",Great way to spend a few hours in London
"May 26, 2019","Great Glallery to wander around with an incredible range of pictures to find and enjoy.  I particularly enjoyed the 18th and 19th century paintings (Constable's through to Impressionists) but you will find so many pictures you recognise, and so many others that just capture your eye and your imagination, that you will happily lose yourself for hours in the gallery.",Amazing gallery and often less visited than it ought to be
"May 26, 2019","I was impressed, deeply.  The National Gallery is well laid out, beautiful, and full of works from all eras.  The paintings and other pieces are displayed wonderfully, and it is one of the less crowded of the major London museums.Highly recommended.",National Treasures
"May 26, 2019","Apart from the beautiful paintings and artwork on display, the National Gallery itself is an absolutely beautiful building. Add it to your list of places to visit and allow two to three hours to get around the place. There are coffee shops inside and rest areas along the way. For a quicker visit, select the rooms you want to visit and plan your trip accordingly.",Beautiful place
"May 26, 2019","Have not been here since I was a child. The different rooms with so many amazing pictures were incredible, with paintings that showed what people wore and did 300-500 years ago. Love that Rembrandt really was the earliest king of the selfie! So wonderful to see Picasso, Monet, Degas and many more.",Excellent art gallery

"May 26, 2019","It was stunning to see art works by some of the greatest, most famous artists in the world! Museum was clean and staff was friendly. The fact that it is free was definitely a bonus!",Awesome Visit at National Gallery
"May 7, 2019","Our visit to the National Gallery was wonderful. We did the ""touristy"" thing outside taking plenty of pictures in Trafalgar square, and then headed into the N G. Beautiful layout and the paintings are magnificent. How fortunate Londoners are to have such a grand place. We saw Monet's, Cezanne's, Van Gogh, etc. You could spend a lifetime in here and not see it all. We were fortunate to be there on a Friday and across the street at St Martins in the Fields was a free lunchtime concert! This is a busy, busy part of London, but easy to get to from Charring Cross station. We had a wonderful time.",The Art of Appreciation and Learning
"May 7, 2019",A collection of art that is timeless and cannot be appreciated or loved enough.Walking through the various art displayed in the many sections and hallways is an unforgettable experience that brings out the aesthetic of European art in particular.You can get a hearing aid and a map to guide you through certain sections.It’s a place for appreciation and learning that must be experienced. It’s a joy to see the masters of the past who are appreciated today and the works that are displayed show humankind’s aesthetic potential.5/5,Great place
"May 6, 2019","Love it, had a great time with my family in this lovely place. If you visit London definitely is a good spot.",Just lovely

"May 5, 2019","A very large museum which is free to enter.Negative points, not very exciting and staff did not appear to be knowledgeable of the museum.Limited artwork.",So many paintings!
"May 5, 2019",There is an almost incredible amount of painting from a great diversity of styles and times. This is what a gallery is supposed to be. You'll need a couple of very full days to see it all in a non-rushed manner. ,So impressive
"May 5, 2019","An extremely large and well planned gallery. You could easily spend a whole day (or more) here but it is also the kind if place you can come to for a couple of hours and still see some brilliant and really iconic works. Due to a busy schedule we opted to spend 2 hours here. There was no que at 10:15am when we entered. We decided to see the early medieval galleries, Da Vinci and then moved through the 1600-1700 galleries (absolutely amazing) to see Rembrandt before descending the stairs to exit. The fact they don't charge for entry is quite astounding given the thoughtful and beautiful way the art is laid out and the grandeur of the building. The staff were all helpful and seemed friendly. If we have the chance to return to London we'll be back!",Fascinating - and free!
"May 5, 2019",Great collection of marvellous works - and it is available for free. The range (time and style) is impressive. Makes for a good morning or a good afternoon in a London.,Sean Scully's 'Sea Star' abstract landscapes are terrific!
"May 5, 2019","This iconic British gallery has a huge amount of fantastic work, covering centuries, in addition to the very modern current exhibition of Sean Scully works, so go anyway as its free! See my pics below","Coffee at National Gallery Cafe, London "
"May 4, 2019",I visited the cafe at the National Gallery for a quick coffee on Thursday 2nd May 2019 as I walked back to Kings Cross following a business meeting. I was greeted warmly and shown to a table by the male head waiter.  30 mins later I was still waiting for someone to take my order. Although busy it was not as busy as sometimes. I attracted the attention of a waitress who came over and took my order. Eventually I got my coffee. Staff were rushing about looking hassled and the head waiter was joking and chatting to another waiter but not serving the tables.  I finished my coffee and then waited a further 30 minutes before someone was available to bring my bill. I left feeling frustrated at the quality of service and will not go back.  I thought it would be a treat going to the fantastic National Gallery for a coffee but the staff were inattentive and slow and didn't seem able to cope with the numbers of people. Disappointing! ,Sorolla Exhibition 
"May 12, 2019",Excellent visit to my favourite place in London. The work of the Spanish Master of Light is not to be missed.,Classic
"May 11, 2019","As many places in London, this also is perhaps a must visit. Excellent place and located in London city center,.",Outstanding 
"May 11, 2019",I have lived in London for a long time and have never visited the gallery. I wish now that I had not waited so long. What a great resource for London. The Sorolla exhibition is outstanding. ,Quick visit
"May 11, 2019",Had half an hour to spare before a show so popped in to revisit my favourite Turner paintings. Always worth another look,Lovely art work and helpful staff

"May 10, 2019","Right on Trafalgar Square, everything about this gallery is pleasant. As you approach through Trafalgar Square, you already hit the high note. The galleries and their curation are beyond belief. I will recommend making a shortlist of your own before the visit and focusing on the same. Khanacademy has got some nice videos of about 10 national-gallery-paintings. Touching upon those before the visit will help.",great places
"May 10, 2019",Love these places in London.You have to visit these amazing places in London Comming back every time we are in London ,National portrait gallery
"May 9, 2019","Located on Trafalgar this is well worth the visit. Find all those people you’ve read about , seen in movies or magazines. Writers, noble , musicians, royalty, all the notables of England.",Lots to see.
"May 9, 2019","Enough here for a full day at least!  With free admission,  you can always see a bit at a time & then go back later.",Incredible
"May 9, 2019","The National Gallery is remarkable and a must-see for any lover of painting. We spent hours in the Sainsbury Wing. It has the best collection of Italian masters I have seen outside (and maybe inside) Italy. The Impressionist galleries were mobbed late in the day. If you really want to appreciate these many great works, I might suggest a early morning visit. I also highly recommend the excellent YouTube videos produced by the National Galley as a preview to any view. The curators do a great job of giving context to the artist and the selected work. ",Beautiful
"May 9, 2019","Beautiful architecture and scale. Amazing artworks, peaceful and relaxing in a generally busy place in London is achieved due to the class of people it attracts and the grand scale of the rooms. ",Afternoon Tea
"May 9, 2019","We met our friend, who stayed with us 22 years ago when as a student she stayed with us.  This time our friend came with her daughter, who we hadn't met before and it was wonderful to catch up.  As they live in Switzerland English Afternoon Tea was a completely different and enjoyable experience for both of them.  We were seated very comfortably in the National Café and were made to feel very welcome.",Very nice
"May 9, 2019","A review of world artists. Interesting. Quiet, because there is no crowd. Beautiful building and square in front of it.",So much fabulous art - especially if you engage with it more deeply
"May 9, 2019","The whole collection is obviously amazing - in fact overwhelming if you try to see it all in one visit.  If you're lucky enough to be able to visit multiple times I think it's much better to just do a few rooms each time so you can soak up the skill and aesthetics of a particular artist or movement. Better still go along to a 'Talk and Draw' session on Friday lunchtime and spend an hour really engaged with just one painting.  Its free and the gallery provides folding seats, drawing boards, paper and pencils.  A member of the gallery team talks for a while about the history of the chosen work for that week and then sets you a drawing challenge based upon it.  And then you draw.  Its an amazing way to make you really look at a picture - you get totally absorbed in what you are doing despite the curious tourists wandering by.  Even when the subject is not a painting that you particularly like, you end up with a greater understanding of the composition and, in my experience, a deep admiration for the work.  Highly recommended!",Amazing Place 
"May 8, 2019",Only in London can you visit priceless works of art for less than a visit to a church or cathedral. National Gallery is an amazing place with wonderful works of art by nearly every great artist. The place is very big and you can spend hours in here so plan accordingly. I won’t repeat what everyone else is saying except go visit this place!!,Always amazing
"May 8, 2019",Been here many times and it is always fascinating.Liked the restaurant too and it also has the best souvenir shops.,Nice Place To Vist...

"May 8, 2019","The National Gallery is a 'must see' when you go to London. There are so many spectacular paintings here including one of VanGogh's Sunflowers. It's a huge place and can be overwhelming so just pick a few galleries that interest you most and visit them, and then go for a tea or lunch next door in the crypt of St. Michael's of the fields. It's a great way to spend a morning!",A must in London
"May 8, 2019",You can missed while in London especially it’s for free. Painting from all over the world. Great activity for a rainy day!,My Favorite London Museum

"May 3, 2019",We visited the national gallery on a vacation in England. So much to see here. If you’re into art then this gallery is a must see. ,"Great museum, extremely slow restaurant"
"May 2, 2019","The museum itself is fabulous and deserves an excellent. However, the restaurant was disappointing. Our order did not come for over 20 minutes. Our waiter took our order and never reappeared. We had to summon another person to retrieve our oder. It was a terrible waste of time when we could have been in the gallery.",One of the top world museums

"April 23, 2019","Just have to say that it was such a good vibe in the dinning hall of the National Gallery that we went there twice in the 4 days we where in London.

"April 22, 2019",The Sorolla exhibition is a MUST SEE. The incredible canvases filled with so much sunlight and movement. The brush strokes are mesmerising.The children on the beach. The colours of the water on their skin. He certainly was the Spanish Master of Light. ,Great variety of paintings
"April 22, 2019","We spent a couple of hours here, and will definitely return on a future trip, given the chance. There were many styles of painting to choose from, and we were glad to see some familiar ones. Having just come from Amsterdam, we were particularly drawn to the large galleries of Dutch artists. Barely scratched the surface, and could probably spend a couple days seeing this place at a leisurely pace.","Many, many, Lord/Lady pics."
"April 21, 2019","Art is always in the beholder's eye, so if you like a lot of allegorical paintings from the 1500-1700s this might be the place for you.  Very little Impressionism, hundreds of Lord and Lady pics, and only a smattering of the Still Life paintings that seem to be the province of British Art.  A good collection in a good space, but it all depends on what you like.",
